nveg3r,A game where you are a spirit and must find something without a soul,"(I'm a mess right now. I wrote this for the first half to be thematics and second half to be mechanics)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBasically -\n\nIn this game, you play in a medieval fantastical world as a wandering spirit. Everyone ignores you - but your roguelike missions *need* you to screw with powerful people like the king.\n\nUnfortunately, it will be almost impossible to screw with people. You can't possess objects with souls.\n\nTo kill the King you could possess a suit of armor or the tax collector (a soulless monster) and proceed from there with unique paths as you basically progress the game with upgrades you want. If you go through the armor route, you go through different parts of the story and from the perspective of the royal guards, whereas the tax collector interacts with peasants and you visit different areas.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFactions like the farmers are extremely hard to take down, as \n\n1) The livestock, farmers, and plants all have souls as they are the most folksy people out there.\n\n2) Your upgrades are not great as you will mainly possess dolls and scarecrows in this area.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEtc, the game progresses with a non-linear structure where you can progress any area at any time, but you may not be powerful enough. The game subverts what you think is the hardest boss (the soulless devils, evil kings, and powerful mages are some of the easiest to take down) versus the most humble being the easiest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor upgrades, you gain them by possessing objects, and retain some upgrades from before.\n\nFor example, if you possess the suit of armor, you gain a kit with reduced damage, lower speeds, and have a few abilities you can perform with your sword like dashes and parries.\n\nIf you leave the suit of armor to possess a corpse of someone you kill, you gain the corpse's new kit with increased health and poison attacks, and on top of that get parries and blocks.\n\nUpgrading again gives you both poison and parries with your new kit, etc."
nvdyyp,You know how people have less physical contact while playing video games what’s make a video game that about making physical contact with your family for building cities your parents are gods in the game for some reason and the goal is for the kids it’s to build a army of npc to defeat the gods joke,This silly little joke would take place during the middle evil times lol and would let the whole family play together lol and build their oh and cities and have wars A kid be a stress relieving Family base game to stop kids from annoying each other lol The family could have wars inside the game The family can pick two go away from each other and make their own civilization somewhere else Time would be going on The more the family plays there would be all sorts of weaponry lol The family could use to fight each other it would be a mobile bass game on one battle royale sized island that would let the family builder buildings and more starting from basic vehicles like the wagon going up two cars The family could die but would be revived after one second as an Eagle from the sky like you know what I’m going to be a bad babysitter and drop this baby and your family member is now a baby inside the game that you have to take care of teaching the family how to take care of the baby also helping them to stop arguments through the video game and let parents be mid evil gods over their children yaaaaaaaaaa this is just a joke game but if someone made it I would die of laughter
nvcz56,Isometric strategy game where you can play as nature,"Most strategy games focus on human development, but I'd like to have a twist on this, and make nature a faction in the fight. It would have to be a little supernatural of course, so a setting where woods growing back in days, and animals fighting in a coordinated matter would fit this game even more.\n\nIt could be a regular strategy game, like Civ, but the player could choose nature as their faction, and if they go with a human faction, they'd have to consider that their mine could collapse if the nature faction decides to ""attack"" that mine.\n\nBeyond this I don't have a lot, I just think it could be fun, and an interesting spin on the genre to have a non-human element in a meaningful way."
nvc299,Tsunami survive the friends,In this game there are five islands kind of big but not too big there is a giant tsunami that will kill everybody unless you kill your friends it is a big PVP bass game \n\nPage 2\n\nIf you manage to kill your friends you get a giant blood text saying was that worth it  with a giant tsunami washing it away into the sand killing your player in the process\n\nAnd then the game restarts you can only play with online friends or play with random people either way the goal is to travel through portals and kill your friend before the tsunami takes your life you have five people and the goal is to kill all your friends if you do this we all know what happens it was not worth it
nvbokj,Online Co-op games similar to like GTFO/Left 4 Dead maybe rogue like and in a fantasy style like skyrim or something. Mainly just more online Co-op games seems like a genre that isn't as big as others at least to me. Just want more games to play with friends not online pvp,
nvbg7r,1:1 scale of the ancient Roman empire. 28 B.C. MMORPG,"Microsoft flight sim was able to capture the entire earth on a 1:1 scale. This would obviously require less than that, but you'd need to delete every existing modern building/dam/mining site, then reshape the land to how it was before erosion/deforestation. Then, hire a team of artists to recreate each city to the best of their ability to how it may have been in 28 B.C.  and that's before A.I. I know, no easy nor cheap feat I can imagine. \n\nIf you're still reading then it will start off in the tutorial, which is in a random city/town across the empire. You're still a teen and will have a tutor or probably a school with other players learning the culture, traditions and religions with hired actor Stephen Fry as the teacher cause it has to be. Everyone starts as a middle-class roman citizen. You can learn your father's(if you have one) craft and continue that path or make your own path. Join the legions, travel the empire, turn to banditry or try to get your family name recognized to become a patrician so you can run for office. \n\nI would have to create a gofund me for this and use a similar development style as Star Citizen just doing it piece by piece. I just haven't figured out funding yet. Can't really sell chariots like you can spaceships.\n\nAnyways, I've posted this idea in here awhile back but I've kind of refined it and thought about it more. Don't know where else I could say this and not come off as a complete lunatic."

nv8e50,A rpg game idea. Fates choice,"Every millennium a monster is reborn in your home country and every year adventures chase after the beast as it destroys city after city the only clue to its path in the ruins of the homes it has destroyed. But you brave adventurer have decided to join the hunt and kill the monster by going to the first city it has destroyed but Fate has other plans.\n\nThe aim of the game rescue, raise, and train as many children as you can to help fight the monster.\n\nBefore the end of the game player character dies of old age and now you most play as your children and defeat the monster.\nThe amount of children depends on how many destroyed villages you go to and your kids age/Level is dependent on how many fights/ training you've given them by either bringing them on side quests or bring them along to rescue more children from destroyed villages."

nv49xf,Death and Harmonies: A small wholesome game in pixelart with focus on storytelling and a fun gameplay,"Setting: A dystopian world in wich people are dying because they are losing their life energy: Their Harmony. I imagined all of that more in a traditional chinese kind of style.\n\nGameplay: Given that the idea in my head is called ""Death and Harmonies"", I'd imagine some kind of rythmic based game. Not like Osu! or anything like that, maybe more like crypt of the necrodancer. Basically, you have to figure out the rythm of your own harmony while making your way through the parcour style levels. If you mess up, you might get caught.\n\nStory: I really want the story of this game to be something that you experiance while playing. Something that you get familiar with bit by bit. And I imagined there not just to be a main story, but also sidestories, that you get to know in or between levels. Maybe old friends, or people that could have been friends, if the world wouldnt lose its harmony.  \nThe Main story would be that the earth lost its own harmony and how that happened. In the end, when you reach your final destination, you are presented with a choice, to give your harmony for the entire world.\n\nMultiple Endings: Sounds scary, but I really liked the idea of multiple endings in this game. Not in the first playthrough maybe, but if you play it again, and the world is already saved, you can use your harmony to save your friends lives. The friends are the ones that you get to know in the sidestories, so you have like 5 endings in total or something.\n\nWhat I want for that idea: Nothing. But please, if anyone feels inspired by this idea, let me in on the process of making it. I dont really know how to code, I tried it in school and I think I wouldnt finish this in a way where I am in peace with myself, but I consider myself fairly good at writing, so I would gladly do the textwork for that game.\n\n\~cheers"

nuzmsm,I want to make a game,Hi! I'm skilled game developer. At least as far as art is concerned. I'm not very keen on coding. This is my weakest point. But I'm good at Unity and Unreal with it's BP.\n\nI like to play simulation games or strategies. And when they are combined.\n\nI wish to make a good non-trivial game related to one of this genres. I understand and accept the fact that I'll need a help of a programmer. Or may be I could do it myself using blueprints or PlayMaker or even Construct 3.\n\nIt doesn't matter whether I make a 2D or 3D game. But 3D is preferable.\n\nPerhaps you have some ideas of businesses or non-standard professions that would look good in the context of a game?

nuygy5,Gravity centric 3rd person arena combat.,"3rd person arena combat with weapons and/or skills on a map that is the inside surface of a globe. Like a hollowed out planet. There are structures(akin to space stations) and moon like objects(floating/orbiting moons &amp; asteroids) that the player can jump onto from the inner surface of the globe, or use to slingshot to different areas of the map, or to get onto one of the floating structures. I imagine playing with the intensity of the gravity of all the objects would be fun. It also seems like managing the camera is way too hard."
nux862,"A twist on a battle royale, in which you have 5 minutes to drop in and get as many kills as you can before the round ends and everyone drops again. It's like ""speed-round"" battle royale.","IMHO those hectic, thrilling, wacky, unpredictable starts are among the most fun parts of battle royale. The game is focused on this aspect the most.\n\n****\nTo make it to the second round, you'll need at least 1 kill. To make it to the third round, you'll need 4 kills. The fourth round, 10... and every round after that has progressively tougher kill minimums.\n\nThe good news is that your kill count carries over from previous rounds. So for example: even if you didn't get any kills in the third round, your crazy first round is still letting you move on to the fourth round.\n\nWhen there are only a few people left, say 5-10 players or so, you're all put into a new full lobby together (but still only scored against each other) while the kill goals get *redonkulous*. Last player remaining —or— the one with the most kills when nobody can make it to the next round, wins.\n\n****\nDue to the speed-round nature, the drop-in section is designed to reward skillful flying and not be just boring gliding. For example, maybe you have you're strapped to a rocket with limited fuel to boost... but you need to save just enough fuel to retro-boost at the end so you don't take fall damage and die. You could even push it right to the limit like a landing SpaceX rocket. And because there are no easy soft landings, landing on top of towers or good vantage points is tricky. Risk vs Reward."

nupwua,My ideas attempt 2,What we do is A survival base game that requires the player to make alliances with other battle royale islands kind of like clan wars but instead of having A goal it’s about fun and war that will let you start epic battles against friends or online players \n\n\nPage 2\n\nI feel what would be great is if you can build in this game structures walls prisons shops anything you can think of you can build it giving the game creativity all why being a 3-D shooter game\n\nPage 3\n\nWhat happens if you die respond no actually it’s a bit confusing you will be sent to the afterlife and you have to escape to the surface if you die you turn into a shadow demon you fight yourself because your character feels that he’s a bad person blah blah blah if you die you go to earth and start a zombie apocalypse with your soul coming out of your chest just the average game \n\n\nPage 4\n\nJobs this is how your civilization battle royale map Will actually deal with enemies you can build stores as I said above you can be a scientist you can be a robber who steals for money which means you join enemy teams side if your scientist your goal is to stop the zombie apocalypse or to kill aliens we get to that later also you can be a cop to put away criminals or you can be in the army\n\n\nPage 5\n\nThere will be other planets you can travel to and take over that’s why you need a rocket ship to kill aliens and make them join your team by reviving them reviving we get into later after you do this they join your team you can only have 10 of them The rest stay on the planet you can bring 10 home to fight for you there is about 12 on the planet if you bring 10 home same you can build on The planet\n\nPage 6\n\nReviving is for teammates and enemies\nWhoever you revive joins your team but if you revive a enemy they don’t join your team they just can’t fight you they have to fight other people servers\n\nPage 7 \n\nDon’t be mad if someone grieves your base they are allowed to but please do not grieve more than you need to Breaking open the wall is fine but please for the love of God don’t break their buildings they can actually get banned for grief more than they need to I feel it’s just kind a rude to grief more than you need to if it blocks the entrance it’s OK but please be nice you can use guns or vehicles\n\nPage 8\n\nGuns and vehicles are how you travel to other peoples bases they have guns attached to them there’ll be a cut scene  of you traveling to they’re base now you can open fire you have to enter the code into the vehicle just pick the server that you want to rob /raiding\n\nPage 9\nThe after life will be a very weird place\nEvery time you escape it makes it harder for you to escape by turning into a hell version of a random server\n\nSomeone please make this game\nAlso pick the random server by how much building is in it so you can use peoples Plains if it is in the server of hell also every door will be open obviously there would be key cards and cameras that you could use in the over-world you could put cameras anywhere and you could see it from the phone that you have on your character you have to put in the server name after you do it saves it into the phone and you had never have to do it again
nunsuo,My game idea for a military shooter that turns into a mystery for the player to solve all way trying not to die to fight in a battle Royale war Battle royale server war fighting against other servers,The idea is there would be server wars between battle royale‘s where you have to build on the server that you get and expand with people as in players and MPC‘s players can help you defend and MPC’s can help you defend There is a total of 25 players 10 MPC’s and 25 enemy players allowed The idea is you would build on your island to defend the island from enemy players from different islands but the mystery comes in the afterlife after a player would die he would have to escape the afterlife either as a shadow demon or a human he will be fighting himself it sounds weird but stick with me after your character fights in so many wars he feels that he’s a bad person and that’s why in the afterlife he is fighting himself it is because he doesn’t want to do it anymore but he’s forced to but if he goes back above as a shadow demon his one goal is to let his soul get out of his body which will start a zombie apocalypse of the undead to end the war and destroy his own team and work for the enemy team if he gets out as a shadow demon which is why there will be jobs in your base Island very scientist or there is Robert which means you are not on anybody’s side there is a cop in there is the military everybody can have shops though to support your team also if you choose to be a robber then you get put in jail for a very long time not even in game minute you have to escape the jail and you could be recruited by the enemy team if you do oh so you can travel to planets to kill aliens that can become NPC’s to defend your base and give you alien weaponry this awesome means you get to take over there planet every server has one alien planet above and we have to get it using crafted vehicles out of supplies in the store you have to work to get the supplies or join the military to get supplies on raids which you can then put in your shop to support your team and cost whatever you want for it but the commander can decide if it’s too high so now you know it’s a survival base game where you have to make a community with random people or friends and you have to do a war and your goal is to not die in the afterlife and turn into a shadow demon Also I think you should be able to revive The enemy team with medicine at the store now they’re not allowed to fight you if they’re on the enemy team but you can revive your own team to keep them alive and stop the zombie apocalypse
numgdo,I have decide what I'm going to make don't keep your expectations to high though," \n\nIt's a fairly simple idea. You're an outlaw on the loo, shooting law enforcement as they come at you in droves.\n\nThere's a quick opening scene as you leave the pub, pass a Wanted poster with your face on it, and enter the outhouse. You hear a whispered commotion outside, and hear the first blast, making you duck down. They shoot the hell out of the outhouse, leaving a line open right in the middle of it from bullet holes, just passing over you. You grab your guns, uncrouch, and the game begins.\n\nThe actual game is basically you target shooting the posse before they shoot you. You can only see ahead of you, and to the sides, though the gap they made when they first started firing."
num2n4,States of sin,"This is going to be  long post \n\nIdeally playable on PC and gaming consoles \n\nBackground/setting : in world similar to 1920s and 30s north America  specifically the United States. Starting point Newark New Jersey to Galveston Texas. The most similar to the actual United States due to the fact that in this reality all the different regions of the United States are their own separate Nations so New England for examples is it own country. \n\n\nAesthetics: Noir, 30s animated cartoons and Victorian / Gilded Age\n\nStates of sin is a classically styled 2D action adventure with  puzzle  solve and   detective work across a vast interconnected world similar to hollow knight, pinstripe and cup heads  for mechanics.\n\n\nIn the game you play a detective that has that just graduated from the academy. The game is not truly linear but with the different cases you take you can form your own stories  for the detective. You decide certain traits personality quirks for your detective. These different quirks and traits determined the different dialogue options you have with NPCs. You have certain steps such as speed,stamina and mana etc. To expand the map you have to continuously beat different locations that you're in for example if you have five cases of salt that will unlock more pathway to go. The player has the has the ability to where never their choices take them. The best way to unlock different regions in different nations through missions and investigations. Overtime you prove your skill and reputation as a detective. The detective does have magic and they only have Shadow,water, ice, fire, Moon, psychic and  wind Magic. They all have their own different skill trees and you can put experience points to upgrade your skills. You can also gain gadgets and different weapons from markets or the underground criminal world. There's money hidden passageways , Alleyways and etc  where you can go get information for a case. They are mini games like baseball or solitaire. most of the villains are based on problems that were occurring during the 1920s and 30s. And certain events will be occurring at the same time you are playing the game roaming around for example the Harlem Renaissance will be occurring in New York City while you were still trying to solve a murder. Can you to stop by and visit and participate in these these events and talk to people were there and people that weren't there. Does many places where you can rest and interact with people for example diners and General stores. The player can interact with certain objects like coffee to drink it. The player can also collect badges that can be used for Buffs and boost to certain abilities and certain stats. Overtime deflator forms a big map with the different locations they've been in. Detective can always go back to the main police station that they always in or the police station of the local area the store evidence and analyze it. The player does have a home base or a home in Newark that can be customized by the player. The player can befriend certain NPCS to become like informants or Allies for example Josh from the bar can give you new information about certain things that are happening. You can get an animal companion like a dog to help you in combat and sniff out Clues. There is a detective mode where the player goes into the gray. When  playing through flashbacks the area goes into black and white. There is a day and night cycle and a  calendar. I will say it's somewhat similar to Dark Souls difficulty but not quite too difficult.\n\nThe main ideas that multiple players can play the same game but have different endings or different ways of making a story for example one person can be an honorable cop trying to help their city or someone can be a corrupt cop doing dirty work for the mafia.  \n\nI do have ideas for future DLC for example I would like go to the U.K or Germany."
num0sp,1v1 2v2 or 5v5 Sniper game,"Did you ever watched a movie or anime where there is two snipers battling each other, but like, waiting in position, trying to not show your location, using mirrors and decoys, until one finds another and one shot ends the battle, i have a ideia of a game like that, where outsmarting your opponent is the key to vicotry, i was think the game to be in a ww1 or ww2 setup maybe even before ww1. There could be city maps, where you need to use verticallity, snow maps and etc, what do you guys think? in 2v2 or 5v5 team communication but using in games comunnication tools, and other shennanigans like battling the cold not using scope to now show reflex, i don't know"
nulubv,Rescue the princess from the dragon's castle,"So I'm fleshing out an idea I had with the player playing as a knight rescuing a princess from a castle that is guarded by a dragon (think Shrek, lol). I was thinking randomized castle layout, find the princess and get out in a 5-10 minute ""run"". \n\nThen I got a bit stuck on what the combat or gameplay would actually look like. I was thinking melee combat, but as the dragon would be the main (and only?) enemy, is it a little boring? Evading the dragons attack might not be the most interesting gameplay. \n\nAny ideas on what enemies, objectives or other things I could add to spice up this kind of game? \n\nFor reference I am seeing this as a 2D top down game. Only melee combat top down i could think of at the moment is Gauntlet, from around 2014 or something."
nul66e,cat maker/breeding game with realistic genetics,"it would be like one of those doll maker games on dolldivine, except you make two cats with realistic coat colors and patterns, and then you click a button to generate a number of possible offspring. i found this [kitten generator](https://perchance.org/kitten-generator) that is pretty close to what i imagined, except it obviously doesnt have any images\n\nif anyone does want to make this hmu because i can do all of the art and help with genetics"
nul0rh,Alaskan trail, The game is about exploration and traveling is based on the migration to Alaska and the Alaskan goldrush. player or players survive all the rough Terrain and make to alaska with out a modern map. So in game they are going use technology of that time to navigate their way to Alaska. That is only the first  half the other half is the gold rush where the players have to  find and mine gold to become rich. This game has a online services or private services. What happens in the game  is alternate history for Alaskan region. So is the players make a decision on their own since this game is free decisions basically whatever you do has effect on your server for later. So make a town where there is no town in reality for example. The game ends at 1950's  for the timeline and player is does have to stay in that time period they can go back to different decades. You can say similar to sent you cuz you can't make a family and it's the players original play character dies you just become the oldest offspring of the character. It mainly rpg base and you have to build a life you want.
nujxv4,A rarely used multi-player idea,"I have recently started to get into multi-player games. Most commonly Smite. I used to play Battle Royales though like Warzone and used to play some Fortnite. One problem: I suck. I want to improve but I find it difficult to be motivated to improve if I'm just going to get stomped in every match. Something Smite does that I like very much is being able to do sample matches with bots. A lot of multi-player games, especially BRs, have a complex meta and I like the idea of being able to get a hang of things and enjoy a full match without the pressure of doing good. I know a lot feature a consensed ""training"" mode to give the basics, but it's not the same as a full match. Destroying Bots after a long stressful day fees good too."
nu9p7s,Dinosaur Survival Game Idea," So basically, i saw Womble's video and got filled with inspiration, despite not being a game dev, nor having any interest in it, but like, this idea has been bugging me for a very long while and i don't know what to do with it. So have fun with this basic idea and outline.\n\n So essentially, imagine the isle and beasts of Bermuda had a child, this game would be it. It draws on both games but also uses them in a new way using a more developed and probably lag inducing system then Bermuda and honestly just stealing the isle in it's entirety because let's face it, dinosaur survival games live and die by it.\n\n So to begin with, the map is very important, infact it is THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THE GAME, fuck dino's and balancing, you can have Overwatch level of balancing for all i care, but this map has to be in this general outline for this game to work in the way it does, if this map is not done to this outline then the systems are not gonna work. I will explain this after outlining the two most important mechanics to the game.\n\n So to begin with, mechanic one: Time, time is an important part of the game, and not as in cool mechanic where you go through time in order to have sex with your grandma riding a dinosaur when she's a teenager, time is important as in it helps define the second mechanic weather. This game, needs an internal clock, more of an internal calendar, it needs to count however many days have passed and react appropriately, why? Because we're gonna rip off beasts of Bermuda really hard here in order to make this game.\n\n Beasts of Bermuda has an interesting weather mechanic where it floods and the water dinos go onto land and attacks the land dinos, very cool. If only Bermuda didn't run like it was an ARK mod (No offense to Bermuda lovers) i thought this is a cool idea, let's make it more interesting. \n\n To build on weather you're gonna need a map that looks something like this Biome wise: You need a deep sea, a shore/reef section, then the beach, then the swamp, then the jungle and then the mountains. Why? Because rivers come from mountains and dino's drink river water, they can't drink sea water, this is important.\n\nAlso important to note, in all of these levels a plethora of AI live in these environment, special dino's the players can't play as, this is also very important to the mechanics of the game.\n\n So let's imagine a perfect day, it is spring or autumn, it rains a bit but not too much and everything is fine, the forests and jungles are well stocked, beasts are about but too much as per what Soviet Womble said. Players are happy and chill, so let's see what the players are doing.\n\n To begin with Soviet's twist B, adult carnivore players have to eat Herbivorous and weaker carnivore players to live. Cool, but like Bermuda we have sea beasts, the open ocean isn't exactly comforting to live by and you can't hide unless you're really good, players of the same species don't tend to eat each other so we'd need more of different aquatic species to make it interesting, where do the poor baby Mosasaurs and others go?\n\n Well, that's where the Reef comes in, Juvenile and baby animals can go in there to hide from adults who can't follow them, great! But if we let them just camp it sorta forces essentially fight club in the sea against giant elders, so we need the babies to move, this is a simple fix. Out in the deep sea, there are large schools of fish moving about, being dumbasses and bait, like five schools at most just roaming about and they are perfect for the babies, infact perfect for any carnivore that can reach them. The reef does have animals to eat, but a single deep sea fish makes these reef fish look like burnt toast, so the babies now have to go out to sea to eat these fish, which move a lot and so it creates a system where babies can't camp.\n\n But there's a second issue, the shallow waters allow for piscivorous predators to eat your ass, you don't want that, the reefs hold their own predator of which i am not versed enough to say what it is, but it can also absolutely pwn you. So what do you do? You go to the swamp, find a mangrove or other tree if Mangroves are too recent and you hunker down, forcing you inland and making you interact with more players. Alternatively you could hide in the rockpools, absolute protection against everything, but keep mind of the tide as it leaves you trapped there and very easy to catch.\n\nSo that's the interactive player system for your marine life, as babies they live on the shore and reefs where they are easy to catch, either going out to get valuable prey in the deep sea to risk being with adults, or going further inland to hide in Swamps.\n\n What about the adult marine life? They seem to live almost entirely on a different server, where their only interaction is with other marine life, well this is a problem, we shouldn't isolate players, so this is the fix. There is one main river, running down the map, one massive, massive river, this will come into play later, here the marine predators can go in and fuck about with their friends in this one river and few tributaries, not a lot but who expects to go on a grassland chase as the prehistoric equivalent of a whale. Also similar to rock pools, at certain times of days great big fuck off lagoons flood with water which some of the smaller to medium sized adults can hang out in, just keep the tide in mind again.\n\nNow that is the marine life, the land or terrestrial life is essentially just dino simulator or really just the isle, but we have a another theatre to attend to. The heavens.\n\n Yep, time to be a bird, now playing as a bird, i noticed, makes you more part of it the sky isn't really a theatre, it's just uh, land but higher if that makes sense, let's fix that. To begin with, the bird dino's ought to live in higher places, so special roosts should be made on rainforests and mountains for them to rest, away from a giant T-rex. The trees will be closer to the actual prey animals you want, a new type of tree climbers and bugs for smaller birds, as bigger birds just eat you, but big old long neck bois out here really just be destroying them by going on an evening stroll, making the mountains the most secure area to hide in and also probably like a special bonus like being born here makes you grow faster or something.\n\n As you can see, a common theme is to make players want to go places.\n\n Now we'd also need to consider sea birds, who have to take the plunge to get those epic schools of fish that even some semi-aquatic dino's might want to swim to, for this it'd be pretty simple, just some big old rocks will do.\n\nAnyways there's not much you can do for sky unfortunately, apart from forcing them to hang about on the mountains and dive bomb their pray like a kamikaze pilot heading their way to America high on acid.\n\nNow we give a brief honorable mention to the underground, which from the isle we will have some burrows, to balance this, snakes. Enough said. It won't matter when we discuss what's about to go down now.\n\nNow to discuss the Calendar, you see that Calendar isn't there to keep track of time for players, it's there to record seasons and day length. making the AI take away or add a month at random to the season you will start to see a change, let's do the days first then we go on to the season.\n\n From Spring we get pretty meh days of somewhat equal length, almost never 50/50 but close to day length,  then we go to Summer which is essentially paradise minus the weather, long days, short nights, the grasslands grow happily, Herbivores will be happy guy meme, Carnivores will be unhappy guy meme. Now it's autumn, it's growing chiller and the nights are getting longer, it's back at the 50/50 range and everyone is chilling, now it's winter, the nights are long and terrifying, carnivores roam the night and this forces herbivores to run into trees like the scardey cats they are. Then it repeats.\n\n Here we can see some basic examples of how even time change can really fuck with the way people play and what land is available. Here comes the most important part though, the weather change, and it's more then you think.\n\n To preface this, i live in a rainforest, i grow food in the rainforest and rely off my local river in the rainforest, i know how the seasons effect the rainforest and I am very biased in my like for seasons based on this. None of my friends understand this because none of them have to live off a river for money (I drink rain water, another reason I'm biased) but I definitely do.\n\n Let's start with the worse season, Winter, Fuck Winter, you think it's gonna be snowy paradise? Wrong, it doesn't snow in the rainforest, it snows in the forest and the mountains, it makes the mountains essentially uninhabitable, everyone has gone south. This forces northern players to go south as well and introduces a new playstyle not to mention what happens next.\n\n Fun fact: Drought happens in Winter, the droughts in this game range from annoying cold and migration into forest and Jungle, to all the northern rivers are dry, go to the swamps and beaches or else you will die. \n\n Yep, the northern rivers are dead, mot others are lowered, the only one that is mostly ok is the main river and the southern river/swamp since they've got a hotline from the ocean, it means the southern water however is not very to drink for one, meaning dinos will have to be here a lot and interact with each other and two big dinos can't enter anymore. Now already with AI they've come from the mountains to fuck with you, so cool mountain fish and stuff are hanging out down here it also means mountain predators are here, that can kick your ass in the swamp and reefs so you got to go out to the deep end for a while, forcing the players to interact in an immersive way.\n\n Winter can last from very short, to OMG please help every single water source has been dried up and now the giant crocodiles live in the reef! So yeah very extreme change, brought on day by day by this AI.\n\n This drought can last into spring, it can last into Summer if you're unlucky enough, this is based off the time my family completely ran out of water because the rain didn't return for six months, it wasn't fun.\n\n Now the seasons are shifting back and it's become summer, Spring is just the medial period, you get a bonus for being born here or something, more food i guess to reward players for surviving, you know, just a return to normal. Now comes the rainy season.\n\n Yep it's gonna rain a bunch, flood plains gonna begin to flood and the rivers are gonna revive and even swell with water. life is good for herbivore as food is out and everyone returns to their environment.\n\n Except for birds, due to constant rain and storm the canopy nests are unavailable and they will have to go to the mountains.\n\n  now comes the summer event. depending on a coin flip, one of two things will happen, either a Cyclone with hit or a tsunami will hit. if it is a Cyclone you will want to run for cover, it is gonna flood pretty badly so stay on medium ground like hills and the mountains, some small plants are gonna go and depending on severity trees are, a Hurricane is a lot like a tornado, it will roam until about the jungle before dying into severe storm, this will be, hard to implement but you know, so is all of this probably.\n\n Of course during the extreme floods, baby-medium marine life can go into flood plains and into the jungle to scavenge and hunt trapped land animals, while the giant marine animals can now enter the swamp and beaches to hunt them, thus the circle of life continues. It also removes burrowers from their holes, forcing them to go onto higher ground or drown.\n\n Of course everyone will now be up in the forests and mountains, introducing new prey and predator relations as rocky outcrops force the predators to stay in the forest and allow for small nimble prey up there it will allow the birds some more action and threats to their nests on the mountains. A hurricane can last up to like three weeks and will be gone, the land will repair from the destruction and the flooding will just continue for like a month.\n\n Now comes the tsunami, much rarer then usual, mostly because it effects pretty much everyone negatively unless you live in the mountains. to begin with, the Tsnuami will drain the water from the beach, reef and rock pool so any fish stuck in that has a very slim chance of suffocation and probably will get eaten by that one oblivious player. Or maybe he's just a chad knowing that if he sees this and can eat a fish, he's probably just going to die.\n\n Now tsunami's, they spawn in the ocean, anyone caught in the ocean whether you be a mosasaur or just a school of fish is going to abducted much like a child at persona five convention, and congrats, you're gonna be on land now, good luck.\n\n That's right, you're about to be thrown onto land harder then you pelting a can and saying yeet because you're a redditor and you only find five things funny depending on what dank memes says, this is also true for everyone up to the jungle, now unless you're on the shore and that wave hits you like a piano joke from a cartoon, you're not dead yet. \n\n At first of course you will be swimming, injured probably and also probably drowning, those very confused and scared marine predators will probably try to eat you because pretty much everything right now is fair game, or maybe just too dazed or confused to do anything. Anyways, now everyone and their mum is going to the mountains, issue: The rivers that separate the mountains and forest are flash flooding during these events, trapping you essentially in the event area, i will of course discuss this later.\n\n Anyways, the max waves are three, the most severe waves will hit into the forest  and the most mild will only reach the beginning of the jungle.\n\n In these events i wanted to stress moving about as a seasonal thing, so we don't just get people all clumped together like in other maps, slowly forcing the players in most of the events accept for the tsunami.\n\n  Now one last issue with this, to get players to not camp the mountains during the summer, the mountains probably won't get a lot of love from players, unless you're a flyer for most of the year, but moving to the mountains effectively dodges all forms of flooding. To fix this i propose the following solutions:\n\n Make the Mountains Risky: Giants like the T-Rex's shouldn't just make it their stomping grounds, making a loose gravel patch or something that activates when megafauna spawns on them, causing them to slip and fall, which could lead to their death, don't spam it but definitely place it.\n\n Lightning: Where i live we can't get struck by lightning because the mountains always take the hit, do the same, make the mountains a lightning hotspot and strike it a bunch during summer so players are more careful and go to the forest where the event can actually happen.\n\n The Moat: I mentioned this previously but have a few rivers flash flood, taking a lot of debris with them, making the rivers dangerous to cross so the players will have to take the choice between the horrific weather or the dangerous flood waters.\n\n Landslides: have Landslides appear, bringing debris down on players killing them, perhaps avalanches in winter.\n\nI understand to get all these systems working in a multiplayer may be hard, i don't know anything about game development, but if you have anymore suggestions or otherwise feel free to comment them and we can discuss it!."
nu8k9l,A game set I the Enter the Gungeon universe where you play as the Resourceful Rat,Ok if you don't know what Enter the Gungeon is go read up on it before reading this post don't blame me for spoilers btw YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED\n\nThe game would obviously take place in the Gungeon with the player character being the Rat you could go to different floors to get materiels for upgrades for your gear like your Kunai\n\nStory: Instead of having no regrets the rat would instead be trying to steal and/or craft The Bullet That Can Kill The Past in an attempt to save your family from starvation and to rule the Gungeon with them as fate had planned to bring the Rat here already\n\nGameplay loop: the general loop would involve killing bosses from Enter the Gungeon every once in a while to get a part of the Bullet That Can Kill The Past along the way improving your gear and looting chests to use certain guns and killing certain enemies for parts to improve said gear after the bullet is constructed your final goal would be to Kill The High Dragun to access the Time Veil to get The Gun That Can Kill The Past\n\nEnding: I have planned two endings \n\nEnding 1. The good ending is the ending where you prevent the death of your family and rule the Gungeon with your Rat brothers and sisters\n\nEnding 2. The bad ending is when instead of killing the past you instead go to Bullet Hell to confront the Lich master of the Gungeon and Ruler of all contained within upon killing the Lich the Rat overtaken by his pride and greed and becomes something worse than the Lich turning the Gungeon into his paradise where he tortures all who enter looking to kill there pasts\n\nThere isn't much more I have for this game idea  it I hope she me people found it interesting
nu6ohy,BO3 Uplink Style MOBA,"\nThis is teamwork oriented MOBA, based on the COD: BO3 Uplink multiplayer mode. 5-10 players would try to get the ball to the opposing teams goal. This would be done by catching the ball and passing it to other teammates. You would traverse the asymmetrical map using fluent movement like wall running, air dashing and maybe jetpack-style boosting. \nThe ball would be physics based, and would harm the player holding it, to encourage passing and teamwork. \n\nYou would play as a champion/hero/character out of a selection of characters, each with their own weapons(WIP), passive and motor abilities and intended play styles. These would have a cool down. The player could throw the ball with various amounts of power, depending on how long the player held the shoot button for, allowing for freestyle and skilful play.\n\nThe map layout would be quite linear, allowing the player to master a certain approach, without having to memorise each map and it’s layout. The maps would basically be the same but reskinned. (Variety in the map layouts is still an option)"
nu6lzz,A Colony Sim Where You Manage A Colony Of Ants,"I’ve had this idea in my head for some time now.\n\nBasically think Oxygen Not Included but with many ants. You’d start off with maybe 10 ants, 9M, 1F and these would mine resources, build buildings and infrastructure and stuff like that. These could mate to create more ants with chances to get twins, triplets or more in the eggs.\n\nNow, each ant would have a set of stats eg Speed, Strength, Fortitude, Mining Efficiency, Storage Capability, Intelligence etc that have a small chance to mutate upon birth, increasing the max potential that specific stat has. \n\nAnts will work best using a grouping system, where you assign groups of maybe 5-10 ants to do a task based on their stats. So group a set of mutated ants based on their increased mining stat would be very efficient and cool. I’d like it to be similar to Pokemon in the depth of each ant with the potential for hundreds of ants to be in someone’s colony.\n\nThe world would work similar to Terraria but not with pixel art. I’d love for there to be liquids like water and oil to add electricity and other cool opportunities for the player.\n\nWhat do you think?"

o6du3a,Unique Ideas for a City/Town Builder,"Hello!\n\nTo start I didn't mean to make the post this long so sorry. \n\nI've started creating 3d assets for a stylized medieval city builder/management game but I'm stuck in a rut on how to make it unique. My friends have been less than helpful as normal so I'm hoping some of you may have some ideas.\n\nSo as a quick stepping stone Banished has been sort of the basis of my inspiration though I have no plans to be as in depth. Instead I want to add some other secondary aspect. Initially I considered adding RTS or tower defense mechanics but that's been heavily used. I considered having the town become slowly infested by vampires but not sure how I would handle that mechanically in a fun way. Lastly, the one I've been tossing around a bit more, is to add a choose your own adventure style theme over top of it all. \n\nThe actual town management part of the game is what you as the player would directly control. Throughout playing random scenarios would pop up that you as the person in charge has to make decisions on. To try to differentiate a little from other games doing something similar I want multiple outcomes to occur and one scenario could end after a choice or two or go on for much longer with the idea to make every game different. Obviously it would require a lot of writing and an equal amount of programming to make choices have impact but that's something I'm fine with.\n\nSo in short, how does this sound and does anyone have other ideas?"
o6dim7,"Fantasy, Action, Adventure, Vampire game- ""Phyria""","An open-world, online, fantasy, action, adventure game. Play as a human, vampire, or a mix of both; a 'Dhampir.' The game would be online, meaning you'd need some form of internet connection because playing with other people from around the world would be a default setting.\n\n**GAME MECHANICS PT.1:**                                                                                                                                                                         You'd start off with 3 save files. When starting a new save file, you'd have a random chance to be either male or female. Then you have a chance to be a human, vampire, or Dhampir. You will also have a chance to be of the commonwealth, nobility, royalty, vampire hunter clan. There will also be a chance whether you are born with magic or not(female **humans** have a higher chance of being born with magic).\n\n**LORE**: \*\*\*Note: there will be 3 seasons in the game, each season will have different lore that relates to each other.\*                                                                                                                                                                              S1: You are in a world where the **Vampire King**, Dracula, is terrorizing the world. You feel the need to put an end to the disorder and madness by slaying Dracula, but it is not as easy as you think. You need to overcome Dracula's army as he destroys villages, towns, and cities, night by night; while also uncovering hidden secrets, artifacts, and more from the past. Or, you could play as a vampire, who is trying to help Dracula and stop the humans and dhampirs from stopping Dracula; while also achieving historical artifacts from vampire history. \n\nS2: After defeating Dracula and his army, you'd think everything would go back to normal... right? News about Dracula's defeat spread like a wildfire, there were varied emotions; not for this person though. This person had been waiting for Dracula's death for hundreds of years, and now that he is gone, her plans will start to take motion.  This person, or **Empress**, is named Elizabeth; and she has plans for world domination. She plans to domesticate humans like livestock, whilst ruling the entire world like a queen. You and your friends need to stop Elizabeth and her sisters from conquering the world. Or try to assist Elizabeth with her world-conquering, and stop the heroes from defeating Elizabeth. \n\nS3: Now that you have defeated Dracula, and Elizabeth, along with Elizabeth's sisters, you'd think that things can finally come to a peaceful ending... right? If you could be more wrong. There are people trying to bring back Dracula from the depths of hell, others trying to replicate what Elizabeth was trying to do, and a strange old man that would do anything to gain access and control a strange thing called ""**The Fourth Dimension.""** Never mind him, the physical representation of **DEATH** is trying to bring about the end of the world?! You and your friends are on a journey to stop people from bringing back Dracula, dominating the world, and stop **DEATH** from destroying the world....can you make a final stand? Although, your final battles never seem to be final battles. Or you could assist **DEATH** with his mass genocidal plans.    \n\n**HUMANS**:                                                                                                                                                                                          As you know, you can be a female human or a male human. Let us talk about each gender; strengths, and weaknesses.\n\nStrengths: Humans can wield blessed items, armor, and weapons. Blessed items do more damage to Vampires or Demons.\n\nWeaknesses: Humans have a slow regeneration speed, so they will bleed longer if they have an open wound, and they are more vulnerable to broken limbs during battle. Broken limbs can make you slower, do less damage, miss more attacks, it all depends on the area broken.\n\n*Female:* I might seem sexist for this, but as a female, you are weaker than a male in terms of physical strength, but you are stronger than a male in terms of magical strength. As a female, you have a small chance of being born more masculine than feminine, so your physical strength is the same as a male. Females also have a little more agility than men, so they can run a little faster and make sharper movements: jumping through holes on walls, and dodging attacks. As a female you are also a little bit smarter than a man, meaning your Intelligence stat is 1.2% higher(I will go into detail about intelligence later on). And as a female human, you have the chance of being born with the rare ability to grant buffs for your allies such as healing, speed boosts, strength boosts, etc.\n\n*Male:* As a male, your physical strength is better than a female's, but your magical strength is much worse. You also have a little less agility, so dodging attacks would be a little harder. As a man, you can train in magical strength, but you will need to sacrifice your physical strength heavily, making you weaker than a regular female in terms of physical strength.  As a male, you also have a chance to be born with the rare ability called ""Slayer's Will"" where you get an insane boost in any stat that has over 45 points in it, along with a health boost, and an extra 20 damage points to any attack.\n\n**VAMPIRES:** Vampires can be male or female. Let's talk about their weaknesses, strengths, and gender strengths, and weaknesses.\n\nStrengths: Vampires are much faster, stronger, and more agile than humans. They heal wounds and broken bones faster than humans. Basically a better human. Vampires are also a little bit more intelligent than humans.\n\nWeaknesses: The sun. Vampires start to burn if any part of them is exposed to sunlight. That can make them extremely vulnerable during the daytime. And blessed items. Blessed items are items that are blessed by an angel. Blessed items do more damage to anything that is demonic or vampiric. Another weakness to note would be that they need to drink human blood or eat human flesh to survive. Being a starved vampire will make you weaker and cause you to lose control of your character, putting your character into an NPC like state; where the NPC that you need to kill and eat 2 humans before you regain control over your avatar( Note: As a vampire eating humans does not apply to eating only real players, you can eat human NPCs).\n\nFemale: Female vampires would have a higher magical strength than female humans and male vampires, but would be unable to utilize the magic to manipulate the elements or life. Vampiric magic would include control over hell flame and enhancing your strength, speed, durability. Female vampires would also be stronger than human men, but weaker than vampire men. Females would also be extremely agile.\n\nMale: Male vampires would have much lower magic strength than a human male, but would be stronger than a human male in terms of physical strength. Vampire men would be way tougher than human men, meaning they can take would that would usually inflict a bleeding effect on the victim without bleeding. They'd also be just as fast as female vampires. Vampire males would have a little less intelligence than human males.\n\n**DHAMPIR:** Dhampirs are a name used to describe someone who is 1/2 human and 1/2 vampire. A dhampir has almost all of the buffs that come with being a vampire, with little to none of the weaknesses.\n\nStrengths: Since dhampirs are part human, not only are they immune to the sunlight, they can wield blessed weapons, and can use a wider variety of magic. They can use all of the magic humans can use, and all of the magic vampires can use; not to mention wielding blessed items. They also keep all of the strengths of being a vampire. Dhampirs are also the smartest of the races, due to having experienced the life of a vampire and the life of a human.\n\nWeaknesses: The only weakness that a dhampir has is the impulse to eat or drink a human's blood or flesh once every 24hrs. Yup, that is the only weakness.\n\nFemales: Female dhampirs have the combined magical strength of a female vampire and a female human; making them a very good option for a magical build. Although a female dhampir has the same strength as a human male. Female dhampirs also have incredible speed and agility, along with supreme intelligence.\n\nMales: Male dhampirs have a combined strength of 3.5/4 vampire male strength and the full strength of a male human. They also have the same magical strength as a human female. Male dhampirs are just as smart as female dhampirs, and they are just as agile and speedy as female dhampirs.\n\n**GAME MECHANICS PT.2:**                                                                                                                                                                 In this section, I will cover the different states, and what each is useful for, skills, magical spells, etc.\n\nSTATS:\n\nSorcery: This stat would increase the damage, accuracy, and potency of your magical skills.\n\nStrength: This stat would affect your physical damage, toughness(toughness refers to how many hits you can take without bleeding or getting knocked out. It would also enable you to wear heavy armor and not fall down with it. \n\nIntelligence: This would enable you to learn or teach yourself new skills: Weapon skills, Sorcery skills, Martial combat skills, etc.. Intelligence could also increase your odds of thinking up a strategy during battle. Strategies are things that happen not so often, but what they do is kinda help you with the battle; for 1 minute the game will give you tips on how to evade, attack, and defend yourself from opponents. \n\nAgility: This stat would increase your speed and mobility. Have good speed would allow you to close the distance between you and your opponent, and agility would basically be your skill with evading attacks and etc...\n\n(VAMPIRE EXCLUSIVE) Vampirism: This stat will give the vampire access to abilities such as freezing your opponents into ice and smashing them, breaking your body down into little bats that fly away to give you much more mobility, manipulation of hell fire, turning your body into mist, and so much more.\n\n(Thanks for using your valuable time to look at my post! &lt;3)\n\n(And also if you really want to make a game like this, please contact me via discord, because i have so much more planned for this game if it were created).\n\n(Discord acc:  Jessica #2347)"
o6dhyh,Commandos-like game with ScienceFiction Setting and no SaveOption for missions,"You remember Stealth games like Commandos or Desperados?\n\nA game like this, but in a science fiction world where you must finish 20-30 different missions. Big difference: You cannot save during playing a mission, if you die you must restart the mission...that will make it frustrating but also very satisfying once you complete it after the 100th try...like the bosses in Souls-Games."
o6961n,Arcade racing simulator that is literally a simulation.,"When you enter the game, you see the open world map loading in in some cool sci-fi way. There's no real drivers in the car. Crashes are hyper realistic and when the crash is at it's end, the car will teleport back to the place where the crash starts also with some cool animation. The map is full of different terrains and biomes to explore. There are (non licensed) cars for every situation. Drag racing, street racing, destruction races, stunt races, off road races, you name it! You'll also be able to customize your cars with paint jobs, spoilers, tires, boosts and much more. You get new cars and items by winning races and challenges. For instance: you win a bunch of drag races, you get drag race cars and items. You can play offline, but it'll also have full online compatibility. So you can do challenges with people all over the world, and even play campaign mode with others in the same game. It's all kinda like burnout paradise, but bigger. Better graphics, better physics, more variety in challenges, more diverse map, more customization etc."

o6627n,First person non euclidean phone game with 360 degree vision via gemetric pixel fisheye lens.,"      I've had a game hyperrogue for a while. I have been insanely inspired by it and I'm hoping my ramblings at least inspire a new idea similar to what I'm thinking. It's a top down rogue like. It's hard for me to explain it well so I recommend looking for a video or downloading it, but I'll still try my best. Everything you see is a hexagon unit that's either floor, wall, money, or enemies. These colored dots essentially move across your screen in strange ways that makes It hard to circle back to a familiar area. Each level has its different shaped floors and walls and different patterns. \n          Why am I talking about an existing game? The abstract style of the graphics as well as the complex geometry at play there. But the idea is a bit different. See, that game has a very basic system of run around for ten colored dots that change in appearance for each world you walk into. There are different enemies or plants in one world that grow out to you, but the minimalistic pleasing colors and patterns that act as a screen to see it on.\n      There's a first person mode in hyperrogue but its kinda sloppy and hard to use. The premise would be 2d graphics. Procedural generation or at some tricky coding I guess. Something similar to that old windows Screensaver that moves through hallways and corners, but it's like a Picasso painting where all the details are there at the same time. Like all the pixel units fill the circle. Your vision of the surroundings are a fisheye lens so you see 360 degrees."

o5yvp5,Walker vs Infantry Game,"Giant mech games have been missing an important part of the draw of Giant mechs, stomping on people without giant mechs. So here is what I propose:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA Squad based FPS where the player plays as the commander and main fire support unit in an ATST/ Warhound Titan scale (10 meter tall) mech. The player will command 3 squads of infantry which will screen the mech from close range anti mech weapons and act as spotters for indirect fire weapons.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe rest is sort of a novelized example of how I envision game play to work:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe player lopes through open countryside in their mech to reach a small town that has been giving the infantry trouble. The mech comes to a stop behind a hill and deploys A, B and C squads then rises to its full height to get a good look at the town. Heat signatures in 3 of the windows and the top of the church tower signify potential ambushers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe player obliterates the church tower with a single HE round and starts peppering the buildings with the heat signatures with heavy machine gun fire. He then gives the order to squads A and B to move up to a section of wall to the left of main street. Squad C is ordered into a crumpled building to the right of mains street. When the squads arrive the player moves his mech down the street. Squad C reports that they see a long barrel polking out of a building two blocks down. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot taking any risks the player launches a CCTV guided missile into the air. The camera feed has a highlighted spot where Squad C suspects there is an anti tank gun. They were correct as the missile closes on the target the player gets a brief view of a tank, hull down, in the wreckage of a bakery. Crump! The missile hits and the building collapses on the would-be ambusher.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSquad B is ordered to advance down main street while squad A takes the back alleys. The player advances behind Squad A. Gun fire erupts from some buildings opposite to the bakery. Squad B is forced back with some casualties but the player's mech strides forward dispensing payback with its heavy machine guns.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSquad C spots an RPG on the roof of and takes it out before it can shoot the player. The player levels the building with the mech's main cannon just to be sure. There are too many buildings to flatten this way, but fortunately Squad A has moved up behind the ambush and shot them all in the back while the player was being noisy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSquad C moves up while Squad B brings its casualties back to the mech for treatment. Squad C encounters some hold outs with some satchel charges, they too are put down before they can become a threat.   \n\n\nThe road ahead splits left and right. There is a good defensive position at the right fork and the player orders Squad A to occupy it while squads B and C leapfrog each other down the right fork as you walk up the middle. half way down Squad A reports contact with more armored elements. The player orders them to hold fire and makes a quick turn down a side street. All squads are told to hold fire as the player sends up one CCTV guided missiles after another. Three tanks from the armored element are reduced to slag before the missiles run out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSquad C has the best shot at the surviving armored elements and the player gives them permission to fire. Tracers lash back and forth between the squad and the enemy support troops. One of the tanks gets clear of its mangled brothers and starts shelling squad C's position. The player tells Squad C to relocate further back as the enemy tanks push forward.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll this time the player has been slinking forward with only Squad B covering him. Squad A has been feeding target positions to the player from their concealed location further back down the street. The player orders squad B to a decent firing position then surges forward into the flank of the enemy column. The main cannon roars and Squad A and B are given permission to let loose.   \n\n\nHit from two sides, neither of which was the focus of its assault, the armored column falters and dies. Too late the support infantry realize that Squad A had cut off its line of retreat and their rifles do as much of the clean up work as the player's heavy Machine gun.   \n\n\nThe main resistance broken, the squads have an easy time clearing out the rest of the town, only calling on the player's heavy guns two more times to deal with pockets of resistance."

o5x3tr,A game about exploring a mentally ill persons mind,I have had an idea for a game where you play as a doctor who works with a new form of treatment where they physically upload their consciousness into your brain and explore the world inside you mind\n\nOn his first day on the job a seemingly normal if slightly shy young adult comes in asking to be cured. The game takes place as you travel the different parts of the patient’s mind.\n\nIt would take the form of an RPG whereby you collect different positive aspects of the patients personality and use them to battle negative ones (and even late turn the negatives into positives after beating them)\n\nA lot of the humour would come with the different aspects acting so wildly differently and interacting with eachother but I also want it to be a humble and emotional experience by the end
o5wyk8,Medieval style survival,"I've had this idea for a game recently of an immersive multiplayer game where, like it the medieval ages, can make kingdoms, alliances and stuff, kinda like ark survival evolved, except with defence and sieging mechanics. Tribes can build their kingdoms, make alliances with other kingdoms or just go at war. Sieging would use weapons such as trebuchets and catapults in order to attack, and other means of attacking like siege towers and rams and ect. Defenders can have a list of defence tools also like couldrens over the main gate. Combat could be like chivelry style or simular in ways to for honor, strategic and skill based. It would also have reasons to use these siege weapons and really use what's best to attack the kingdom the other player have made. Also would make it so kingdoms can be taken over, rather then just always getting completely destroyed, in order to make attackers use their high power weapons wisely as they would have to repair the damages after taking it over. Siege weapons would have to be made on site, building each part of them one at a time. This would help the defenders see and prepare to get attacked rather then just getting wiped out of nowhere. I know it would be hard balancing a game like this but I would love to see a game like this some time, I also am aware that the idea is very vague in the way that I call it a ""survival game"", but I'd like to think of it like ark survival evolved, where you build up your kingdom bigger and stronger as you go further into the game, make a tribe and maybe recruit and train ai as archers, farmers, swordsmen or whatever you need doing in your kingdom, this could also make it so that you get more income the more ai villagers you have in your kingdom as they pay you for land and housing. Just a rough idea I felt like sharing. Any questions just let me know :)"

o5kt05,Fantasy open battle with neat vharacter creation integration.,"Preface: \nAlways wanted to make games but coding, logic and, the technical side aren't my thing. My life also isn't at the point where I could try putting a team together. So, I want to share some of my dreams in the hope that they might spark something in someone. With that out of the way, let's begin.\n\n\nGenre: \nOpen field (I.e. Battlefield or the OG SW Battlefronts) + hack and slash.\n\nSetting: \nLate Medieval/early renaissance fantasy.\n\nStyle: \nA simple painterly style (think FF Tactics concept art) with a heavy emphasis on the musical accompaniment.\n\nPremise:\nEssentially a playable opera, Players take on the role of soldiers in one of two opposing armies locked in a tragic war.\n\nPlayers make their own characters with an RPG lite system to fill or invent different roles.\n\nAs a playable opera music is key, with each stage having its own theme that can shift and change dynamically based on the current state of the battle.\n\n\nKEY SYSTEMS\n\n-Character Creation:\nPlayers create there own characters with a simple yet flexible character creation system.\n\nStats are set at creation and do not increase with level.\n\nEach character selects a Primary and Secondary weapon as well as an armor and accessory type.\n\nAs characters level up they gain access to more varied and powerful skills and gear allowing for more complex and versatile builds.\n\nStats and Gear set the general ""tone"" (primary attack and defense actions, movement, defense and, attack values) of the character, while skills add subtlety and variety.\n\nA character's gear, skills and level will effect how quickly a player can respawn and, potentially, how valuable they are if a scoring system of some type is implemented. This system should be rather exponential, making high level characters a high value/high risk asset.\n\nBecause of the above system players can 'lock' a character at a certain level.\nAllowing players to create both low level cannon fodder characters as well as high level hero types.\n\nIdeally, this system would also give value to novice players, while also easing them into more complex abilities and builds.\n\n\n-Map System:\nEach map functions as a largely open field. \n\nScattered across the map are objective points. These are generally normal capture points, acting as spawns and allowing the team to encroach on the main objective.\n\nSome points, however, may have unique properties and claiming, protecting, or destroying them could provide or deprive either side of a bonus or trigger a field event.\n\nField events could also trigger under any number of conditions and can be used to provide tactical options, maintain balance or, to add variety to gameplay.\n\nI.e. :\nCapture a certain command point to trigger an airship strike.\nIf one side is pressing very quickly this could trigger a hero unit to spawn to aid help the losing side regain ground.\n\n\n-Campaign:\nThe campaign would be fully playable either in multiplayer or solo.\n\nPossibly allow for branching progression depending on certain conditions.\nI.e. Whether your side won or lost, triggering specific events, etc.\n\n\nMost everything else I have in mind would be minutiae; weapon types, play balance, etc. Have at it lads and lasses."

o5hkl5,"A text-based, multiple ending type game that revolves around someone visiting the barber.","WARNING:  THE FOLLOWING IDEA EXPLORES THEMES OF DEPRESSION AND SUICIDE\n\nIF ANYTHING I'VE WRITTEN IS INSENSITIVE TOWARDS PEOPLES SUFFERING THESE CONDITIONS IN ANY WAY PLEASE EDUCATE ME IN THE COMMENTS\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nVisited the barber a few weeks ago, and I realised how much I talk about with the barber, even though I see them only a few times a year.  So the idea for this game is a text-based game where you play the role of the barber, and a client keeps visiting you every few months.  The client will strike up conversation, and a variety of different responses are available each time.  The client will remember these responses and perhaps interwork them into future conversations.  Over time, the client will have certain events crop up in their lives (depression, loses job etc.), and you as the barber have to pick up on the cues that something is going wrong in their life, and try to talk them to a happier ending across several visits.  There would be a set of events that could pop up randomly in each playthrough, and below is a rough idea of how a playthrough could progress.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst visit (introduced to character, basic chat, establishes their family, friends, hobbies etc.)\n\nSecond visit (more casual chat, but slightly deeper, more personal things i.e. death of a family member recently)\n\nThird visit (something is now wrong with the character, cues can be picked up that they are struggling i.e. offhandedly mentioning that they gave up a few of their old hobbies etc.)\n\nFourth visit (more visible that they are struggling, possible phone call from partner where problems can be heard over phone, their dialogue could be more sullen)\n\nFifth visit (clear that they are struggling, mentions that they have been feeling kind of down recently etc., may already be too late).\n\nThere is no sixth visit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDuring the above playthrough, you would have several chances to try and dissuade the person from committing suicide through dialogue choices or other possible means, such as calling helplines etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother mechanic would be a newspaper that you get to see the front page of before each visit.  This would feature news stories that would come up in conversation, and would feature news of the client's suicide if you aren't able to help them in time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe idea of the client being depressed is just one idea I had, and there could be several other story arcs such as losing job, or even happier ones such as winning a small fortune from the lottery or the client getting engaged etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf anyone decides to do anything with this idea, I'd love to be involved with the development of plotlines and story, shoot me a pm and I'd be happy to help if you want."
o5ggw3,Open city free running game following a graffiti artist,"I just had an idea for a game that I'd seriously love to play.  Imagine something like a cross between JSRF and Mirror's Edge in an open city map.   Instead of the more course clear style of Mirror's Edge though, the city is laid out in a way that that style of free-running can be employed to traverse it quickly and efficiently.  This concept would more or less eliminate the idea of combat, but would likely add some more stealth elements. \n\nAs for what we're doing in this city, we are a graffiti artist whose goal is to get their work up in the craziest, hardest to get spots imaginable. I feel like a game like this should really dig into the culture of street art on the whole, and the motives that drive people to do it.  Imagine meeting NPC's who are also artists who you can go on ""missions"" with.  You learn from them about spots that people have tried and failed to get to in the past, and you take these as a challenge.  Depending on your relationship with certain characters, they may show up and help you out if everything goes sideways.  \n\nIn addition to these side missions with others and the main missions of getting to ""heaven spots"", there are also a lot of cool opportunities for ""collectables"".  For example, one aspect of this culture is that, when famous graffiti artists die, word tends to get out, and people will paint crowns floating over their works.  Imagine our character has a relationship with or family member who was a famous graffiti artist, and, anytime you find one of their pieces, you get to paint a crown over it and get rewarded (with maybe a skill point or something).  You could even accumulate a few artists who you do this for based on story events or whatnot, and each could have their own skill tree associated with how many of their works you found.  \n\nAs for conflict, I'm imagining police are an obvious threat, and should be part of the central conflict.  However, there should also be some animosity with people more like you.  Imagine a villain who's kinda like a stand-in for an artist like Banksy. Uses stencils, political, beloved by the media, wears a mask, shows up to taunt you, covers up your work with his or modifies it to make it his own.  Missions where you chase him that test your free running chops.  I'm imagining a cutscene where you wake up after pulling off a crazy tag, and turning on the news.  They're talking about your piece, but, when they show it, there's a frame stenciled around it with 2 people stenciled in front of it in saying ""Hmm. It's pretty... but is it really art?""\n\nI don't know, it just feels like a pretty easy well to tap in terms of inspiration.  I've got a lot more ideas about it too, but my post is ramble-y enough as is.  I am starting out in game design, but this is like... WELL beyond anything I could reasonably ever accomplish to the standard I feel it deserves, so it's an idea I'd rather just put out there.  Criticism and thoughts are welcome."

o5alrl,[Mod] Red Faction: Guerrilla - A Gary's Mod-like sandbox where one can place/spawn buildings and then destroy them,"https://store.steampowered.com/app/20500/Red_Faction_Guerrilla_Steam_Edition/\n\n*If you're a modder who can pull this off, I would be open to talking about paying you to do this. I have no idea what it would involve or cost, but feel free to reply with some 'ballpark figures'.*\n\n---\n\n**Name:** The Guerrilla Enclosure (or call it whatever you like)\n\n**Concept Overview:**\n\n* One of the main things I love about this game is the demolition of huge structures. It occurred to me early on that I was only doing missions and progressing through the story in order to reach new areas and buildings and to unlock better tools for the destruction of said buildings. It made me dream of a mod which was basically a generic 'open space' in which I could spawn and place buildings, then demolish them at my own pace with whatever tools and explosives I wanted. It's so therapeutic, a full-on mod where this is the focus could be THE lockdown stress reliever!\n\n**Plot:**\n\nNone.\n\n**Setting:**\n\nMars, I guess? But an empty grey box would be fine with me.\n\n**Characters:**\n\n* No need for extra characters to choose from besides the main one, but I guess it could be interesting to be able to play as other NPC character models when using the mod. Whatever the case may be, his/her abilities would be an unlimited supply of explosives and maxed-out tools/abilities!\n\n**Gameplay Mechanics:**\n\n* The only additional mechanics needed here are the ability to load up a menu and select a structure, then choose where it should go. In fact, just spawning it somewhere within eyesight of the player is fine. Would be cool to be able to spawn vehicles and other objects, too. I would also like to be able to save the current state of the space as a loadable template or pre-made 'map', so if I find a setup I like I can just reload that instead of placing everything manually each time.\n\n**Standout Features:**\n\n* Explode buildings without restriction or restraint.\n\n**Possible Platforms:**\n\n* PC\n\n**Extra Features:**\n\n* Share your 'maps' on the Steam Workshop.\n\n**How To Credit Me:**\n\nGlamlore, Master of Destruction and Chaos (no credit needed, just make it happen!)"

The plot of the game is to get your stuffy back - but the problem is, it is night and as a child that is afraid of the dark, you must be wary of monsters!

o56kk3,My first concept. Please give feedback if you are interested in the idea.," \n\n   Hello!\n\n   My name is Konstantin, I am 25 years old, I am from Russia and I am studying to be a game designer. Today I would like to present to your attention the concept of the game, which, perhaps, will leave pages of Google Docs and Google Sheets one day and appear before you as a digital version of work of my future team and mine.\n\n   *Sorry in advance for possible mistakes in spelling, as English is not my native language.*\n\n   My game in the genre of tactical turn-based aims to simulate a small clash between two sides of the enemy. **What's so interesting about that?**\n\n* Developed lvl-design - the clash takes place in closed spaces, actively pushing opponents, forcing them to act actively. At the moment, there are no plans for procedural generation, since freehand level balancing is the most flexible solution and the easiest for an indie-team;\n* full interaction with the location - do you want to destroy a wall, a building, a car? Let’s do it! Controlled explosion or not? Choose, but remember that the fragments from the building, shop windows, fragments can damage or destroy not only the enemy, but also your own soldiers;\n* medicine - a person in war is terribly vulnerable, from a bullet to an accidental fragment. All of this can cause damage that is incompatible with life. However, there is a person who can save you - a medic. Think about where to provide first aid? Drag the fighter from the first line or a few more moves he will not last... your choice;\n* depersonalized units - there is no confrontation between countries, this is enough in real life. This is a simulation of a clash, so let it be like a simulation. Thanks SUPERHOT we've seen how it can be;\n* phase-by-phase motion mechanics - we don't follow each other. We walk together. A vivid example of the phase-by-phase mechanics of the move is the rock, paper, scissors game;\n* short matches - no more than 30 minutes per match. As concise and fast as possible, almost like chess for a while.\n\n   The game has no plot component. You are completely immersed in the game, where the match is a new challenge to achieve the goal and reveal the tactics of your opponent.\n\n   **How to play it?**\n\n   Each match begins with the fact that you inspect the map and under your action plan “buy "" for points for hiring units - this can be a shooter, engineer, sapper, medic, machine gunner and others. Maybe even a flamethrower? Why not! On your part of the location where you start the game, place units - your small squad, with which you will achieve victory or lose, losing everything. Then you plan your move by choosing the models of behavior of the soldiers, setting them the paths of movement, indicating the trajectories of shooting. After clicking ""End of Turn"", you wait for your opponent to finish their planning, then run the simulation and look at the process you have planned. Before your eyes, the battle unfolds, where you decide what and how to do your soldiers. However, do not forget about the time, it is not recommended to delay.\n\n   References to the game can be: X-COM, Laser Squad Nemesis, Door Kickers, Into the Breach, Phantom Doctrine.\n\n   Thank you for your attention!"

o55rz4,beginner game ideas for 2D games,"I am a beginner at programming, I am trying to learn coding but I wouldn't focus too much on it ***just yet***. I am using Unity and want to create a simple yet enjoyable game (without limits) like flappy bird or crossy road. I currently need simple game ideas. Thanks :)"
o55daq,Code spaceships to explore and build in a galaxy... stored on Blockchain!,"I've been learning about Blockchain this week, and for the last year or so I've ALSO had an idea for a programming game (like Screeps). \n\nBlockchain seems like a fun way to build a game for hobby coders, and it'd be cool to create AI spaceships that travel through a distributed virtual galaxy!!! (Or maybe solarsystem, idk what the potential speed of a Blockchain server can get up to... Galaxy might be too big). \n\nNote for coders and Blockchain enthusiasts: \nI'd want to program it with Proof of Stake or Proof of Burn algorithms, because Proof of Work is destroying our planet and causing a GPU crisis.\n\n# Game Idea\n\nYou start with a ship that can harvest resources from planets and asteroids, trade resources with other ships, explore the game world, and spend resources to create more ships under your ownership! \n\nYou can use resources harvested to create new modules for your ship as well. One important module would be the research module. Consume a resource (ex., Iron) in the research module to create 'Research Plans'.\n\nResearch Plans can be traded, or stored on a ship to up the effeciency of any related modules... \nExample: Research Plans for Hydrogen might make hydrogen based engine modules run better, and your ship go faster.\n\nPlaying the game is equivalent to writing scripts that feed 'transactions' to the Blockchain server. So a code snippet might be:\n\nmove_to(ship_id, position_x, position_y)\nharvest(ship_id, planet_id)\nmove_to(ship_id, home_x, home_y)\ntrade_to(ship_id, other_ship_id, resource, quantity)\n\nYou can choose to program and build many ships, or just one badass ship. You could specialize your ship(s) for trading with other ships for resources or resource locations. Alternatively, you could focus on making a big pirate armada and attacking lone traders in the vastness of space. Or you could just start a space communism organization and share your resources and coding techniques freely to all.\n\nI know this is a little niche. That's why I thought I'd post the idea. I'd like to know if it is alluring at all to anybody! I do think it'd be a great way for coders to up their skills and also it could help beginner coders learn the basics."

o52pdd,"A PvP game where you play as movie actors, with one team being protagonists, and the other are enemy extras.","A game idea I just thought up. I don't have any plans to make it, let alone have the skills to be able to do so.\n\nMy idea is a multiplayer team-based PvP game, where one team are the 'protagonists', and the other team are like the nameless grunts in a movie. The goal of both teams are to basically be as cool and stylish as possible. I'm thinking that the protagonist side is controlled similarly to Chivalry or Mordhau or something, and they try to get to the objective destination both as fast as possible and with the most points by doing stylish stunts, like flawlessly combo-ing an enemy and just being some badass medieval knight or something. (that is the setting or theme of some movie that I imagine the game set in) \n\nThe other team however, try to slow them down, but they also get points by doing stunts, like falls and trying to make the other team look good, as if they were in a movie. I'm imagining that if you took enough damage as an enemy grunt you would be hit backwards and given control mid-air similarly to Saints Row's insurance fraud mini-game. You would get more points if you position your fall into breakable objects or onto spikes or something. \n\nI imagine that a round of this game would allow you to play both sides, where a team would ultimately win by getting the most cumulative score, and an overall time getting to the objective as a protagonist would add to their score. One team would get to the objective to set a score and then the teams would change sides, so that if you played the grunts in one round, you would switch to the protagonists to set an objective score.\n\nI feel like both sides could offer much different gameplay, and yet not be any less fun than one another, similar to Left 4 Dead's multiplayer infected mode, or the multiplayer from the most recent Splinter Cell game. I'm no game designer so I wouldn't know all the details or how to properly balance it, but I think this idea could make for a fun and casual multiplayer game."
o52cdk,Making a game soon can you give me weapon ideas but use your imagination !!!,[removed]
o4xoay,"Survival platformer game, with multiplayer in 2D style, where players can't kill one another directly","Hello there, I would like your opinion/thoughts about an idea I'm thinking about for a few time now, I would like to develop it but I'm not sure I'm going in the right direction, a bit of help would be greatly appreciated !  \n\n\nSo basically the game is like a 2D platformer fighting game (like Stick Fight or Tower Fall), in a closed arena (so fixed camera), up to 4 players, but where the players can't kill each other. The main idea is to be the last survivor. Actually the arena is full of traps that the players have to dodge as longer as possible.  \nMaybe the players could have the ability to dash/push players, taking risk to suicide themselves but that can help push another player into a trap, so it's still possible to play aggressively. A grab and throw ability could be interesting too. Same for some items to pick and use or throw.  \nFor players that are killed early, maybe like in recent Bomberman games they could still participate and for example trigger some traps by hand (by moving their ghost for example), so they're not bored waiting the level to finish.  \nThen for the worst player he would be able to choose a new power to help him for the next combat, so the game isn't only based on skill and the score can remain more balanced over time.  \nAlso to avoid players sticking in a corner of the arena, a non moving gauge can fill up make them die (like in Move or Die), or a quick sudden death could appear to push the players to regroup one another into the center of the arena.  \n\n\nAbout the art, I'm thinking about voodoo dolls into environments made of alive toys for example, to turn the deaths into ""funny"" moments (no blood / gore stuff). The idea would be something like ""Kick the Buddy"" mobile game, where a lot of possibilities are open thanks to the cartoony aspect.  \nAlso the dismemberment that dolls allow could be part of the gameplay, like ""life points"" but with some disability based on what remains of the body.\n\nWhat do you think about that ? Feel free to ask any question, I'll try to answer straight to the point."
o4u407,What would you like to see new in a metroidvania game?,
o4r27w,Zombie apocalypse and you are slowly becoming a zombie.,"You are slowly becoming a zombie. \n\nThe first part of the game is a stealth game where you are trying to avoid the zombies. \n\nLater you become more and more zombie like and you just have to act like a zombie to go through the zombies. You might also have to fight them as well. \n\nLater you have to also try to avoid people to not get killed because you really look like a zombie.\n\nThe background story:\n\nThere is a virus that turns you into a zombie. It begins by taking over control of the brain and then slowly slowly it changes the body as well. It starts as a weird moving zombie, and in a span of days it progresses to a more muscled, high metabolism zombie that is fast, strong and also heals itself. The stronger they become the zombies, the more sensitive they become to the light and they cannot be out in the day. In the night, they will show aggression towards light sources. \n\nThe hero's story:\n\nYou are a scientist in a research facility where they try to find a cure for the zombie plague. The vaccine is not working yet, but at least it slows down the brain controlling process. The research facility gets invaded by the zombies and you have to bring the vaccine to another facility to continue the research. You are not chosen because you are the best, but merely because you are the only option. You are an average person of average stamina and strength and no weapon/fighting skills.\nAt some point before you exit the facility you get bitten by a zombie and you decide to inject yourself and carry the vaccine in your blood instead. You only have a GPS map with you and you have to make your way to the other facility - where they are waiting for you.\nYou can walk or use bikes, maybe also vehicles if you are lucky. On your journey you will have to avoid zombies, pretend you are one of them, sometimes fight them. You would be able to use weapons but with limited succes since you are not experienced enough. You would have to also avoid other people while your body becomes more and more zombie like, avoid light or have to wear sunglasses to travel through the day and eat a lot because your metabolism is changing. You will have to act as humane as possible to keep your sanity and your mind clear, otherwise the virus will take over your mind. Eventually you will gain new abilities like night vision, advanced hearing, regeneration. Later in the game you would be able to run faster, jump higher and parkour around. From time to time you might lose control, or black out and just wake up in random places.\n\nThere will be dogs, but you cannot pet them because they would be running away from you! o_o"
o4qlkd,"An Open world game that doesn't tell you what to do next, forcing you to discover the story line of dozens of individuals all part of an even larger story line that culminates into a magnificent end.","Just imagine grand theft auto, without a mission tab. The possibility of choosing between good, evil and neutral is there, allowing for all sorts of different endings and playthroughs. \n\nInstead of getting missions, you create them yourself. You could ignore participating in the main story line and watch from the sidelines eating popcorn as shit pops off at the end, or be the bad guy and be blasting away at good guys to further your empire.\n\nYou'd have to make money like in real life, legally or illegally. You start rock bottom, no skills, getting temp jobs through a job placement agency, or selling dime bags to high schoolers. \n\nTime is valuable though, you only get a certain amount of ingame years before there's a game ending event, forcing you to start over, making you value your time more efficiently.  \n\nSo you go to college/police academy/military/property management or you start buying drugs in kilos and pimpin early game, so as to build up the quickest arsenal against the other side. Or you could be the neutral guy and sell the guns legally or illegally to both sides. \n\nAnd you fill the game with characters like Grand theft auto, all each with backstory and interesting interactions which may lead to adventure and big money gains. \n\nThe emphasis is on the npc characters and how you choose to work with them. You could go to college and pay for it by doing some prostitution on the side for good ole Pepperjack. 100 percent there is a strip club owned by a dude named Javier. \n\nYou could go to police academy but secretly work for the mob, and recreate The Departed. You could flip it and work undercover for the police, and undermine the bad guy's whole operation, which will bleed into the main story. \n\nSide hustles will be a major part of the game and will involve mortal npc characters, who can die or go to prison if caught. \n\nTo make it infuriatingly hard, but oh so satisfying when you defy death or prison,  you force the game to restart to first day after death or imprisonment. You could make sure to only commit misdemeanors and get to pay a fine. \n\nThe main point is that it's a story intensive, choose your own journey, filled with consequences that will break your heart or inspire you to self actualize, unhindered by procedural missions. You could go straight for baller status. You can easily change the way in which you involve other npcs in your side hustles/personal missions on each playthrough. \n\nSay you buy a kilo of cocaine, you can then hire other NPCs as dealers with questionable personality defects, like a crackhead, who will have a name, backstory and endless interaction possibilities. \n\nOr say you buy a business, you can then go through an interview process with your employees that will fill your business with  characters that link to side hustle and personal mission opportunities.  \n\nThe best part would be interactions between NPCs, that's where relationships and a Machiavellian soap opera is revealed, in which you can participate in with a dozen or so dialogue options."
o4p50i,Jojo's Bizarre Adventures (VR) *spoilers*,"The main premise of the game I was thinking of was PVP or PVE using stands from the anime. I came up with the simple basics of stand fighting and thought of how that would work.\n\nHold a certain button to summon your stand and still have it leashed to yourself. While holding this button, the stand mimics your movements, while you can also move it freely using the left analogue stick. This allows a fast, short distance defense and offense. The player will be able to use their own movements to make the stand block, defend and attack. \n\nHowever stands can have special abilities either activated by a button or hand gestures. For example, Jotaro's Ora barrage would be a perfect ability along with his stop time ability as these would be humanly impossible to reanact.\n\nStands should also be able to be controlled remotely and have the player see through the stands eyes. Instead of holding a button, the player taps it instead and summons their stand. However, they become the stand. The player's character is still there, but they just have complete control over the stand. They see through its eyes and can have a lot more manueverability. They can still activate special attacks. Maybe even gain more attacks in this mode. \nLike the other mode, you can control the stand using arm movements and the analogue stick. Flying stands can have their elevation controlled too.\nIf the players actual character is hit, their stand returns to their body and the player could have a slight knock-back allowing them to escape the opponents next hit and summon their stand again. Punching should be completed through actually punching, and not a button. Like many of the vr boxing games. \n\nWinners are determined by an NPC's or player's health, or perhaps willpower, if you want to keep it in-line with the anime."

o4781t,Open-world RPG/Action RPG in an aerial environment with airships and mounts,"We have diverse RPG's taking place mostly on land, we've had some in the sea or featuring naval segments, we have space RPG's, but very little to no RPG's purely exploring the skies. Perhaps because no one is exactly sure how it would translate for a typical hack and slash/spellcasting character, or how exactly open air would be interesting and allow for map design, and so forth. But I think it has great potential, and I'll give my personal vision of how it could work out:\n\n**Setting** - A high fantasy steampunk magical world where the surface has been afflicted by a cataclysm of some sort, such as the emergence of evil creatures from the underground or paranormal corruption that turned it into a hostile place, full of noxious gases, uninhabitable conditions and dangerous creatures , forcing the world's denizens to use magic and technology to take to the skies, where new floating civilizations and communities are established away from the chaos below. This also serves as the justification for not being able to descend to the ground and keeping the aerial element in the spotlight.\n\n**Gameplay** -  Simply playing as a flying person wouldn't innovate much and likely be inferior to traditional ground environments and combat, so instead you will essentially be piloting a vehicle or mount of some kind permanently, which also serves as your primary source of character progression. It would probably be best in third-person, and I propose 3 main 'classes' to start with:\n\n*Airship Pilot* - The Fighter/Ranged equivalent, wherein you rely on cannons, weapons, ramming and grappling attacks, etc etc to assail enemies.\n\n*Mounted rider*  - You fly a magical beast which works well for both melee archetypes ( Claws, tails, wing swipes, fangs, etc etc ) and for spellcasters with  creatures capable of magical attacks and the rider's own spell flinging\n\n*Steampunk Glider/Kite apparatus* - Rogue equivalent, piloting a small and fast vehicle allowing you to perform quick attacks like slashing sails with sharp protrusions, blowing out smoke in a radius to enable stealth in the air, bomb throwing and planting, etc.\n\n As you level up you invest in skills that allow you to improve your handling, speed, aim, magical abilities, crafting of steampunk bombs/devices, repair, tinkering, etc and more importantly granting you access to better vehicles, bigger airships with more firepower and crew, greater beasts from wyverns to griffons flying serpents and creatures unique to the lore, sleeker and gliders, and specific upgrade trees - hull, engine, ballistas or cannons or magical steampunk weapona for airships, new tricks, growth and spells for the spellcater, more stealth options and devices for the rogue archetype, and so on.\n\n**Locations** - As examples of fascinating aerial zones where combat and exploration and dialogue can be utilized, You can have like a 'Pirate Warrens' zone where a ton of airships litter the radius vicinity, trading in smuggled goods, chilling, etc besides makeshift floating platforms and docks and you have to navigate it and fight opponents who accost you, you can have a wonky magical gravity zone with floating islands and debris from the ground, or a more dungeon-like zone set in some giant abandoned medusa-shaped zeppelin , zones where hostile flying creatures and flora have ecosystems, the list goes on.\n\nInbetween there are the civilized communities and friendly encounters with structures and cities kept afloat either by technology ( Engines/balloons/etc) or magical energy by the exclusive races/communities that have the knowledge to maintain it.\n\n**Conclusion** -  Aside from the main concept described, I don't have anything particular or remarkable to suggest for the plot or the quests, just imagine your standard fare Dragon Age/Skyrim/Witcher/Baldur's Gate type of storyline except in a unique environment with aerial combat and interactions."
o45dt3,A sports game set in a brutal dictatorship,"The game would be like a parody of sports titles like California Games and Track &amp; Field, except set in a strict authoritarian country that punishes poor athletic performance.\n\nThere would be a mix of events like: golf, BMXing, skateboarding, inline skating, surfing, long jump, 100m dash, weightlifting, hurdles, high jump, etc.\n\nDifficulty settings adjust the game's difficulty, the weather conditions you'll experience, the amount of obstacles, and how the state will punish you for failure. On the hardest difficulty, you'll be straight-up executed for failing to win a medal in an event."

Or how certain mobs are scared of other things like Skeletons fearing Wolves, Creepers fearing Cats, etc.).\n\n\nEither that, or you can bring your own ideas onto the table and give other ways on how to deal with enemies in no-kill ways.\n\nAgain, you can still ""hurt"" them (like temporarily knocking them out/dazing them so you can get away for example). Just outright killing them/defeating them doesn't count."
o3sv7n,"I'm looking for ideas for 2D, maybe semi 3D Horror game with story telling (maybe even passivly) and no guns, makeshift tools tops","My inspiration is Five Night's ar Freddy's, but I don't want to make a copy either.

o3spie,Anime Tower Defense Game?,"A tower defense game with anime characters, enemies, and maps. The game would be 3D where the ""Gamemaster"" (you) could move around the map (to place your characters ofc) so it's not a top-down/birds-eye view.  \n\n\nThere could also be different features like abilities and Goldens. Abilities would be special powers you would get from fully upgrading the character. For example, if you fully upgrade Goku, he would get a special ability that allows him to transform into Ultra Instinct (boost all stats like damage, speed, range) and more. Goldens would be different (and improved) forms of characters that you would get from combining 3 (maybe) of their normal forms. For example, if you had 3 normal Narutos, you could combine them to make 1 Golden Naruto.  \n\n\nMaybe, there could even be different gamemodes like a ""Battles/Versus"" where you play against someone else to see who can survive longer and ""Co-op"" where you cooperate and play *with* someone.  \n\n\nHonestly, I would just like another good tower defense game (similar to Bloons TDs' greatness) to play with friends."

o3q7xn,A streaming game,"Ok so here's my idea:\nYou get into a website that has been popular around the internet for it's famous streamers in it, but once you enter the website you see that it's empty and only have a few pages to open.\nIn every page there'll be a clue to get into your first streamer's page. Once you get there, you can look for more clues.\nThe clues can be in the streamer's bio, the stream itself, the chat, past streams, you get the idea, and then you get to more streamers and more streamers.\nThe ""final goal"" is to reach the biggest streamer's page on this website, and that will be the hardest.\nIf the player get to that page, the website will announce them as the user that completed the entire website, and you gain popularity.\nThen, the website gives you two choices:\nA. Become a streamer. If you pick this you become the new most popular streamer.\nB. Give up the offer, and then the game ends.\n\n\nAlong the way of finding clues, as you get more and more clues, you get private messages from other users that threaten you to stop, because they want to be the first users to complete the website.\nOR\nYou can get offers from a group of users that plans on completing the website together and become the ""group of users that completed the website"" and share the fame it brings.\n\n\n\nThe game can have one ending, or more."
o3n9cs,Minesweeper 99 sounds like a dope idea,"I recently learned how to play Minesweeper and it gave me a random thought. Since we have a Tetris 99 and a Pac-Man 99, a Minesweeper 99 sounds pretty dope and could totally work."
o3macf,Driving Simulator,"The game would be very similar to Microsoft's Flight Simulator. The main idea is to have a photorealistic driving game. This wouldn't be a racing game, just an American driving simulator. You can drive anywhere in the United States, spawn anywhere in the United States, and it would be fun to go on road trips with your friends, just drive to somewhere you go all the time, etc. The game would have a lot of cars to choose from, you just select your car, select where you want to spawn and there you go. There would be a gas feature where your car runs out of gas, and you go get gas. Basically it would have every feature a car in real life has. You could put your windows down unlike any other racing/driving game (although there are not many driving sim games out there right now). A radio feature would also be implemented where you can go on the internet and play anything from there. Such as going on iHeartRadio's website, or just going on Spotify and playing your own playlist. The game would be playable with keyboard/mouse (although that would be the worst to play it with), a normal controller, or a controller steering wheel with pedals. It would support VR to make it feel extra realistic, but not required of course. In the options it would have realistic mode and cinematic mode, realistic mode would have more realistic lighting but would look worse and the cinematic mode would be less realistic lighting but look better for videos, screenshots, etc. I feel like I'd play this game hours on end driving from my house to Disney World or something. That is the one game I want to see happen in my lifetime. Let me know what you would think of a game like this as well!"

o3kigo,Hello I'm new to the whole creating games thing but I want to know if this sounds like a good beginner game,Ok first if you found interest in my post thx. All criticism and feedback is welcome.\nSo now on to my game idea. \n\nSo you start off in a forest just kinda wondering around as you wonder you find a cute little squirrel sitting on a stump as you go to pet it the screen shakes and glitches next thing you know your in a bedroom laying on a bed then after a few seconds it goes back to the forest but there's something different about it is it the lightning the sound the forest its self you can't quite figure it out. Then you continue on your way.\n\nNotes: Its 2d and I'm still new at game development but I can write story's so I got that going g for me
o3jypo,Can anyone suggest ideas for my 3D racing game,I am making a 3D racing game with a concept of the player racing through time and visiting historical events does anyone have any ideas to expand on this. Any help is appreciated.
o3jj8w,"A simple 2d and open world game that harbors the essence of the dragon ball z story itself, but not like every other dragon ball z game has done before","Firstly, for those who have showed interest in my post, thank you for your time, i welcome any advice or criticism on my post, as to where i can further adjust or edit it to make it more of an plausible idea for game developers out here. \n\n~BASICALLY THE ENTIRE STORY SUMMED UP~\n\nYou play as your own custom character, then start of as a young adult ( maybe around like 18 - 21), and you character has abnormal strength, and a constant hunger to fight and become stronger up until you die from either age or a battle that was just to much for you to handle.\n\n~THE SETTING/WOLRD~\n\nIt is set in a modern civilization, where you have about 4 or so areas you are able to travel to, such as the main town/city where you can buy food, clothing, potions and so on. A training area who other people go to battle each other, train their skills, learn other skills and recruit other characters. A hosing area, where you live and stay and sleep. And a foresty area with a river where you can hunt and catch fish and animals to eat or sell their meat for money.\n\nThis part might be far-fetched but, also the opportunity to travel your home galaxy to other planets, where there is the same basic set up such as 4 areas to visit and go, like i said above, with the only difference being the characters maybe and the colour scheme. Maybe 8 planets? Im not sure about how much effort it would take to make 1 itself, so maybe 8 is to much, but the reason why i said 8 is so that, for every planet there could be a chance that its either a friendly civilization or a evil civilization where they look to kill or imprison you ( or something along those lines), also to add on, if you come across a friendly civilization, you can train with their fighters, and help them fight off, or go on adventures to fight against an evil civilization trying to invade them.\n\nAlso, my entire idea of the traveling system and things is similar to the aspect of a game called LCS ( liberal crime squad ), its where i got the idea of recruiting and traveling, since the traveling system is fairly simple, such as "" you need a car to travel here"", so you get money for a car and then you are able to travel to x area, for that game specifically, you could be in LA and travel to SEA, and do basically the same things there, the only difference being the names of the areas. \n\n~COMBAT~\n\nCould either be a simple event screen where you choose a specific skill ( text based), or a simple 2d point and click game who you choose your skill and use it on your opponent.\n\nWhat also could be unique is a text pop up where you can choose like an a-d option of like, try to calm to situation down and talk it out so you don't fight, straight to fighting, run away or a intimidate option.\n\nAnd after the fights done, a option to kill your opponent, let him go and survive or try and recruit him depending on your own skill\n\nAlso, it should be an option to out think your opponent, such as instead of straight brute force and power, you can use specific techniques to win\n\n~FURTHER IDEAS~\n\nAnd that's about it I've thought of, my entire idea is basically a dragon ball z type of game, where you main objective is to fight, recover and grow stronger, so after every fight, you heal yourself and you get a boost of power, like in dragon ball z \n\nAlso, to get a wife and get a child or more to grow and help you fight, so when you die, you can take over as them, and lead your fight onwards, you can train them and so on\n\nAnnndd, it could also be an idea of having fist combat, spells and ki blasts and transformations possible, like powerups or rage modes etc"
o3i4ya,Survival Horror Warhammer Fantasy,"The game idea is a single player survival Horror game set in the Warhammer Fantasy universe. The game concept is large but confined to a singular city/town. \n\nThe 10k foot idea is being an Empire Guardsman that is in a town during a beastmen raid. With no way to fight against the horde, the idea is to escape the town while avoiding the beastmen attacking. \nThe game would be 3D."
o39sym,Open Galaxy In the Star Wars universe,"There is a lot that can be discussed on this topic so here's a thread for just that. Let me just premise a few things. The game must not be too ambitious but do dream a little. Let's try and think of HOW it could work and not just what we want in the game.\nFor instance, Should it be story or multiplayer focused? could an economy (credits) work? If so, how? What incentives might exist to prompt player growth (like an RPG leveling up mechanic)"
o37x1b,Class-based Survival Game,"Pretty self-explanatory, takes place in a medieval time period, each class has their own mechanics, e.g an alchemist being the only class able to brew and make really good food, a cleric having religion-based mechanics such as a karma system, engineers being able to build automated or manned defences, a necromancer that can summon undead to automate tasks and man defences, dwarves being able to build structures that aid in resource gathering, etc. I think this would make for a really good multi-player game because maybe classes could overlap, eg an alchemist being able to imbue a knight's sword or an engineer's ballista bolts."

nyk3bn,A Nerf themed FPS or 3ps shooter,"Since a new Hot wheels game was announced, I thought of some more toy related games. A shooter based on nerf weapons. Loadout similar to tf2 with a primary, secondary, and melee. There can be ammo boxes to pick up, I am unsure about support weapons, and some weapons have an overwatch style “ultimate” like shooting an extremely powered projectile, or extremely faster firing/reload. Practice range is a house, destroying random stuff, and there could be a wave mode based on the zombie theme, or adventure mode based on the badlands theme."
nyimez,Question for Lovecraftian/cosmic horror game,Is the self-aware AI or virus considered a cosmic horror in game that is filled with npc? If so I have the idea for it.
nyi9x8,Simple idea: a fighting game with the professions of the real world. Every month/two weeks a new fighter is introduced,"I always liked the idea of party fighting games (brawlhala, super smash bros) but more so, games in wich the fighters were normal professions, so why not mix both and go on increasing the number of fighters? The movement set doesn't need to be very specific to all of them (brawlhala does this well. most of the movements are reskins) but it would be cool if they were\n\nExamples:\n\nFirefighter: bulky, can charge and run towards the opponent cancelling what they're doing and dragging them with him (reload time necessary), uses an axe to fight, special moves with water, can call a truck to run over people, and can use a ladder to climb without having to use the scenario. Moves slowly, but hits hard\n\nTeacher: small, can have a second of invulnerability while eating her lunch and this giver her health (reload time necessary), uses a blackboard eraser to fight, special moves with school supplies (pencil, paper plane), can scream to slow the opponent, and can call another teacher (during this time they fight together and can only use normal attacks). Agile, doesn't hit hard, but hits fast.\n\nAnd so on and so on. Having like 12 characters at the start is a good call, and then you add more regularly"
m0s1cd,One Piece MMORPG,"I've been thinking a lot about this,you know how these One Piece Roblox games are right?Imagine a mmorpg open world one piece game where you get to customize your character,choose what sea you come from (North,South,East,West) and you get to do anything you want in that world,become a marine and aspire to be an admiral,or be a pirate and aspire to be the pirate king,'till then you can be a shichibukai,bounty hunter,cp9 agent,impel down guard,etc... Devil fruits spawn randomly around the map and can be sold,you can buy legendary swords that are in the anime.Of course you get to make your own crew and battle against other pirate [crews.It](https://crews.It)'s so exciting to think about this type of game honestly,what do you guys think?"
m0oa9b,Metroidvania where the unlockables are really basic things like entering doors and accessing the menu,"I'm playing Evoland right now, which is very interesting but is more of a joke than a really deep game.  What I'm thinking is a more fully-fleshed-out exploration-based MV where the unlockables include really, really basic stuff like the map, the ability to single jump, the ability to run, the ability to play sound, etc., but in a way where you have to actually work to find these abilities.  Maybe you could play as a robot that can find attachments such as a map chip, a bouncy wheel (to replace the existing wheel), a larger wheel (to go faster with the same RPM), a microphone (to hear sound), etc.  Interestingly enough, there are already some games that explore this, like La-Mulana, where you have to unlock a lot of basic features at the beginning (in the original freeware version you even have to unlock saving, but thankfully you do start out with the ability to jump).  However, once you unlock these features in La-Mulana in the first hour or so of gameplay, they (almost) never become relevant again.  It would be very interesting to have a game where you're unlocking this kind of thing the whole way through.  One such ability to unlock could be the ability to switch off some ability you've previously collected.  The original Metroid did not have this ability (actually, neither does La-Mulana 1), and you needed the Ice Beam to beat the game, so if you ended up with the Wave Beam, which replaced the Ice Beam, you had to go and find another Ice Beam.  A similar mechanic could exist in this game until you acquire that ability to switch between abilities you've collected.\n\nIdeas for abilities: improved vision modules (with better resolution, better colors, ability to see IR or UV), microphones for the sound effects or music (where platforms are synced to the music), olfactory modules (to identify poison gas or flowers or whatever), a weapons module (a good chunk of the game needs to be playable without it), upgrades to said weapons module, the ability to access a menu (pausing should always be possible; don't screw over the player), the ability to run, the ability to jump, the ability to double jump (or a jetpack or something), a grapple module (unless it's too derivative, which is fine), the ability to see which upgrades you have, the ability to switch on/off which upgrades you have, the ability to access extra options on the upgrades you have, the obvious armor upgrades and weapon power upgrades and maybe a range of weapons to use that could include consumables, the ability to use bombs and such, the ability to look at a map (La-Mulana and Hollow Knight have this), the ability to see an upgraded map that maybe has your current location on it (La-Mulana and Hollow Knight have this too), the ability to shine a light (might want to switch it off when enemies are attracted to it), the ability to change the color of the light (including to IR or UV), and so on.\n\nAll of these abilities can be used to solve puzzles; they can all be reflected in the character's sprite/model; there are enough of them to keep exploration rewarding.  You could even have a system where you don't actually carry your old upgrades around with you; when you get a new one, you drop the old one that was in that same slot.  One map upgrade could show you the locations of these dropped upgrades; another upgrade could be a bag that can hold some amount of upgrades (possibly in a spatial inventory puzzle), which can itself be upgraded.  Upgrades could make your character too big to fit through some spaces, requiring you to remove them before you can go in.\n\nI think there's a lot of possibility here for a deep and engaging game with this concept.  It's not radical and several games have used elements of this (other examples: Ori doesn't start out letting you attack; Metroid makes you get the Long Shot; Legend of Zelda starts you without even a sword; obviously Evoland is the inspiration here), but no game that I've played (and I haven't played Evoland 2) has made significant use of these beyond the first hour of gameplay.  Hollow Knight and La-Mulana are the games that, I think, go the furthest in making the player earn basic things, though in both cases, the upgrades are mostly purchased in the starting town rather than given as rewards for exploration.  But can you imagine if La-Mulana started out *without* you having the whip or the Mobile Super X, the two things you start with?"
m0n2ba,"A hockey inspired game with super attacks, combat, no referee, and a wide cast of characters!","As a Canadian who played and loved the world of ""Super Mario Strikers"", it was a shame to never see another installment in the series, and an even bigger shame that the franchise never explored other sport genres such as hockey which is one of the least represented sports in gaming. \n\nIn this game you play as one of many famous hockey legends and compete against others in pursuit of the Worlds Puck Cup which will show once and for all that you truly are the best of the best when it comes to the ice. \n\nWhen playing you pick your captain which is one of the many hockey legends and each captain has their own supers, abilities and their own team of 5 made up of skeleton pirate crews, super rats, yo-yo robot dogs, and more that will help you score, save, defend and fight along your side, every step of the way.\n\nHere are just a few examples of the Captains that you would be able to choose from: https://imgur.com/gallery/3rGTfl6 \n\nGames last five minutes and fighting is absolutely tolerated."

m0izbv,Capture the flag but with actors,"It is played in real life, each actor is trained to do some parkour and fight choreography. He is a body, but has a camera which translates image live to brains - to player, who decides all strategical maneuvres and fight tricks to apply. Player has to explain clearly and quickly.\n\nThis is like controlling a robot, because actor is not allowed to improvise (but can refuse to do risky activities like ""- jump over this stream, here must be a shortcut - rocks are slippery, no""). But actor is better than a robot, because he can understand any idea without programming."

lzucc1,So what do you like about among us,
ly9c2w,A Minecraft themed adventurer,"I'd love to see a game based around the world of Minecraft. Not the same pixelated game, but a big triple A game with modern graphics and gameplay similar to Ghost of Tsushima or Assassin's Creed.\n\nI've always thought that the Minecraft mobs had the potential to be intriguing, and possibly quite creepy when thought of in a more life-like design. Minecraft as an open-world RPG would feel like a very strange fantasy game, with many different types of biomes, Zombies, Skeletons, Flying Manta Rays and obviously, the Ender dragon, staple of any fantasy game.\n\nI'm not sure how a game like this would work as far as story is concerned, perhaps you'd have to just completely make up something new. The Villagers would be a great way to implement side-quests. World events, similar to how AC Valhalla does things could be things like Mining challenges, Building Challenges, combat challenges and discovering high-quality loot. \n\nThe upgrade system would probably have to work like Minecrafts does, upgrading to the max level then we unlocking the next type of gear. Enchantments could take a similar position to the Charms in GoT.\n\nI'm sure there's many more features that could be thought of, being such a big game. It would almost DEFENITELY be an 18/R-rated game, with Zombies and The creepy design of the endermen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(I hope this isn't going against any plagiarism rules on the subreddit)"
ly8uv4,64 player coop military shooter,"A large scale military shooter game that has all humans on one side fighting AI to complete objectives. \n\nThe core gameplay loop would work as follows.\n\nThe game would make a procedurally generated mission available on the over world map. A player who is looking to command will apply and if multiple commanders apply the highest rank will be chosen. \n\nThat commander then has a specified amount of funds to spend. Those funds are spent on troops, equipment, vehicles and their crews. The commander can either micromanage specific squad compositions and special equipment, let the squad leaders choose, or let the soldiers choose.\n\nOnce the commander has set up his forces the way they like, the lobby opens and people can start to fill slots. As a player, you can queue for the role you wish to play and the game will find you a matching slot. While the lobby is filling the commander is finishing their plan. When the lobby is full the commander can begin the mission brief. They will have the ability to draw and place icons on maps and intel photos to communicate the plan.\n\nWhen the game starts, players will be in the transport vehicle at the time and place the commander specified. From there the units will try and carry out the commanders plan the best they can. \n\nCompleting the objective is only half the battle. Getting everyone home is always the primary objective. Players who are killed or seriously incapacitated can be picked up and carried. They must be loaded into medevac vehicles and removed from the AO. Those players can only return to the fight if the commander orders reinforcements. \n\nOnce the operation is over a after action report will be generated. This report details individual soldier performance as well as overall outcomes. Mission outcomes have the ability to affect the over world map causing areas to be harder or easier."
ly2gxq,Sandbox Apocalyptic Survival game,"It’s not stellar, but I think it would make an amazing edition to systems like Oculus or PlayStation VR.\n\nBasically, it’s a mix of Unturned and Walking Dead VR; you get all of the zombie fighting action of Walking Dead, but all of the building, scavenging, crafting, and multiplayer capabilities you had in Unturned. \n\nI don’t really have any core gameplay mechanics, so it really is a blank slate, and I don’t know much about making VR games, but the concept of a game like that sounds extremely fun.\n\n(If this really does somehow come to fruition I would love to know lol)"

ly1tj0,Not your stereotypical fighting game," This game would be a smash bros gameplay but maybe with some street fighter influences. This game would be about playing as different countries (either country balls or personified versions for how they look). The countries would be based on different stereotypes of that country or things that country is known for. (example: Denmark might have a lego attack because lego started in Denmark.) Would have all countries in it and maybe some territories, places that want independence, and/or historical countries. (Examples: Greenland, Catalonia, and Roman Empire, maybe even one alien character) Maps would based on different locations across the world. (Examples: On top of the Eiffel Tower, on the Golden Gate Bridge, Statue of Liberty, Oval Office, Etc.) Items would be in the game but also able to turn off. There would be a story mode. There wouldn’t be final smashes but more of like finishing moves like mortal kombat has. (As in the sense that they would match ending moves and not talking about the gore part, I don’t want that in this game.) Feel free to give ur ideas on characters, movesets,maps,items, gameplay mechanics, and etc. Also don’t take this the wrong way I believe u can laugh at different stereotypes as long as u can laugh at stereotypes of your own country."
lxyhn6,A game that combines Among Us and FTL,"I've never played Among Us, but from what I understand, the crew's tasks are reminiscent of Spaceteam - just random actions you have to do to keep the team alive.\n\nBut what if there were some overarching narrative, and a captain player who drives that narrative? Insert the game into the context of something like FTL. You have goals to achieve, some short term (trade with the aliens, destroy the pirate frigate) and some long term (deliver the intel to HQ, sabotage the rebel flagship), and all the players have to cooperate to achieve them. But there's an imposter whose goal is to kill the others while still making it out alive. So he can't just have the ship go hung ho into enemy territory because he'll die too, he'll need to arrange a way to exit the ship safely!"
lxvwm5,Open World Survival game set in Dante's Inferno,"In Dante's Inferno hell is described as consisting of nine concentric circles, which mark a descending scale of sins that humans are capable of.\n\nThat sounds like the good basis for an open world survival map. You would start as a soul dropped on to the outer most ring, purgatory, and would have to move through the rings to get to the center. Each ring would be a different biome with its own enemies and resources. Possibly a boss of each ring that you would have to beat before moving on. \n\nI think it could do well if it was structured like Valheim."

Father was working on a special operation by Germans that is still active.\n\nCutscene end of prequel chapters and linear game play - Stone is in England. He is informed by some NPC to meet Col Toughname at headquarters.\n\nAt this point the game becomes open world with England being the first chapter and level. \n\nStone can go meet Col and work on storyline quests. \n\nStone has to complete Story missions for Col to advance the game and open more of the world (Europe). \n\nIn England this could be missions involving German spies, double agents, saboteurs, infiltrators. It could feature things like the enigma code machine and plans involving special operations and information about D-Day. \n\nStone can also encounter non story side quests.\n\nSome involve military people. A group of soldiers can’t leave camp and want some booze. Will you be a pal and get them a bottle since your free to wander? \n\nSome involve civilians. An English mother whose husband is off at war can’t find her son since last nights air raid. Can Stone help?\n\nChapter 2 would begin when Stone is finished with England story missions and is parachuted into France. Side quests not finsihed in England can be returned to.\n\nIn France Stone has the same format of storyline and non-story gameplay events.  \n\nMilitary story line missions for the Col which advance the game and opens the world more. They also provide XP, specials skills, gear, weapons, and training. \n\nCivilian missions which work up XP and open up special skills, gear, weapons, and trainings. \n\nThe story missions and locations should coincide with real WWII events. \n\nPlot points of the game.\n\nThe Col continues to provide info on Stone's father through story missions.  These begin to tie in to encounters Stone has in the game. For example, in chapter 1 in England the final mission has a sub-boss who ties to the final boss. Final boss was somehow involved in stone's father's death. Sub bosses in missions along the way provide intel and clues for Stone. In chapter 2 another sub boss revealed at the end with next set of info. Some of these bosses can be 'plot-twist' style turncoats Stone worked with or trusted. \n\nSub bosses are part of a nefarious group within the German army. In existence since WWI. Final boss responsible for Stone's dad's death also leads group. Group's ultimate goal is German dominance through acquiring ancient secrets/relics that provide some power. \n\nThese are from various medieval ‘heretical sects': Bogomils, Cathars, Waldensians, Fraticelli, Triclavinism. This can add a bit of otherworldly or hyper abilities as Stone begins to gain 'powers'. Stone must collect these relics before the Germans. It could explain why he’s a super badass with signature moves and abilities destroying all and leaving a trail of dead in his wake. \n\nThe different locations of the sects in Europe historically allows Stone to move around Europe as he investigates and opens the map. He can also be parachuted to different locations for missions to open up the eastern front, Russia, Italy, Poland, etc.\n\nThese missions against the German group are the primary storyline quests and plots. The ability to complete certain story missions is dependent on ranking by XP. Non story missions help build this XP. For example a ranked 15 Stone can’t access or complete a level 20 mission. This motivates players to do side quests. \n\nA Chapter 1 mission could involve stone having to help a medical unit of some nature. Stone meets a nurse. Potential relationship story or just recurring NPC providing non storyline missions throughout the game and providing insight into the role women played in ww2.  \n\nGameplay points: like other open world games Stone can take out bunkers, outposts, or command posts he encounters in contested areas to reveal map, to 'weaken local enemies' for the partisans to defeat, build xp and obtain weapons. Assist partisans in different areas. Help civilians in need. Scout enemy forces prior to battle or commit acts of sabotage or espionage. Etc. \n\nStory and non story missions could involve helping partisans fight, sabotage such as blowing rail bridges, assisting other units (American and allied) in larger operations like market garden, battle of the bulge, bridge at Remagen, jedburgh (Airdrop of operatives into France, Belgium and the Netherlands to conduct sabotage and guerrilla warfare, and to lead the local resistance forces in actions against the Germans)...the list is long \n\nOne story questline could involve Stone working with the Monuments Men. The allied group dedicated to locating and saving art across Europe stolen by the Germans. One of the relics needed is among it somewhere. Stone saves the Mona Lisa or some shit and gets the relic.\n\nA recurring non main storyline could be an NPC who is a commander aka manager for the USO, the entertainment and morale group in WW2. A corny Hollywood type enlisted and now does all the arrangements for the stars and their shows. Through this we encounter different stars of their era and learn what they did in the war. Bob hope and Bing Crosby and other actors. Musicians like Benny Goodman and Irving Berlin. Pinup girls and female stars. (as an aside the game has a banging soundtrack of 30-40s era big band, swing, jazz, blues,etc from that era. Big and expansive like GTA or Fallout). \n\nImagine a mission where corny manager needs Stone's help because ""Betty Grable needs to get to Paris and all I have is a crummy Jeep to drive her! A Jeep. I heard there was a mayor in Frenctown who has a nice car. They also say he was sympathetic to the Germans"" Stone gets the car, which is at a place similar to a standard strong house or enemy position in games, finds proof the guy was collaborating, kills him, drives the car back, meets Betty Grable and she gives him her handkerchief with her lip prints in lipstick on it.\n\nStone is also acquiring stuff along the way. Items he picks up in his missions. He can trade these things through the game to supply clerks for ammo and weapons. He trades Bob Hope's fedora for a new tommy gun. Trades a German Luger for gun upgrades to a machinist (more about guns and gear below). \n\nStone can also brush up against some of the bigger historical personages in cutscenes. Roosevelt, Churchill, Stalin, Patton, Montgomery, Rommel, etc. \n\nStone can also have missions including historical soldiers of note. Audie Murphy, Charles Coward, Eileen Nearne, Matt Urban, Tommy MacPherson, Lyudmila Pavlichencko (the female Russian sniper with over 300 confirmed kills).\n\nStone can meet and work with other military units of note in his role.\n\nThe 442 Infantry Division. An all Japanese American unit that fought ferociously but suffered losses at rates to be nicknamed the Purple Heart Battalion. Especially their work in the Vosges Mountains.\n\nThe 92 Infantry Division. All African American unit nicknamed the buffalo soldiers. Only African American unit sent into combat in ww2. \n\nThe 4th Signal Company, 4th Infantry Division, and their native American code talkers. From the D-Day landings at Normandy in June 1944, to the liberation of Paris and the Battle of the Bulge, they kept the lines of communications secure\n\nThrough the interactions of Stone across the spectrum of characters (which also would include much more from the allied nations than I have mentioned so far) we see a bigger picture of the people of all nations, races, colors, and genders that fought the war.\n\nYou’ve also got the music and language of the time in all this. The slang and jargon of the military and all the 'it was fubar' type stuff.\n\nPlus there is all the gear and uniforms of ww2 involved. The uniforms and guns so familiar to all of us through popular culture like movies, books, games, etc. Stone looking sharp AF in an American airborne uniform with a British Sten around his shoulder, Russian boots, American helmet. \n\nThrough his missions, and being unattached to any one unit where a uniform is required, Stone can obtain and mix and match any number of uniforms and weaponry found in the areas he sees action in. This could be simply cosmetic or can give ability advantages. \n\nStone could have the option to develop certain skills as he finds relics and changes gear. To use FPS terminology, is he going to rush and run and gun with an SMG, mid range beast with rifles and LMGs, long range assassin type with sniper rifles? So if you want to play run and gun you may favor an SMG like a sten, Thompson, ppsh, MP40. Mid range beast would have the options of M1 Garand, BAR, STG44, Lee Enfield for rifles or LMGs like Browning 30cal, Vickers, MG42. If sniping then different sniper rifles. \n\nThe gear Stone gets can add strength to certain play styles. Airborne boots add to quickness and stealth for rushing run and gun, Russian combat boots add hit point reduction for midrange gun battles, British tanker boots provide stability and reduce muzzle sway for sniping. Whether for cosmetics or gameplay this allows personalization of Stone which makes him more personal to us. \n\nThat it very simplified. Obviously there are people who do this for a living that could expand on all this, and probably correct many errors so far. I’m currently replaying AC Odyssey (and liking it, don’t judge) as I wait for AC Valhalla. I just can’t help but imagine how incredible the same concept applied to WW2 would be. \n\nAll the locations, history, characters, stories, weapons, uniforms, music, of that era in an exploratory and playable world. Sooner or later it’s got to be time to give WW2 the game it’s due. I’d be willing to buy the game if someone was willing to make it."

lxji0u,[VR] 3rd person 3v3 ATLA and LoK pro bending game,"For those unfamiliar with the Avatar series, it mixes martial arts with manipulation of the elements of earth, fire, water, and air.  In the sequel, Legend of Korra, [pro bending is made into a sport](https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Pro-bending), in which teams of three compete on a hexagonal field with three zones on each side, attempting to push their foes back over the three minute time period, or to ring them out off the edge.  \n\nThe idea is to translate that same 3v3 on a 3 minute timer and 3 zones for each team, with the game acting as something between Blaston and Thrill of the Fight.  Stylistically a lot of inspiration will be drawn from Shifu and Absolver with regard to a lo-fi aesthetic which features dynamic and procedural martial arts animation best befitting the contextual interactions occurring, though obviously the visual style of the Avatar shows themselves will be the largest influence.   \n\nPlayers can choose their elements, which will impact how they play- earthbenders will throw punches to launch discs and arc their trajectories with the swings of their arms, firebenders jabbing out jets of flame, waterbenders slicing out with their water whips.  Your body ducking to the side will see your avatar acrobatically launching themselves horizontally dodging out of the way, your stick controlling their roaming around the arena.  \n\nThe third person perspective will let you see you and your teammates position in the arena, able to turn your view to track threats and immerse yourself in the space.  You can guard against attacks, dodge them, match them with your own to parry them, or simply go on the offensive yourself.  Like in the show, earthbenders will draw their discs from the 21 holes around the stage, waterbenders drawing from the grates between zones, and firebenders their own energy reserves.  \n\nAsset wise, it’s a single hexagonal stage broken into six zones, you have three projectile sets, player avatars for each faction and gender, and an animation call system which approximates player movement into the third person martial arts motions for attacks (this has been done in projects like Overgrowth and there are publicly available resources for procedural animation to align with player input.)"

lxi0t4,[Dream] This literally came to me in a dream,"Last night, I dreamed about a space combat sim that doesn't exist. It's not super original, in fact my subconscious seems to have basically ripped-off *The Expanse*, but if a game idea comes to you in a dream, I feel like you are obliged to post it somewhere.\n\nBasically, every ship has two main kinds of weapons, and two main kinds of defences. Weapons are laser cannons and missiles. Defences are point-defence lasers and shields.\n\nPoint defence lasers shoot down missiles. So if you fire a single missile at an undamaged ship, it won't get through. But if you fire several volleys of say, 4 missiles each, the defences will be overwhelmed and at least one missile might get through.\n\nHowever, you can use your laser cannons to disable the enemy's defensive lasers first, which means it's easier to get a missile through. Point-defence lasers have a limited firing cone, so if you disable an enemy's port-aft laser, you'll want to make sure your missile comes from the same angle. A capital ship would have dozens of defensive lasers, whereas a fighter might just have 2-4.\n\nShields would work basically how you expect shields to work, they soak up damage, regenerate slowly, and you need to disable them before you can destroy the ship. But there are separate shield sections, so a ship might have lost shields in one area, but still have full shields elsewhere.\n\nIn my dream, you have a wormhole in your ship which connects you back to your base, so that you have infinite missiles and energy, and if your ship is about to be destroyed, you ""eject"" down the wormhole back to safety. But I don't think that's a particularly good gameplay mechanic. Maybe it's something you could have during the early levels, and then that connection is cut-off later in the game, to ramp up the challenge."

lxeli9,Underwater city builder,"The basics would be really run of the mill, you need create a barrier to keep oxygen in, as well as a system to get oxygen in and CO2 out do the town doesn't suffocate, you need filtration systems to make the water both fresh and clean, food systems, and power.\n\nPretty average city builder with the twist of having to deal with oxygen\n\nBut at the same time while dealing with all that stuff you also have to deal with pollution seeping into the ocean around you, as well as the displacement of wild life.  My idea is that there'd be many paths you can take. \n\nYou can be an angel and develop a full (and expensive) recycling plan and in late game be completely self reliant with no excess generated garbage. Or you can be a complete asswipe and just chuck it into the ocean leaving it for the sea turtles and jellyfish to die in your capital greed\n\nWith food you can either develop safe hatcheries, ranches, and farms, or you can hunt the whales and sharks to extinction\n\nYou can go full Scrooge McDuck and create oil rigs that generate a ton of cash but have a chance of spilling into the ocean, with factories spewing toxic chemicals and gases, and so on and so forth\n\nAdditionally I think there's a lot of way to make the game more creatively appealing, like maps next to/in trenches, beside underwater volcanoes, in kelp forests etc. One of my biggest issues with Surviving Mars is that you have this super cool world, but everything you build looks identical because everything's on a grid. My idea is that the ""bubbles"" will work more fluidly, all the player has to do is mark where the glass would go and close it in.\n\nI also think it would be a fun idea if in the research part of it to unlock stuff one of the final researches would be to create the ability to literally turn your citizens into merpeople. I think it would be fun, but I can see why people would hate it for being too unrealistic or something\n\nIdk, maybe it's something that only sounds cool to me lol, what do you guys think?

lxd1u9,Suffer for Television!,"Summerized: A 2D, action packed, bullet hell.\n\nLore: Suffer for Television (SFT) is staged somewhere in the future (2037 - 2045) and people are craving violence. Now anyone can sign up, not many are chosen however. SFT only hires people who wont make it, because the prizes are big. If you complete all 10 arenas, you earn 10 billion dollars! And billions of people tune in to see people get shot, sliced in two, crushed, and even disolved! Not many make it out alive. And if they do, they get pentilized for anything, which lowers their cash and causes them to over all be disqualified!\n\nMechanics: the player runs around a few rooms trying to reach the boss room. They must stand in the middle for the enemies to begin spawning. Here are the few rooms. \n\nSimple room: a small 7 by 5 room. Doors open up sending out simple enemies which dont do much damage but when in groups are fatal. Some small groups of bladed enemies are released but they are weaker than simple enemies.\n\nLarge room: 10 by 12 room with turrents that come out of the floor to attack the player. There are two doors on each wall which send out several enemies at once. These rooms only spawn at Arena 3 - 10.\n\nBoss room: a hexagon shaped room which a elevator in the middle, stand in the middle to be sent into the boss pit. There it is much more open, you can no longer wall hug because there is a pit around walls, and you cant go back up the elevator once the battle has begun.\n\nRandom Exchange room: a small 3 x 2 room with a crack in the wall. A monster with long thin hands will hold out it's hand and wait for you to hand it a gun, perk, or just an item. The higher item, gun, or perk rarity, the better thing you will recieve.\n\nThe shop: another 3 x 2 room with a shop built into the wall. Through the steel window you can see guns, horse shoes, hand grenades, and a man inside the shop. Interacting with the man will bring up a shop screen and you'll have to buy something with the money you earned from killing the enemies in the previous room. First shop item: Shotgun, Assult rifle, pistol upgrade, bouncy bullets perk, motivational audience perk, and Death's Scythe shotgun (0.01% chance spawn. Only spawns in first shop).

lx34ct,"Shadow of the colossus-like, but, a few layers deeper","Hello guys, i'm new here so be gentle with me :D\n\nI've been watching some videos about SotC on youtube, and I was absolutely amazed and fascinated with that game. The level of wonder it gave the players is astounding. The community gathering to find the game's secrets and all that, it just gave me hope for such a game in the future.\n\nI would want to build a game that has that same awe inspiring personality, and at the same time keep the player engaged at all times. For example, BotW lacked what i would call, post-story. Sure, it has sooo many sidequests, but the Main plot is over and suddenly the game is just a sandbox. The core thing about BotW imo is the mystery, the discovery, the survivability, and Mainly the ""no clear objective"" (i mean, its quite clear, defeat ganon, but i guess you get what i'm saying).\n\nI would love if a game, after all the ""main"" plot, had some sidequests, that were Not just handed out, you had to search the world for them, and one of them, just one of them, would trigger a second ""Main"" plot, just as dense and long. This, but like, 6 layers deep. And finding how to get to the next layer would be very hard, but would reward the player with a lot of content. Also, the fewer dialogues, the better. Let the player have that dialogue, or rather, monologue, and make him/herself the questions, and put the puzzle pieces together.\n\nInstead of being rewarded with common loot, or something like that, the reward would be a subtle hint that something in the world is now accessible to visit and discover.\n\nThis could have something to do with the game's mechanics, or day night cycle, or any other quirk of the game, but it would mean the player would be motivated to find those places and interact with them to see what happened.\n\nAlso, the world of the game could have very subtle plot developments like after you completed a part of the plot, a character went missing, or you would lose some power you had, but the game Wouldnt tell you that. you'd have to find it yourself.\n\nImagine the reward the player would feel knowing that even after 200 hours of exploring, he'd find a hint, a piece of paper on a bottle on a river, that held more questions than answers, but led the player somewhere he already visited.Imagine he visits the place, and finds almost everything the same, except one very particular thing, like once in that town or village, after a certain plot point, the night wouldnt end until you completed the quest.Imagine after 100 hours or so of content, you are awarded a new mechanic like being able to breathe underwater, so it's explorable, or you get to move completely silent, or withstand very extreme temperatures, or even being able to understand a new language, the same language that was on a few papers you picked up along the ride, which you couldnt decipher and could only look at the pictures.\n\nMy goal would be, with as little narrative as possible, alter the plot as much as possible. Make it so that after the player finds a new mechanic, or way of interacting with the world, the world is virtually a new one to be explored, and a new adventure (with ties to the first one) can begin. Some of these ""roadblocks"" would be like BotW: Landscape, Climate, Weather, (maybe) monsters, but a threat of something you can't pinpoint would be much more effective than a few orcs, for example.Imagine that once you encountered an area, previously told in scriptures engraved in stone, or the like, you effectively became ""cursed"", but you wouldnt notice it immediately. You would apparently walk ever so slower, the colours would get ever so dimmer, and the music in the background would be ever so different, to the point you feel it's different, but can't tell it is. Imagine later, in that same area, your food no longer regenerates health, or your weapons change in colour, or some of them.\n\nThose small things are enough to make the player wonder, and try to find more about them.In my opinion, a good adventure game makes you wonder if youre going in the right direction, doesnt smack you in the face with information, or loot, or objectives. The objective is to explore. To find why you are there, and the mysteries of the world you're in.\n\nI am so sorry for the wall of text!!! I am just absolutely FULL of separate ideas i would love to see come to life, but am no programmer or game developer. I am merely a gamer :D\n\nPlease tell me what you think, if you would like to hear more, or let's have a talk about these ideas! Would love to chat about it!\n\nThank you so much for reading this far &lt;3"
lwyqop,Request: interesting gameplay mechanics in obscure games,"I want to know about what you guys think are interesting gameplay mechanics in games that are generally unknown.\n\nI often find myself repeatedly referencing a few games in this sub because many people post ideas that are really similar to these unknown games.\n\nOne example is ""majesty: the fantasy kingdom simulator,"" an RTS where you don't control where your units go or what they do. Your ""heroes"" instead choose their own actions. Maybe they pursue the bounty you placed on the evil lair and monsters. Maybe they sleep in the inn while a dragon destroys your castle.\n\nI'll update this post with more examples as I think of them.\n\nI see people posting similar concepts on this sub (an RTS with non-direct control of your units) and I wonder what games I'm missing. What awesome games/mechanics have already been done, but were simply lost to poor marketing or were too early for their time, or maybe even they were bad ideas, I want to know about those too."
lww7nv,Ridiculous gun fps,"So a game similar to halo, with team death match or free for all, and there is different guns littered all around the map. But.....the guns are completely bonkers and obsurd:\n\nPew pew banana - fires weak lasers then drops a peel any player can trip on when reloaded. (Starting gun?)\n\nDisco laser - has a disco ball on the end of it that just fires lasers in every direction.\n\nChicken grenade - throw a chicken, then the chicken randomly poops out grenades.\n\nDon't reload me mg - A machine gun with a 25 second reload animation that cant be undone.\n\nGlitch gun - Everytime you reload it shoots differently.\n\nSplash blaster - only deals splash damage, so hit something next to your target.\n\nWonder nades - grenades with a random fuse time ranging from 1 second - 2 minutes.\n\nOther ideas?"
lwu85l,Moon Nazi Fight,So basically Nazis take over the moon.\n \nChapter 1. War for the Moon.\n\n\nIt starts with a cutscene of a news paper:Big headline: NAZIS TAKE OVER THE MOON.

Revive and Restore.\n\n\nCutscene: Another newspaper\nHeadline: NAZIS FLEE FROM MOON AMERICANS RESTORING CIVILIAN SETTLEMENTS\n\n\nLVL 1 you have to go into an American mine to get minerals for the rebuilding of cities\n\nLVL 2 you have to rebuild a destroyed city\n\nLVL 3 you have to destroy a tiny suburban Nazi squad\n\nLVL 4 you have to rebuild more cities\n\nLVL 5 you are engaged by the remaining Nazis\n\nLVLs 6 and 7 you rebuild the last of the cities and imprison the last Nazis\n\nThat's Chapter 2 done.
lwq330,A Billiard game but the balls are emojis,So yeah a billiard game but the billiard balls has face and can emote like the one you see in your typical emojis. For example the cue ball can start as your simple smile emoji but when it was hit or rolled a couple of time it can transform into a puke emoji. The puke can affect the game. Maybe reduce the friction on that area.\n\nThat's the thing hovering in my head but don't know jack shit about coding lol
lwpf24,Tank of the party- a roguelite with no direct attack options,"You are the tank of your adventuring party, and you're relying on your wizard and rogue to kill the boss. The problem is, they both just died, and you don' have a weapon. \n\nThis concept is relatively simple- you are a tanky, hefty hero with no ability to directly harm your enemies. The gameplay would consist of a roguelite, with the character moving through a semi-endless number of rooms full of traps, enemies and danger in a similar style to Enter the Gungeon or Hades. However, unlike most roguelites, you don't have any direct way to kill your enemies.\n\nAs the tank of the party, you can use a variety of possible skills and abilities to *indirectly* kill monsters or stall them long enough to complete a room. For example, some ablities could include reflecting projectiles, knocking enemies back, stunning enemies, healing yourself, damaging enemies when they damage you, or turning enemies against each other. You could potentially kill enemies by knocking them into traps or causing them to hurt each other. The key design choice is that nothing you can do allows you to directly target and kill monsters. \n\nThe dungeon rooms you pass through would have objectives aside from just ""kill all the enemies"", in order to allow the player some flexibility in how they solve rooms. For instance, a room could have a timer to escape, or require you to activate several switches in order to progress. Success would be measured by rooms explored, not by enemies killed. \n\nI imagine the aesthetic as classic DnD-style fantasy with cartoon graphics. The whole thing would play as somewhat of a satire of roguelites and the role of a ""tank"" in a classic dungeon-crawling party. I thought this could be a unique twist on combat in a video game. \n\nThoughts?"
lwo3n5,40K Trench Manager: A defense game where your defenses kind of suck,"I feel like this would be a good idea for a mobile game.\n\nThis takes place in the Warhammer 40k universe (or not for licensing purposes wink wink). If you are not familiar with the universe it is a war-torn dystopian future full of super soldiers, monstrous horrors, literal daemons, high tech aliens and all sorts of horrors... oh and the imperial guard which is just dudes with shitty rifles and useless armor who serve as meat shields for the imperial guard's heavy weapons' and very impressive armored vehicles..\n\nThe imperial guard is often portrayed in video games and lore as a defensive army type, holding the line while taking horrific casualties against overwhelming foes. The leaders of the imperial guard are fascists who don't care about human life.\n\nThis got me thinking that it would be an interesting defense in depth game where the objective isn't to create perfect defenses to stop the enemy from inflicting casualties but rather a game where you completely expect your first, second or third line of defense to be wiped out. the challenge would be in making sure enough resources got to the front lines to keep al the guns firing and enough men got to the front line to plug the holes caused by casualties. You would be able to shift soldiers from one defensive position to another but doing so would be putting one zone at risk to protect another.\n\nYou can not win with quality, you must decide where and when to place your soldiers to maximize effectiveness. Different cover provides different cover bonuses like in dawn of war or company of heroes.\n\nOverall the entire feel of the game would be desperation, hoping you could produce enough supplier and manpower to halt a breakthrough while an endless horde of enemies bore down on you with increasing lethality."
lwl1ln,Roller coaster tycoon / Thrillville / Gary’s Mod playground type game (I’ll explain more in text),"So basically imagine a game that lets you facilitate and run some kind of huge amusement park, or even city if you want. And it has an interaction system similar to the thrillville games. But what I’m suggesting is a cerebral sandbox that allows you to be for all intents and purposes a god among mortals. You can play this game however you want, indifferent to people on a personal level and just intent on running whatever business or community you’re running, be benevolent, or be an absolute fuckin monster. You can have somebody put to death, you can kill everyone in fucked up ways, or you could do whatever you could to make everyone as happy as possible. If you want to isolate one NPC into a single room you can and you can fuck with them in all kinds of stupid ways. Basically I wanna hand the keys of a realistic enough reality to the player and tell them to be as stupidly evil or wholesomely good as they want."

lwj8yc,Town Building Rogue-like,"Inspiration for this would be something like Banished, Slay the Spire, and Hades.\n\nA town building game where the environment and resources are very difficult to survive in and thrive without additional help. Each season of the calendar year you get a small random deck of cards to play in order to help out/hurt your village (while you're also building it).\n\nExamples of cards:\n\n- 10 day rain comes down on your town (farmers don't have to water crops but unsheltered workers like lumberjacks are less productive outside)\n- animals have a great feeding, all animals produce 2x the meat for the next month (great for food coming from animals, not great for farmers because animals are eating the greenery and crops)\n\nNot all cards need pros and cons but similar to something like Slay the Spire, there should be cases where some runs you just get lucky with cards that have a bunch of synergy and your town is thriving.\n\nAs your towns progress through multiple playthroughs, unlock boosts similar to Slay the Spire relics and permanently upgrade different attributes about the town to make future playthroughs easier.\n\nI was also thinking about a mechanic to do ""something"" with cards that haven't been played yet at the end of the season. To add a little bit of a gamble, could be that a card that hasn't been played yet will be randomly chosen and played for the player at the end of the season with 3x the effect. For example, if a 10 day rain card hasn't been played by the end of the season, it could be randomly chosen to be played as a 3x (30 day) rain card. Something to add more chance/strategy to the transitions between seasons.\n\nEach ""winter season"" could be seen as a ""boss encounter"" as productivity would be low and food gathering would be pretty much nonexistent, relying only on stored food acquired from the previous year.\n\nThere would be trading and bartering of goods for other goods by traveling merchants or a trade house (building). That means that getting lucky with some cards that synergize with each other could boost a resource (ex: iron production is through the roof because of different cards) which could be traded for other resources (ex: wood to build new houses or burn for firewood, food to feed the townspeople, etc..).\n\nAs the town gets more complex and has more people, there is more demand for food and education to fuel more complex jobs (lumberjack -&gt; lumber mill -&gt; woodworker). The goal (as in Banished) is to not spread too thin while also progressing your town, which could be wiped out by a bad season of unlucky cards."

m4zepz,Medieval pacifist/genocide hack and slash game but all your slain enemies will come back in the last level as beefed up zombified versions of themselves,"So basically it’s a hack and slash game where you just kill everyone in your way(or try to avoid them) in an attempt to reach and kill the necromancer, when you reach him, he will ask a simple question, “do you know how many lives fell to your blade?” “Or have you lost count?” After which the battle will begin and swarms of the enemies you slayed will be approaching from both sides in a relatively slow but endless flow, the enemies will be boosted to resist your attacks a bit more and will only stop approaching when the number of zombies matches the number of enemies you killed, during the fight small text bubbles will appear on them repeating a single phrase, talking about a family member or how it hurts, if you don’t put them down a 2nd time then you will be overrun as they don’t come in waves\n\nAlternatively, you can go pacifist and avoid every single enemy(except bosses) and the necromancer will fight you head-on(while raising the occasional skeleton or zombie that’s significantly weaker than your zombified enemies)"
m4z4rl,WWII building sandbox,"ok, ok, this sounds weird, and would hurt historical accuracy, but would be fun, imagine using WWII tech to make a battleship to sail the seas, or make a tank to drive around, or even your own hodgepodge gun from parts like say the Mauser K98, M1 Garand, etc. there could be multiplayer where it would be much more ok to be less historically accurate. and a campaign that has you even at least make field modifications to say turning a M4 Sherman, into the Jumbo Sherman. of course, the actual creations of weapons are limited as you have different parts to choose from say, like a Mauser trigger group, or say the M1919. there could also be REAL hodgepodge guns like the Stinger machine gun. it sounds fun, (at least to me) because you are limited with WWII tech while having freedom of creating your own content, and it has a PVP mode where you can use your own weapons you made."

m4q85k,Norse mythology demigod game,"My idea is that you are Norse mythology demigod and at the beginning you get choose what you're the demigod of examples: fire, ice, extreme strength, earth, fear, blood, ect. And also choose gender and customize what your demigod looks like. Then you would be put into a huge Viking styled map with small vilages, big villages, deep forests with different Wildlife, and then there would be 4 huge titans that move around the map each of them almost the size of mountains there would be ice, magma, rock, tree ones and if you killed one they each have a glowing gem as their heart and when they die you can rip it out you get much more powerful and if you collect all of them you would almost have the power of a god. Another thing would be that you can steal from villages and kill villagers to get money to pay smiths to forge better armor and weapons. but if you do you will be considered an evil demigod if don't do anything you will be a neutral demigod if you save people from animals or Norse mythology monsters you will be a heroic demigod."

m4lopk,Ender's Game Vr (Idea to inspire you),"I'm not a game developer or anything so this is more of something to give people ideas.\n\nBasically, the game would be based on the no gravity battle room of the Novel to Movie, Enders Game(General Layout is seen here [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3E9TWmE3dfI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3E9TWmE3dfI).) A VR game called Echo Vr has a similar layout and idea, but they use frisbees to score and there isn't much of a PVP element as in the book and movie. \n\nThe people in the battle room use ""Stars"" or obstacles to moving around the room, all the while using a ""laser"" pistol that when fired depending on where they are hit will immobilize them. EX: Hit in leg cant move leg; Same with arm; Chest completely immobilize them. Depending on the size of the room, there could be up to 40 v 40 battles, and like in the book, one commander on each team who could group people into different squads/platoon. \n\nI think that it would be possible and has the potential to become really popular.  If it is well enough designed, you could eventually develop factions as seen in the show. This means that these factions could have battles, leaderboard standing, etc. The only issue I see with it is the fact that it could possibly be copyright strikes but I doubt they would mind free publicity.\n\nTo people like me who loved the book and movie, this would absolutely make our year if someone tried to recreate it.  \n\n#"
m4jecn,Anyone got any simple but fun online game ideas?,
m4hzn2,A horror mystery game where the story events changes based on how you solve the puzzles,"**Genre**: Mystery, Horror, Puzzle  \n**Style**: 2D\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy idea of how the overall mechanics work in the first part:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe game starts with a black screen and voices of people arguing in the background. After a few seconds the protagonist wakes up, sitting on a bench in a train/metro station. Then you get to control him and explore the station.\n\nThere are a few people in the station. Right beside you there is this old lady reading a book while crying, a few meters away some drunk dude is singing and if you go to the other side you find someone taking pictures of a wall graffiti with a polaroid camera. Then if you go back to where you woke up you see that the drunk dude has passed out and the old lady is gone but her book is on the bench with two photos on the ground.\n\nYou pick up the book and there is only one page that has text written on it. It's about someone getting murdered in a train/metro station and on the next page there are 4 empty places for photos. Then you pick up the photos. They are photos of a man with a blurry face (kinda like [this](https://wjlta.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/blurred_face.jpg)). In the first photo the blurry face man is holding a knife and the the second one is him rushing towards the camera. Then you place the photos on the empty spots on the second page of the book. A few seconds later the drunk man gets up and his face gets blurry. Then he pulls out a knife and stabs you a couple of times then throws the knife away.\n\nAfter dying you wake up in the station again but it's different now. The exits are closed, there are police yellow tapes around you and there is a pool of blood where you died. You see the same old lady from before, reading the book but this time she seems happy. You ask her who she is but she says you'll get answers if you find the other photos and complete the story. Now you have to search around the station. You find the first picture in the pool of blood which you have to wash it in the bathroom. When you wash it it's a close up shot of someone getting stabbed. Then if you go to the part where the wall graffiti was you'll see that instead of the graffiti it's a painting of the blurry face man throwing the knife away. Then you have to search around the station and find the polaroid camera in order to take a picture of the painting. When you are done with all of that you go back to find the old lady. She's gone again but the book is still there. You pick up the book and start placing the photos.\n\nThis time you have to change the order a bit if you want to survive, so you put the photos in this order:  \n1- Man holding a knife  \n2- Man throwing the knife  \n3- Man rushing towards the camera  \n4- Someone getting stabbed\n\nAfter placing all 4 photos you go back to the exact moment the blurry face man appeared. This time he pulls out the knife then throws it at you but misses. You pick up the knife while he's rushing towards you. He tries to strangle you but you stab him in self defense. He starts bleeding but keeps strangling you until you pass out. Then you wake up in the hospital.\n\nI'll think of the hospital part and add more mechanics if you guys think it's a decent game idea."

m4dsd9,A VR game about having a Thor's Hammer,"Or a trident or a controllable boomerang or something like that\n\nI'm thinking it would be a good idea since it's a pretty simple mechanic for implementing on VR, but i have no idea how VR works so i might be wrong\n\nSo you're standing in place and you can throw the hammer, it flies in the direction where you're pointing with your hand, and you can use the buttons on the controller to make it fly closer or farther away from you. it doesn't immediately go to the place where you tell it to,but flies there kinda like a RC plane.\n\nI think  the skill of controlling it would be easy to learn but hard to master, and you would have to worry about the enemies approaching you as well as the ones farther away.\n\nIdk I'm currently learning programming but i don't really know where I'm gonna go with it, so maybe one day I will be able to make it"
m4bdc5,A Bunch of Half-Baked Ideas,"Over the years I've accumulated quite a few game ideas that I never developed very far, for any number of reasons. I don't claim that any of them are terribly original or haven't been done before. I've decided to just dump them here in case anyone wants to take a run at them. Without further ado:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Cloud Harvest** \- Consume clouds but don't consume too many or they won't grow back. Could replace clouds with trees or similar. Maybe add some special non-renewables. Environmental theme.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Feline Space Program** \- Manage a space program run by Internet cats. Cats have overrun the planet and are using humans to explore space – against their will. Humans say amusing things to their former pets as they are launched into space to accomplish certain goals. Game is a simple 2D space sim – what makes it stand apart is humor, and cats. Cat images are taken from the Internet and cropped accordingly, and a fishbowl helmet or other hats are placed on the images. The cats appear on screen to assign missions and provide commentary, or just insult their former owners. They have silly motives, like using the Moon as a giant litter box, or searching for the source of the elusive Red Bugs. Players can launch robot probes or capsules with human test pilots and have to complete randomly-assigned missions of increasing difficulty. “Boss” levels will involve especially challenging or significant story missions with feline astronauts. The player is presented with cartoon representations of the Earth and Moon. Controls are simple: you control a space gun on the surface of the Earth and can control angle and power. As you complete objectives, your gun becomes more powerful. Later levels will allow you to do limited mid-course corrections, simplified to a great degree (you might be able to perform a single correction of predetermined power and get to choose direction, or launch a landing craft from a mothership at the right time, however you would not be able to control the landing craft).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**NetQuack** \- basically a duck-themed take on NetHack. Duck-based roguelike with procedurally-generated wetlands – duck ponds of various shapes and sizes joined by streams.\n\nEat fish (either appear as silhouettes in the water or must be “duck-sensed” – like nethack search), find mates, defend against rivals, don’t get shot, avoid bears.\n\nPermadeath. Human predator shoots as you approach decoy indistinguishable from mate. Directional sound indicates direction of mate/decoy. May be several per level (wetland).\n\nTile types: lily pads, reeds, tall grass, short grass, rock, water, logs, trees, boat.\n\nPredators: wolves, bears, foxes, big fish, “large aquatic predators”, humans, peregrine falcons\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Simyphus (Sisyphus Simulator)** \- Push a boulder up a hill! Boulder rolls back down once it gets to the top. If you stop moving, the character will start to lean against the boulder with his/her back and it will start to push you back down – eventually you will no longer be able to hold it, and the boulder rolls back down. Stamina bar wears down as you push – stopping doesn’t use stamina, and you start with enough to make it to the top. Pushing up always uses stamina, so losing ground can mean not being able to make it to the top. Player is rewarded with demotivational quotes and new skins for boulders, new environments, all feature a slope and background. Slopes may vary slightly at random intervals and you will occasionally have to push the boulder over small rocks on the ground. You can never actually win the game, but you can continue to get achievements for sticking with it – meaningless tokens that don’t actually get you anywhere. Greater inclines require more stamina.\n\nWill have to run an algorithm to make sure the player always starts with enough stamina to reach the top, given solid determination (i.e., continually pushing against the boulder without sliding backwards.\n\nGame is a commentary on the pointlessness of many tasks, including many games. A subtitle will intermittently taunt the player, asking them if they want a refreshing beverage, or berating them, telling them that it’s pointless, tell them they should take a break or otherwise badger. Of course the game won’t let you pause. And a mechanism prevents you from holding down the button with something, as it will spontaneously prompt you to press and alternate button to push. Holding down both buttons is the same as not pushing. Switches happen at random.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Suborbital** \- Manage a fleet of suborbital liners. Tank wars meets KSP.

m49e65,Appartment ownership in Cyberpunk city (ideas?),"Ok so my game will be based on the theme of cyberpunk and folklore (ghosts, etc).\n\nI have created a large city that is layered in rings around the dense centre. Skyscrapers &gt; Large buildings &gt; Small buildings &gt; City wall &gt; Forest and tents (homeless)\n\nDuring the game the player will buy an apartment either inside the city walls or outside, depending on what they can afford. Outside will be dangers because of ghosts in the forest.\n\nI'm curious to get some extra ideas, especially regarding what the player might do in/outside the city. The game will most likely be top down and so I'm currently thinking managing (not building) the city.\n\nOne of my ideas is each building is regularly updated with missions (e.g. make sushi or build robot), however I'm not sure clicking button to do missions will be much fun(?)"
m46yss,Detailed City Transport Manager,"**Why?**  \nSince Cities in Motion 1 and 2 there weren't any transport games that dealt with city transport only.  \nThere weren't any transport games that dealt with the managing part in detail - mostly you could just build and modify lines.\n\n**Basic version**  \nYou have a city's tram network with trams and passangers at the start. You can manage the following aspects:  \n\- perfect the lines: you can create and modify line that benefit your passangers better  \n\- experience the rush hour: instead of years you have days, hours and minutes  \n\- vehicle maintenance: you have to deal with their condition, if you don't, they can break down  \n\- vehicle reconstruction: you can change their engines to improve their condition and performance, you can change their interior to became more attractive  \n\- track types: you can have older or newer track types with for difference repair price and speed limits  \n\- track maintenance: you have to deal with their condition and you have repair or replace them in real time: small repair can be done at night, for bigger replacements you have to order bus replacement and create diversions  \n\- workers: you can manage your workers' salary and working schedules, deal with their strikes  \n\- you can manage the ticket price, introduce new kinds of tickets  \n\- passanger happiness: lower ticket prices, attractive vehicles, faster tracks and vehicles, frequent service can give you bigger city funding\n\n**Levels / years**  \nAfter you are done or bored with your starting year, you can level up and go fast forward in time:  \n\- bigger parts of the map can be manageble  \n\- new residental, commercial or industrial areas grow near your lines  \n\- new kinds of vehicles and tracks aviable  \n\- and of course you have to deal with your older vehicles and tracks\n\nThe game should be able to simulate bigger cities because managing a few lines and 20 vehicles isn't very interesting. This means that AI car traffic can't be done in the game and there aren't any traffic jams. Therefore I think this game start around 1900 and end 1960 in western europeans cities and 1980 in eastern european cities.\n\n**Pro version**  \nLater the game could be improved to:  \n\- have buses, undergrounds, trolleybuses with new kinds of features  \n\- have the option of building tracks to build new lines and cover bigger parts of the city\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think this game shouldn't be about looks and graphics - but rather about never-seen-before detailed management of a city transport company. This level of detail and the rush hour was never done before in any transport game. I hope someone likes this idea.\n\nI'm not a programmer or a designer - I wish I could make this game by myself. But I work as a transport manager myself, so I can help during the development of the game. If there's serious interest in my idea please let me know  - maybe we can work something out."

The sim parts are introduced slowly throughout the game, with it finally coming in full force by the 3rd act when you become an indie dev and have to manage a whole company. And despite you changing jobs a few times, there will still be characters that remain important to the plot the whole way through, those being the protagonist themselves, a specific annoying coworker that seems to follow you to every new job - eventually becoming your boss, then getting fired as you start your indie team and being the first employee you hire - and the protagonist's true companions, who support you every step of the way."

m413fn,The world of MAJBI,"The year is 2064. Earth is relatively the same as modern day. The player is dropped into the first full dive vrmmorpg. The player has to complete quests and kill enemies to start an empire. All wealth earned goes directly into growing the players nation. Most of the parts of building a nation are done for the player by his 4 npc generals. There are various items and loot for the player to grow with as they level and relationships with surrounding nations are made through negotiations and a showcase of strength. A giant expansive open world to enjoy with unique dungeons and monsters. Basically breath of the wild but with nation building at its core. MAJBI is an acronym for the 5 leaders of the Five Star corporation which launched the game. Madeline, Anaheim, Jackson, Bobbie, and the main character Izaak. Just a big story I've been writing that I think is just a great game concept"
m40y2k,A resource based planetary colonization game,"This is a top down building game like sim City where the player is tasked with preparing a barren planet for colonization. The player will get regular deliveries from their home world, but will have to setup mining and refinement facilities on the new planet to make any real progress. \n\nThe planet will have deposits of ice, minerals and metals that can be extracted and refined to make the basic building blocks of your future colony. The player's first job will be to find where these deposits are by landing drones on the surface. Once a deposit is found the player can land a harvesting facility on it to extract a targeted mineral. The useful things the player needs like rocket fuel, concrete, steel, and glass can only be manufactured with a combination of several minerals. \n\nInitially the player will have to import rocket fuel from their home world to operate the landers which bring stuff down to the planet, however if some of the minerals needed for rocket fuel can be found on planet the player can choose to import only the refined minerals they are missing for the rocket fuel formula and manufacture the rocket fuel in orbit. Once the player can extract all the minerals needed for rocket fuel locally they can land a fuel refinery on the planet and set up some sort of transportation infrastructure to get the minerals from their harvesters to the refinery.\n\nSuch transportation infrastructure will start out as automated off road haulers driving between the stations. But can be upgraded to paved roads, rail lines, and eventually pipelines. Each step up will require Concrete and Steel. Initially Concrete and Steel can be imported from the home world, but as mineral deposits are discovered and harvested these elements too can be created locally.\n\nThe ultimate goal will be to setup habitation domes which require large quantities of Concrete, Steel, and other building materials. The game ends when enough habitation domes have been built to establish a self sustaining colony."
m3yiny,Morlock Evolution: A game based on the book “The Time Machine”,"Feel free to use this idea.\n\nThe Time Machine is a science fiction novel by H. G. Wells, published in 1895. My game idea is based on the Morlocks, which are a fictional race in this book.  The game would start in the year 2050, when a cataclysmic disaster renders the surface of the Earth almost unlivable.  You control the underground civilization, which consists of those that chose to live underground.  The people there survive off of machines that give them what they need to live, and their world is hermetically sealed off from the surface.  \n\n\nThe game starts in the year 2050 and ends in the year 802,701 when the time traveler arrives.  The game should last for 20 hours, which means that about 11 years pass every second.  Your people would originally be human, and over time they very slowly evolve into Morlocks. They should be given a detailed history as time progresses.  Essentially, it’s a civilization management game where you must produce food, gather resources, expand your underground empire, research tech improvements, and keep your people happy. After a few hundred thousand years, they begin traveling to the surface for food, and later on they start consuming the Eloi, since they see them as another species by then.\n\nIn the movie, the time traveler turns his time machine into a bomb and destroys the Morlocks. He attempts to do this in the game too.  If he succeeds, then you lose. If you defeat him, then the game goes on until you build a space ship to begin colonizing the cosmos."
m3xmzu,Pick Your Poison,"Essentially, this is a Dark Souls type game where you are extremely weak - You do little damage with your attacks and just a few attacks from the enemies will kill you - but you have tons of poisons at your disposal. \n\nSo, every fight consists of you deciding which poisons to use, poisoning the enemies through various means, and then dodging and blocking all their attacks until they die from the poison - while also re-poisoning them when the poison effects wear off.\n\nYou would have to make the poisons yourself by collecting the ingredients and then doing a small mini game to make the poisons. You would also need to acquire the blades, arrows, and bombs that you would apply the poisons to, by either making them yourself or buying them.\n\nThere would a strategy element to picking your poisons. Weaker poisons could be made much easier, while you’d have to go out of your way to acquire ingredients for more powerful poisons. Different poisons could have different trade-offs, like a poison that does less damage per second but slows down the enemies’ attacks. Poisons also come in different colors, with poisons of different colors being able to stack on top of each other. It’s also possible for you to be poisoned yourself by enemies or your own bombs, so you need to have the proper equipment and some antidotes ready if you want to be safe.\n\nThe story is pretty simple. There’s some great evil that’s going to destroy everything and you are one of the heroes that has set off to save the world. You were relentlessly mocked for specializing in poisons, with people pointing out how ineffective poisons are against monsters and how dependent poison specialists are on the rest of the party, but you doubled down and decided not only to save the world using your poisons but to do it completely alone."
m3xddf,Until The War Starts,10 teams of 4 adventurers are dropped into a world in ruin. Every town is completely empty and mostly in rubble. The wilderness is still plentiful so rebuilding is possible. Every citizen of this world are trapped in various dungeons and have to be recovered. The adventures job is to rebuild society before 15 days is up. Each team will make a nation with as many people as they can recover. The gods will grace them with an army proportionate to the size of the people. So the more dungeons you conquer the bigger your army. But you also have to build houses for every citizen or they wont be counted by the gods. The gods also ban hurting other adventurers. There has to be balance between conquering dungeons and creating a nation before 15 true days are up. After the night of the 15th day an all out war between the 10 nations breaks out to decide the ultimate nation. Once there is only 1 kingdom left the have to defend the last of humanity from waves of demonic chaos. The worlds fate will be decided by the adventures to decide if the world lives or dies. I imagine the Forest for the construction pieces. Maybe a mix between every war game ever and call of duty zombies for combat and the waves of chaos.

m3p88a,Mobaish type game - Singer Wars,"Singer Wars will take real life singer and give their music powers. \n\nGame play:  \nThe game will be a 6vs6. The map will be a circle-ish area will points at random spots across the map. The point of the game is to get rid of all the enemies ""notes"" or points. At the start of the game a team can have a total of 120 ""notes"". The points across the map will work as respawners and note takers. If you hold a point (standing on the point and nobody is contesting) the enemy will lose 1 point per second. If you knock out an enemy you take 10 points from the enemy and replenish you points. When you get knocked out you will turn into music notes and start floating toward a nearby point (thinking about calling them stages). \n\nCharacters:  \nThe characters will be real life singer (with their permission of course). Each character/singer will have multple move sets based off their real life songs. Each move set will have 3 normal abilities and a Ult. At the start of the game when your in character select you can go ahead and choose what song you want to use, after that you can lock in and place a talent point into an ability.  Im gonna give an example on what i mean:\n\nAva Max:\n\nMY head &amp; My Heart   \nAbility 1 - Tiny violin: Ava sings the lyric and a violin apears in target location getting cut putting out a ear screeching sound dealing damage and slowing targets affected.  \nAbility 2 -   \nAbility 3 -   \nULT - \n\nKings &amp; Queens  \nAbility 1 -   \nability 2 -   \nability 3 -   \nULT - \n\nSweet but psycho   \nAbility 1 -   \nAbility 2 -  \nAbility 3 -   \nULT - \n\nDuring singer select you can choose 1 song and it will change the way you play your character. Plus while the singer is still coming out with songs the character in game will also evolve song wise."

m3ksuq,Survival RPG,"Basically a traditional rpg where you have to survive on an island it’s kind’ve Minecraft/Monster Hunter , you start up as a base guy who can’t do much but there’s monsters on the island a mine and a forest you pick up materials for weapons/items and armor and fight monsters and harvest most of the materials. You explore tougher areas with tougher monsters and better materials. No main story but a lot of side missions.\n\nSounds generic so far but there’s some extra ideas to make this feel more unique \n\nNo instant health, you gotta kill monsters and gather the meat to be cooked.\n\nYou can study/observe monsters to gain new skills learn special spells and techniques from them,\n\nYou can raise stats with stat points from every level. \n\nMagic is a skill/craft tree where you have to learn it from studying opponents and grant yourself magical blood by injecting materials into you.\n\nYou find castaways to join your party \n\nWith this you can essentially create endless \npossibilities and classes for your characters \n\nIt’s a simple idea that could make for a fun game.

You research new equipment of your choice, maybe even try something experimental.\n\nYou decide which equipment is needed, at what time, at what place and is it either too much or little. You design the soldier's gear and various specialites, the field infirmary, the field kitchen and what vehicles to use. Not tanks or artillery, trucks tasked with hauling all that stuff around.\n\nWhat equipment you use and how much of it will affect how the war goes. Give too little and they can't fight, give too much and they're overburdened,give too old and thet out-classed, let them starve and they don't have energy, give a lot food and it'll spoil thus affecting funds, give improper clothing and they'll freeze/burn up. You get the picture, give the correct stuff and you'll succeed."
m3d8xq,Victorian Magical Game Idea???,"So I’ve basically had this game idea since like middle school, and it’s definitely progressed so much from where it was. Let’s me explain where my thought process is rn:\n\nThe protagonist and the character you play as Juniper, who has the power to manipulate fire, water, air, and earth. She’s the descendant of a newly abandoned culture and was blessed with her powers by the gods in order to bring it back (kinda like Jesus). The culture she comes from is hereditary to white hair, which is now considered a token of misfortune. So you face much prejudice throughout the game for your looks. But over the course of the game, you learn ways to use your powers in a more useful way (the ability to freeze water and manipulate blood, the ability to move the direction of wind or create it and suck out all the air out of peoples lungs, create man holes or ravines for your enemies to fall in, and to potentially shoot fireballs out of thin air and light entire cities if willing).\n\nEconomically, I’m trying to be as realistic as possible. There will be racism and that is something you will have to triumph throughout the game. You can either be on the side of fighting back against stigmas or helping create them along the way. NPCs will refuse to associate with you since you are of different culture and will sometimes refuse business. Over the course of the game, some will realize the errors of their ways and become better, others won’t. And, it all depends on how you dress and how the public see you. Dress more practical and rugged, expect more upper class people to belittle you (don’t worry you can kill as many bigots as you please and you can loot em for $$$), dress more high fashion and expect more special treatment from others and beggars trying to feed families.\n\nYour reputation will exceed you. Depending on your moral standpoint throughout the game, quests will be built by NPCs using you as an outlet for their desires. Example: if you’re more good, expect people wanting you to spread kindness to try and lighten society. More evil, corrupt politicians or bandits will make you do their dirty work and have you run errands. Now you can accept any quests, but evil people usually don’t go for the hood guy so you’ll have to dig to find em.\n\nThere will be LGBTQ+ representation. In fact, your parents are a lovely gay couple who support your dream of finding your lost culture and saving the world. You (Juniper) are a bisexual young woman who has had a few summer flings in the past who may or may not make a come back into your life. Along the way, two lesbians will join your party and they will have a slow burn relationship so it’s your job to help both of them out by helping them try to break out of their lovesick shy tactics. If you click on NPCs profiles it will tell you their sexual orientation, so be careful of who you try to woo in case you try to woo a gay man :/.\n\nNow onto the world. I’m still trying to pin point what era I want this game is set in. I’m leaning more towards a more Victorian/ Steam Punk vibe. There will be cities and towns who are not yet up to the status quo of the “modern” technology, and there will be cities who have entirely embraced it. There will also be strange creatures, such as the pigrat (it lives up to its name), the catcoon, and the frogoat. I’ll figure out better names for the creatures as I come along. There will be many different kinds of biomes, plains, deserts, mountains, dead lands, and some biomes that have yet to be explored. You can explore as much as you want! I intend on making this a very large world, where you can ride horses or trains, maybe set sail across the ocean and have fun with pirates and such.\n\nFinally, the objective and main point in the game. Since you’re practically the Jesus of your religion, you have a mission to save it. Given at birth, a crystal with the connection to a lost goddess. She helps aid you along your journey, helping you find more crystals of the lost gods. there will be 5 in total. The Water Crystal (Goddess of the Sea and Rivers), The Ember Crystal (Goddess of War and Fire), The Heartstring Crystal (The Divine of Love and Fertility), The Earth Crystal (God of Land and Harvest, and The Breeze Crystal (God of Air and Weather). You must unite all the crystals together again, and then the unity of the world will be once more. However, the villain of this story is a power hungry socialite who proclaims he can bring down nations within hours. Over the coarse of time, he manages to become Emperor of one of the nations. It’s a race against time between you two as he tries to use them for ultimate power of the gods in his hands.\n\nI am in no way near close to bringing this idea to life yet, so I was hoping that I could branch out and get more ideas! I’m currently studying video game design, so it will be great to see some advice over the next few years. If you have any recommendations or questions, I would love to hear em!"
m3cjbg,Dead rising but as a top down shooter with roguelike elements,"Could also be a mix of gungeon but i haven't played the game yet sadly.\n\nThere will be a time limit for each day, a day time and a night time, at morning the player has to go around the map and gather weapons, the zombies during the night at almost immobile except for some special enemies but once it becomes night, the pace becomes a horde based shooter where you have to either prepare for the night to survive the horde and get better loot or just get to the safe zone as quick and safe as you could.\n\nThere's also a big mechanic (because the game felt like atomicrops but half the content so i gotta be more unique) where whenever you're hit by the special enemies, your ""curse gauge"" fills, the curse gauge will grant the player a curse in proportion to how much the gauge is filled, but the player can either convert these curses to blessings which acts as buffs or succumb to them and transform into special sub-classes thing that gives big bonuses but also negatives.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is the least i can say about the idea, i have a google doc that says more about it + the intended artstyle, but i consider myself an amateur artist so i can't be the most reliable when it comes to creating a style: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b2\_Tuloc08eTJvg8GFiPl7bNKi8L7v-u9YSDAgDs5Ps/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b2_Tuloc08eTJvg8GFiPl7bNKi8L7v-u9YSDAgDs5Ps/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nThe playable characters are placeholders, since the full stats and things aren't really reality so i can't build upon anything. There's also some problems that i can't figure out what to do, like how to unlock characters and also what the permanent progression could be without just outright buffing the player."

m308tf,Recruiting,"I have started making video games. I have 3 concepts that are incredibly original and I think they the potential to be HUGELY popular. As much as I want to do these projects alone, I am going to need help from at least 5 people. The requirements to join the team are only having a creative mind. If you have 0 experience with programming, digital art, or any of the techincal positions we need, we will teach you your desired position. There will be no payment if you are an intern for your first product you help to make. After your first project with the company you will start getting paid but not full wages until you finish the education process.  If you have the technical experience, you will be getting paid but only after the publishing of the game and our workers will be paid royalties based on how much the game makes. This is because I am a communist and I want to show people that you can run a communist business in a capitalist society that runs on communist values and doesn't exploit their workers.

m2z365,Vedic Game - Based on the 4 Vedas,"This game would put everything said in the Vedic scriptures into a full fledged 3D interactive experience.\n\nFor those that do not know what the Vedas are scriptures based on Hinduism. Hindu religion has so many fantastic characters, with powers and abilities. These scriptures even have a huge epic story about creation. \n\nAs an example, in the Vedas it is stated that this earth is 4 billion miles wide in diameter. Imagine this in a game!!\n\nThere are so many multi-armed gods, demons, and many other types of creatures and beasts found in Vedic mythology. Multi-headed beings, spirits and entities. \n\nMy idea is to take everything word for word written in the Vedas and put it into an MMORPG experience. The blueprint is already written down in the Vedas, we just need to put it into a game. \n\nThere are some games that incorporate Gods, demons etc from Vedic lore. Like Smite, SilkRoad (back in the days). I'm talking a full game based off the 4 Vedas.\n\nI imagine this would be a huge situation for anyone to do."

m2lfj6,2d platformer where death isn’t the end,"So here’s the idea, you get 3 lives per checkpoint but those lives activate on the spot when you die, giving you 4 seconds of invincibility to get out of danger\n\n1. Living, nothing special, you go fast, have limited stamina for fighting and sprinting, can take a punch, can deal a punch, can dash past enemies, overall basic, you get slower and weaker as your health depletes(blunt attacks will simply remove health, but sharp attacks will cause bleeding which can stack)\n\n2. Zombie, you were killed by something basic(arrows, monster attack, fell too far, etc), you’re immune to poison, you’re slow but have unlimited stamina for sprinting(is as fast as running while alive) and fighting, you deal 3x damage with your hands, you also have an integrity bar that drains when you sprint, fight, fall, or get hit, letting it reach zero will make you die again and resurrect, note that fire and acid will deplete a full integrity bar to zero in just 3 seconds\n\n3. Skeleton, you either had your integrity bar reach zero or you died from fire or acid while alive, you’re immune to fire and poison, you run and sprint just as fast as when you were alive, you got unlimited stamina, but you can hardly deal a hit and die instantly when taking a hit, can dash past enemies, have a 20% chance to dodge melee attacks, 40% chance to dodge ranged attacks, have a bone density meter which drains when you come in contact with acid(acid depletes it fast, especially when you’re submerged and moving through it) which you can replenish by eating the bones of skeletons that litter the ground, as your density bar depletes, you become slower and the height it takes for you to receive fall damage(which will insta-kill you) becomes shorter to where you may have to restart the level"
m2k2pd,A music theme rouge lite where dungeon levels are procedurally generated from your MP3s,"A rouge lite game of some design that uses your own MP3 collection (if anyone still keeps a MP3 collection) to create the seed for each procedurally generated dudgeon level. \n\nThe game would analyze a MP3 for things such as track length, tempo and other things to create a level that is unique to that song. For example, longer songs create larger levels and faster songs create levels with hot theme. Any time that song is used it will generate the same level. You could play an endless mode on shuffle or try and beat your favorite album. \n\nThere could be other musical themed mechanics such as multipliers for striking on the beat and having to reach the next level before the end of the track."

m2fxxm,Your health bar is your sword,"Just a silly idea for a game where you battle with your actual health bars. I envision this as a top-down twin-stick battler where you swing your health bar around to damage enemies. When you are damaged, your health bar shortens, which reduces your reach.\n\nThis would be a pretty simple gimmicky idea, which could even work as a mechanic or specific weapon in a roguelite-type game."

m218hb,Mob boxer simulator,"You are a skilled boxer. Your fights are fixed by the mob.\n\nThere are two game modes, journeyman and champ. Journeyman mode features more fights where you *get beat up* and lose, and champ mode has more fights where you *beat up* your opponent and win*.*\n\nBefore a fight starts, you are told if you have to win or lose. \n\nIf you are the winner, you can be as aggressive as you want, but keep in mind your opponent is also working for the mob, so if you beat him up too much your boss will lose money. \n\nIf you are the loser, you will have to act like you are getting beaten up without getting hurt too much.\n\nWhen the fight is over, you will get a reward depending on three factors:\n\n\- How believable the fight was.\n\n\- How much money your boss made (drugs, alcohol, etc.)\n\n\- How much power your boss gained (political influence, new organization members, etc.)\n\nInspired by this post [https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/m1wxgt/racing\_game\_where\_you\_have\_to\_come\_in\_third\_place/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/m1wxgt/racing_game_where_you_have_to_come_in_third_place/)"

m1u5kz,AR Building Game,"A game like Pòkemon Go where the player walks around IRL to find various things. Around the world map you can find things material spots such as rocks or trees that you can harvest to earn materials. You can use the materials you've gotten to build tons of different structures like barracks, towers or houses. Player made buildings will appear to all players in the area and they can capture them or even destroy them. Most structures provide a boost like for example building a lumberjacks hut could produce wood every couple of minutes. Your goal is to have the most points by the end of a certain time like a week. Each structure is worth a certain amount of points so you have a better chance of winning by building more valuable structures. Players could even create a group and go through where they live to raid the structures of fellow players. That's just the core idea of the game."
m1t2kp,World of warships star wars,"How about a game that got the feel like in a wargaming game like world of warships in Star wars theme, like there are different tiers to start with and you get Bigger and better ships in the end. Map design with a lot of asteroids. What you think about this?"
m1qick,A FPS shooter utilizing chaos destruction in players,"I have no idea how you could manage pulling this off, but I just had the idea for an FPS game (probably a tactical shooter or VR shooter, as it would suit the style well) that uses some form of chaos destruction in the characters themselves. Imagine you shoot an enemy in the arm, and their arm is shattered off. This would lower their accuracy and raise their ADS speed drastically. I picture characters reminiscent of SUPER-HOT enemies, that shatter away like glass. Headshots would be insta kills, and leg shots may completely incapacitate players. Body shots ironically may be the least useful shots, as the wouldn’t compromise the structural integrity of the character. I think just this idea itself could easily be expanded on and would make for an extremely interesting, very strategic FPS that has really never been tried out to my knowledge. If I were a better programmer, I’d demo it myself, but I’m just starting off, so this is in another stratosphere from me."
m1pdn7,A VR game where you are the weapons operator on various military vehicles.,"This idea is inspired by video game levels like the AC-130 mission from Modern Warfare and the jet level from the BF3 campaign. \n\nIt would essentially be a series of different on rail shooting segments where you play as the gunner of various military vehicles. The weapon systems should operate realistically in respects their real world counter parts and each vehicle would give you a new system to learn. \n\nCurrent ideas for experiences\n\n* AC-130 Weapons operator\n* Apache Gunner\n* Blackhawk minigun door gunner\n* Venom M240 Door Gunner\n* Huey M60 Door Gunner\n* B-52 undermount ball gunner. \n* M1A1 Abrams Main Gunner\n* M1A1 Abrams Machine Gunner\n* Humvee M2 .50cal gunner\n\nThat said, there are plenty of military vehicles with dedicate gunner positions that would be fun to experience. \n\nThe developer could probably sell the different vehicles as separate DLCs kinda like how DCS does it. \n\nI think a hand full of crafted levels for each vehicle along with procedurally generated missions there could be a lot of replayability for an on rails shooter."
m1ol33,Adrenalin mechanic for shooters,Not sure if any game has done this but it seems like it could add depth to to the player mechanics of shooters.\n\nBeing shot at unexpectedly would spike your adrenalin and have a massive suppressing effect but being shot at while you are already engaged could sharpen your senses letting you use it to your advantage. \n\nIf your adrenalin levels stay too high for too long it would cause debuffs so stress would have to be managed.

Platform would be PC and Mobile Lite.\n\nI set up a website to better illustrate the concept.

m1kw3c,Zombie Tag,"Thought of this game last night. It's a left for dead style game where you are locked in a building with tasks in order to escape the building. There is no time limit, however, if a zombie kills you, the zombie takes your place and you become a zombie. Each round the humans survive, the non npc zombies evolve. For example, if you die three times, you evolve with the ability to be invisible until your first attack. If you die 5 times, you evolve with armor. ect. You could also have stats for the humans each round that they survive. Basically, imagine if left for dead and crawl had a baby."
m1kcaz,The darkness consumes,"A puzzle platformer where you play as an evil mage who has been cursed. Whenever they use a dark spell, a part of them gets consumed by darkness, they also made you forget all the advanced spells you once knew. You must get to the top of the tower of good to remove the curse, problem is that you are at the bottom of the tower.\n\nYou can push or hurt obstacles with a blast, and you can summon a platform almost anywhere you want. You can only get corrupted 13 times before you get completely consumed. Platforms corrupts you 2 times, while a blast only corrupts you 1 time. The more of you that is consumed, the more power full you become.  Blasts do more damage or have more knock back and platforms become bigger and last longer. But if you get consumed completely you lose. Use the purifying potions you find in some levels to become less corrupted(potions do not carry over multiple levels)."
m1gm2h,A Ego-Shooter Tower Defense Game,I played a lot of Bloons Tower Defense 6 lately and I got the Idea of a tower defense where you as the player have to control the towers. You have the ability to switch between tower through electronic. You can either control the tower or shoot out of the tower (on tanks or something else thats coming) Of course you can upgrade / build new towers and for the player it will be more and more difficult to switch between the right towers. This concept could also have a multiplayer.
m1g2pe,Aspect of Aligad: A Time-Loop RPG,"I'll preface by saying that I know next to nothing about the actual process of game design, only the elements that make games fun and how difficult it can be to make certain ideas work due to their complexity.\n\nI recently finished Atlus' *Persona 5* for the first time and immediately decided to restart the game in New Game+ mode, but as I did an idea began to form in my mind: what if, now that I've played the game all the way through and uncovered its central mystery, I could skip ahead and tell everyone that \[REDACTED\] is the true villain. How would that change the game?\n\nMy concept is for a turn-based RPG similar to something like Final Fantasy or Persona, but one in which you are caught in a time-loop (I know, a time-loop game. How original.). Over the course of the game, you will have a set amount of time to form bonds with various allies and learn more about the game's world in an attempt to uncover what (or who) is behind the end of the world. For example, say the time loop takes place across two months, at the end of which the world ends and everyone dies. You then have two months to form a party, learn about them, find clues that lead to unraveling the game's central mystery, and try and stop the apocalypse, *Majora's Mask* style. At the end of that loop, you reset, keeping nothing but the knowledge you gained in previous loops (and one other thing I'll get into momentarily). \n\nIn terms of story, the game takes place in a fictional fantasy world in which humans are able to commune with a group of Greek-style gods called the Pantheon, and some people are allowed to enroll in a school called the Elysian Academy in order to study magic. As students study here, they can form bonds with some of these gods, eventually sharing power with them as an Acolyte and potentially being chosen by a god to become their Avatar, wielding the full might of their power as their chosen champion.\n\nAt the start of the game, your character and their allies are all taken out by a massive, world-ending threat, but you are saved by one of the world's deities: the God of Time, Aligad. Aligad tells you that he can send you back a few months to try and figure out what causes the apocalypse, but it's up to solve the mystery as he cannot interact with you during the time loop for fear of causing a paradox. You start each loop on your first day as a prospective student at the Elysian Academy, and must form bonds with other students in order to gain allies, as well as form bonds with the gods in order to gain stronger powers. Acquiring certain knowledge may allow you to shorten the amount of time it takes to form bonds on subsequent loops; it may take an entire loop to make friends with the school bully on your first run, but when you're now armed with the knowledge that he secretly likes card games and has a crush on another classmate, you may be able to find a way to speed up the time it takes to make them your friend.\n\nThe one other thing that can come with you on time loops are ""Spirit Gifts"", which are essentially like the trinkets from *Hades* or the special objects received from maxed bonds at the end of *Persona 5*. When you max out a bond with a teammate or god, they will give you a gift that represents them and either grants greater power to yourself or your allies. However, on subsequent runs, the Spirit Gift can be given *back* to the person who gave it to you, restoring their memories of that run (and that run *only*), allowing you to skip the entire process of making them your ally. There are two rules to this, however: 1.) giving the Gift back to the original ally removes it from your inventory, and 2.) you cannot earn the Gift again during a run in which you've given it back, meaning you'll have to start all over with that ally on the next playthrough. You can also only have one of each Gift in your inventory at any given time.\n\nObviously, this game is influenced by several other titles. The RPG and social sim aspects are reminiscent of the *Persona* series; the time-loop mechanic to save the world has been done in *Majora's Mask* and *The Outer Wilds*; and the process of forming bonds with allies and gods to gain greater strength has a lot in common with *Hades*. But combined, it forms an interesting action-mystery story that rewards many playthroughs and branching narratives."
m1c1yb,We mobile users need a ragdoll game for android or ios.,I've always liked gta 4 and 5's ragdoll physics. I tried looking up a unity version but nothing is close. It would be great if you guys would maybe make a game for mobile with realistic ragdoll physics. Make it so that you can free play around an environment because all mobile games don't really let you freely play. Maybe it could blow up on the app store too because every ragdoll game on google play or App store is really bad. \n\nThank you
m19uqi,Ark's premise/story but it's medieval,"Currently I'm thinking about a game with the premise of Ark (open world, survival, crafting, building, role playing... basically Minecraft), and even though that game doesn't have an obvious plot as far as I know, I thought of Ark as being trapped on an island of dinosaurs by unknown entities (possibly aliens) forcing somebody or multiple people to survive on the island with nothing. It's not a simulation, it's real, and there's somewhat of a Jurassic Park theme going on. \n\nMy game idea is this: have this same story that I'm speculating about, and make it medieval with gathering skills. Maybe it's set in the near-future, and some sort of political entity forces one or more person(s) to survive in the middle ages with your memory intact, and you must uncover how you got there and how to get back.  Maybe something like Black Knight (2001) except with some knowledge of creating firearms you can be unstoppable with an army. \n\nSurvive and adapt, as you are getting familiar with the world you begin to live like you were born in that period. You create a kingdom and an army and fight other armies that try to conquer you. Mixing RuneScape's Ironman mode with Ark seems pretty good to me, anything like RS would be my dream game."
m163mj,[B~I] A fighting game where you control both characters,"I was watching Game Grumps play Brief Karate Foolish again and got a weird game idea...\n\nA fighter where you play both characters.\n\nIf you move, they move.  Trying to close distance on them means they are walking away and vice-versa.  Any attack would result in a draw as you punch/kick each other in exactly the same way\n\nSo, how do you make progress?\n\n\nIDK, it's just a throwaway.  Perhaps different characters have different moves, ranges and such so that each match is a sort of 'puzzle' where you have to figure out how to land a hit without getting hit in return... kinda like Divekick"
m1233x,A different kind of racing game,"Hey Guys!\n\nso I have had this idea for quite some time, I'll get right to it-\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nit's a racing game where the usage of nitrous is a must the game cant be played or won without the use of nitrous... buttttt there's a health bar too for your car and the twist is the more nitro you use your health also decreases in small numbers so you always have to keep a healthy balance between the health bar and nitro bar, and eventually if your health is too low the overall speed and performance of the vehicle will also be affected. So I know it's not the best ide out there... and I would love to hear the opinion and ideas about it from you guys, so if there is any query or a loophole or something feel free to comment, Thanks a lot :)  \n\nP.s - I don't if it this game will be good in 2d or 3d so therefore it isn't mentioned bu ti would love to hear about it from you guys about it being 2d or 3d"

I already have an idea in mind, something similar to the copy ability from Kirby, but I dont know how it would be executed. Example: in odyssey, the capture mechanic is the ""core"" mechanic, and cappy is the way it is executed. That is what I am requesting. A cool way to execute a mechanic.

m73bx5,I had a game idea a long time ago and I'm trying to make it better,"Hey there, I'm Peter and I had a game idea, a survival game which would have many things, mostly enemies, I made a list of enemies that I would add and its gigantic but I'm only gonna talk about the basics, so just like any survival game you need a character so I made Jeffery which is a simple creation, he has armlike tentacles, leglike tentacles, a small body with a X shaped belly button, a mouth on his head, two eyelike holes on his head above the mouth and finally hearing organs on top of his head, I had the idea of making you able to gain points and use them to upgrade yourself like gaining poison, climbing, running and other stuff, just like I said there are gonna be a crap ton of enemies like Long Legger, Wormer, Bat and Beezer but there are many more, there would also be friendship points which would allow you to befriend creatures, there would obviously be friendly fire because what is a survival game without creatures killing creatures? Magic leaves that give magic because why not? NPCs like Hunter, Little, Warrior, Failed Jeffery, Seller and others, a literal god called Unpawtune which would give items like Unpawtune's mark, Unpawtune's love and Unpaw's tune, creatures that use items for their advantage like thief, thief is a spider with two fangs that are used to grab items and throw them, this is one of my only ideas I took no inspiration for, creatures killing other creatures because I wanted to make something interesting so why not make creatures kill other creatures? And finally realistic physics because I wanted to add a slime like enemy, so I added the blob which is a slime like enemy that can be cut into pieces, it has something I call a host which is two halfs of a ball divided by a line which is nessessary to be broken to kill the blob, but I also wanted to make it a real blob by making it a soft body that when it hits the ground it spreads like water and then reforms\n\nThats it for my game idea, I have a big list of enemies but it literally has over a hundred lines so I'm just gonna keep it for myself for now"

m703fl,I am a game developer and going to make a game. I have a game idea. Tell me how is it please?," It is a 2d game. We are inside a PC world where we play as a program or  software (looks like a ninja  yellow color) there are enemies which are  viruses in the PC. we must reach a particular destination/escape from a  place. In every level there will be a computer which contain that  level's source code by reaching that computer and changing the code you can erase all the enemies in that level. And must not be seen by  enemies. enemies will be guarding the PC we must sneak through level  without seeing them. enemies will be following a path and they can't  look back. If they see you they'll come to catch you. There are puzzle in levels(means some things in the level may help you). You must use them  to change enemies attention). There is a multiplayer mode [also.In](https://also.In) multiplayer ,there will be two teams. with a slightly different gameplay/game goal/game story i hope u get it."

Many humans  ( Players) are curious about what appears to be a UFO landing in the ocean and in order to investigate some players decide to become virtual exploration scuba divers by Downloading our  free game app on Android GooglePlayStore or iOS for Free, players will create a profile, enjoy customizing and personalizing a character and then  join the game world in  an online community of other  curious scuba divers in search of the area in the Caribbean ocean where the mysterious UFO has crash landed....\n\nOver 5,000 Divers ( players) start diving the Caribbean ocean in hopes of finding riches and answers.  Once underwater divers can see that the UFO has unearthed what appears to be small coins of gold spread throughout the entire ocean floor in every direction as far as the eyes can see. Immediately, the group is split into two with 2,500 Divers focusing on becoming rich and famous by collecting the gold coins on ocean floor and the other 2,500  very curious Divers ( Players) stick together, swim towards the UFO  and seek to understand why,who,where from and basically just wish for answers pertaining to this mammoth craft that just crash landed into the Caribbean Ocean on Planet earth.\n\nUpon approaching the UFO the divers are semi blinded by a bright glowing light that appears to protect the ship and once close all 2,500 divers within the blink of an eye are all now aboard and inside the ship. Amazed,  Confused on how they went from swimming and wet to now inside and dry they quickly look around and can understand that the technology on board ship  is centuries away from what human are capable....\n\nAfter a few  minutes,  about 13 beings in appearance looking  not of this world approach the 2,500 divers at the massive hall on ship and present themselves as the Emissaries of their planet called LEIRA. As a  race they are called the A-GeeZ and come in peace with hopes of creating a trade alliance. \n\nThe A-GeeZ  explain that the Majestical  planet of  LEIRA is 10 times the size of earth on a Galaxy over 100 Billion light years away and it is a planet of love, happiness and freedom.  The terrain and weather is similar to the Caribbean Islands like on earth and the planet of Leira is perfect for human life to live to thrive . The food, fruits and vegetables grow at a rate 10 times on earth and thus hunger is not an option. Transportation and the entire planet is  automated using the advanced technology that only the A-Geez possess.  There is no currency, no politics and no suppression of any kind. The planet and its super advanced mechanical automation technology allows total freedom to create individual independence to any human that makes the planet of LEIRA their new home.\n\nThe A-GeeZ arrived aboard a 1 of 1 Colony Galactic  Hopper called the TRANZI with a Max capacity of 2,500 people. In the Caribbean ocean on Earth , it  is the last place in Galaxies anywhere where the exotically rare to find material or  ( 9.99 Virtual in game item ) called LIXIT can be harvested. LIXIT cannot travel in storage and Earth is at a distance where 1 full tank will allow the now Empty Tranzi will reach Leira and have exactly half tank of gas to return to earth. \n\nThe A-GeeZ now make an offer to these 2,500 divers (Initial day one players ) Safe passage and accommodation on the Planet of LEIRA.  \n\nOn the Planet of Leira....... wait....anyone want to hear more ?\n\n\nQuestions, comments, thoughts, name suggestions are welcomed thanks !"

m6vvql,I have a idea for a game. Tell me if it's a good idea or not?,"It's a space trader/smuggler game. You start off with just a crappy ship and buying a selling little products. Eventually getting better ships and getting bigger deals. Going to new systems and such.  You can start getting other workers and building automated trade routes. Though the real fun would begin when the products your buying and selling could potentially lead to economic issues on planets, you could fund wars and aid certain groups. What do you guys think? It would be in a first person point of view and you'd have to do emergency repairs to your ship if something happened."
m6uyb0,"idea for a game ""Ramjet Raccoon""","now I'm not really set on the gameplay genre though it would probably be a flying game similar to star fox but the idea would be that the game has an aesthetic and humor similar to cartoons from the 1960s like ""rocky and bullwinkle"" or ""yogi bear"""
m6uoeh,Chexser,"Chexser is a 3D abstract strategy board game a lot like chess, but has no indicia, is played with 9 pieces on an uncheckered grid, and uses rules based on physics. Geometric surface, inertia, resistance, momentum, shadow, tangency. The goal is to occupy two cubes in the plane of your opponent's home row by advancing your strategy while simultaneously capturing and avoiding capture and defending your own home row. \n\nI want to create a 3D mobile board game experience from the prototype I invented, much like Words With Friends. I would be interested to learn from this community what the best options are to license a game to developers.\n\nThe target audience is anyone with that special ability to visualize future moves and outcomes in 3D in their minds, much like any chess grandmaster. But Chexser is far more challenging than chess. \n\nThe mobile version will need the ability for the user to change the omega angle of the camera's frustum to effectively view the 3D relationship of the pieces and assess their next move options.\n\nI expect there will be questions. The best way to appreciate the joy of Chexser is to play test a few rounds. First post ever here. Maybe someone has some ideas."

m6rgi4,Fantasy action RPG centered around music as the source of magic,"I love the whole idea and concept of Brutal Legend but my biggest grudge with the game is how the AXE is the main weapon.  In a world where music is power i want the instrument to be the main weapon. \n\nMaybe you can choose between different instruments and then a style and this would could be how you create a class. You could choose a violin and classical music for a straight healer, or maybe violin and metal for a different sort of support/utility class.\n\nFor actual gameplay, itd be like leveling up different types of magic users and the endgame would feel like  controlling Demyx from KH.\n\nThen of course you could work with other characters/players to make more complex pieces of music that is more potent.  \n\nThe most difficult part of this concept would be making just a vast quantity and variety of music that would fit all the different classes"

m6nx19,"GTA-like open world game, but the city is procedurally generated and the AI is bleeding edge","If there's anything that makes the GTA series of games very fun, it is the open world and sandbox-like experience. Of course, being that the city is limited, it will eventually get boring (or at the very least, relative to something like Minecraft).\n\nHow can we fix this? My big brain tells me that procedural generation and an improvement in both NPC and non-NPC AI would do the trick. And it's certainly doable (with enough time and patience of course). Implementing the procedural generation wouldn't be that hard; there is even a web app that generates city maps from random noise. On the other hand, the NPC could have better interactivity (perhaps using GPT3 or some other deep learning / generative tech).\n\nHere's an idea, I guess."

m6ihyj,Slit-Throat Circus ( Game Idea + Survey ) ( potentially upsetting themes )," Hey, I'm Will, a student of a collage currently in his second year Final Major Project. For my project I need to do a couple essays for research into my project, because of this I was hoping to gain some primary research as well as gain some clarity for the kind people of reddit.\n\nMy project is called ""Slit-Throat Circus"", the game follows Eva, a girl made of pure light that wears porcelain clothing and armour that keeps her together, she is a trapeze artist and therefore has to rely a helleva lot on her family in the circus to make sure everything is perfect and nothing breaks, and rely even more on her partner in her act to catch her when she jumps, as this could easily end with her shattering, if they weren't there. Because of this Eva has developed a dependency issue to her dysfunctional family within the circus and is devastated to hear the circus is splitting up after a rumour of a horrible accident ends up getting the circus closed down.\n\nThe game takes place as you (Eva) fruitlessly try to pull your dysfunctional family back together whilst the mental issues they face end up throwing you even further away from you in the end. The message of the game is that of sometimes needing to let go, and give people space, which gives you two endings, if you don't learn to let go. The rift between you and them falls apart in an awful case of abuse. If you do heed the message of the game, you take solice in a short meeting with your act partner, and face hope that things could get better in the future, and you begin to work on letting yourself be happy without needing any others.\n\nPhew that was a lot, now that you know that, I would love for you to please take my survey so I can record the answers, also there is a final question for any extra thoughts you have, but the comments of this post works well for that too.\n\n[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdxXlu1TlU29IDzdYkjdUhSAIUYD1F9h--vwrO5bjo0P9zKiQ/viewform?usp=sf\_link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdxXlu1TlU29IDzdYkjdUhSAIUYD1F9h--vwrO5bjo0P9zKiQ/viewform?usp=sf_link)\n\nHave an amazing day :)"
m6hrl1,How do you think a MOBA would work in VR?,"I know that MOBA's in general seem to be slowing down, but I'm curious what you all think would make for an interesting twist on the MOBA genre if it were in VR. (For those who don't know, a Multiplayer Online Battle Arena is typically a game like League of Legends, DoTA2, etc.)\n\nHow would combat function? Targeting and using abilities? Would the normal 3-lane structure still work, or is there a better way? Would it work better in first person or not? \n\nI think this could be a neat idea if implemented creatively. Thoughts?"
m6h5e3,Men Of War or Company of Heroes style historical RTS/RTT with campaigns based on various wars between rival communist nations during the cold war,"I've always been disappointed in the lack of media about events such as the Sino-Soviet split and the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia, especially considering people are running dry on historical ideas to base games off of because almost everything else has been done already (WW2, Vietnam, Desert Storm/Modern Warfare etc) and a Korean War strategy game would essentially just be a WW2 strategy game but depressing. Not too many people are aware of the fact that the cold war was not simply ""East vs West"" and ""Communists vs Capitalists"" but a lot of the more intense shooting wars tended to happen between communist nations that western nations just kind of watched and pointed at from a distance.  \n\n\nThe campaigns can be played in order of ""severity"" IE the tutorial mission will involve the border clashes between the Soviet Union and China that thankfully didn't go beyond scattered firefights, and the final campaigns will involve something like China's invasion of Vietnam. All of these will come with a short historical video listing the reasons why the conflict took place and the various reactions of the international community to them.  \n\n\nThere could also be various alternate history scenarios, such as a war between various Warsaw Pact nations and Yugoslavia, a Vietnamese counterattack against China (maybe with the assistance of ROC forces from Taiwan and Soviet equipment?) or even a ""worst case scenario"" where the Sino-Soviet split *does* escalate into a full blown war where each side tries to woo the United States into assisting them  and there's a very real threat of it escalating into a nuclear conflict.  \n\n\nCall it something like The Broken Monolith due to the Sino-Soviet split sometimes being referred to as ""the shattering of monolithic communism""."

m6ck1m,What do all of the flairs mean? An explanation,"I feel like I don't see enough explanation for the flairs (Oftentimes, beginner is misused), so here is a quick run down.\n\n**Beginner** \- The game idea itself could be created by a single beginner in a couple of days. (Not that you are a beginner). **Example**: Pong / Tetris\n\n**Intermediate** \- A game idea that could be created by an individual/small team, probably in a couple of weeks to months. **Example:** Super Mario Bros, Don't escape 3\n\n**Experienced -** A game idea that could be created by an individual/small team, probably in a couple of years. **Example:** Spelunky, Iconoclasts.\n\n**AAA -** A game with a massive scope. Would need millions of dollars to make, and would require a large team \~200 people. (WARNING: If your game idea is AAA, it will most likely not be made. I'm not saying change the flair to experienced, I'm saying reduce the scope.) **Example:** Grand Theft Auto V, FIFA 21\n\n**Dream -** You had this game idea in a dream.\n\n**Abstract -** The game idea does not fit well into a pre-defined category, and is kind of a genre of its own. \n\n**Meta -** What this post is. Discussing things to do with the sub.\n\n**Request -** You are looking for game ideas about a specific topic, not asking someone to make a game. (Make sure your request is about a specific idea. Don't make a request saying you need a game idea - just browse the sub.) **Example:** Request for horror game mechanics involving Lucifer.\n\n**Mobile -** A game idea that would be exclusively made, or mainly for, mobile. **Example**: Angry Birds\n\n**Mechanic** \- Something that is not a game idea itself, but rather a feature that could be used. **Example**: Undertale's act/spare option, Brave's rewinding time feature.\n\n**VR -** A game idea that would be exclusively made, or mainly for, VR. **Example**: Superhot\n\n**Other-** Doesn't fit into one of these categories."
m6bknu,Teleport dash," basic idea of the video game is following, you shoot projectiles/orbs and when you press certain input you teleport to them and gain them back agian. Now the orbs can have different types. For example some may telport you staticaly and some may give you momentum, some may reflect form objects some may destroy upon collision and some may be used maybe as an camera for discovering places where you would not be able to get otherwise.

m6ahgc,A battle royale game loosely based on the rules in the Jet Li movie The One (or Highlander if you want),"So 100 (or however many) players drop on the map, we all know how it starts, FPS in the beginning collect better and better weapons and kill anyone who comes across your path.  As players get killed the other players become more and more powerful physically, doing more damage with their fists/rifle butt, increased running speed, an increase in health, and jumping higher.  At first this just increases the verticality of combat and the kill time as more and more powerful guns are required to kill efficiently.  Once a number (maybe half) has been reached then supernatural powers begin to be unlocked, maybe in the form of Dragon Ball style energy blasts, speed boosts, flight, energy blades, lightning from hands, energy shields.  As players become more powerful the game evolves (devolves?) into a 3d fighting game with the last of the players powerful enough to tear apart the map itself as they battle."
m69o9f,Local Multiplayer Rhythm Game | College Project,"To keep things nice and short as not to waste any of your time, the game idea I came up with for my College Project is to make a Local Multiplayer Rhythm Game.\n\nThe idea is that you will be able to collect better and better items the higher a combo you build, and if you lose your combo you will also lose your item (Risk / Reward).\n\nThese items will be used to influence the other players, from visual trickery to gameplay mix-ups.\n\nAnyway, I have a super short questionnaire and it would help a lot to get some responses on it: [https://forms.gle/TVNfgeQsEAkdYdjv7](https://forms.gle/TVNfgeQsEAkdYdjv7)"
m68pef,Interdimensional prison break,"An action adventure game (Diablo like) with rogue like and souls like elements. The characters will have different weapons available to them, and different skills based on the class the player chooses.\n\nThe game world will consist of a series of different procedurally generated maps ranging from industrial space prisons, to jungles, to caves, ect. The player will be set down in a random map, and have to traverse the interdimensional prison portal systems in order to escape. Unlike a traditional roguelike the game doesn't end when the player dies but they are instead sent back to the nearest checkpoint. The checkpoints double as a shop and similar to Shovel Knight the player is also able to destroy these checkpoints to gain a bonus, at the expense of losing that saved progress. Like a souls game, enemies respawn on dieing or on using a checkpoints shop.\n\nThe ultimate goal of the game is to reach an escape point, but the player(s) may have to traverse many maps in order to find one, so the only way to truly lose the game is to give up. Additionally, there are no character levels, different equipment and improvements can be made, but the player character will not get better unless they progress in the game world."

And must not be seen by enemies. enemies will be guarding the pc we must sneak through level without seeing them. enemies will be following a path and they can't look back.

So you play as a man who basically governs the town you settle in and build house, churches, taverns basically all the stuff that comes out in a city building game.

The player carrying the eternal shard in its inventory wins the game for the amount of time holding it. You can read the best list in the details of the item. In the story the eternal shard is carrying the game world and a secret. The eternal shard is always to find for everybody on the map. Furthermore the eternal shard spends ""unlimited"" life time because in the game exist an kind of ""aging"" mechanic. The heartbeat.\n\nThe game generates heartbeat for the player in intervals. In the birth stage very fast. Later the intervals getting bigger and bigger. The player can use heartbeat to do actions in the game. Some actions (powerful spells) need more percentage of your heartbeat than other. When the intervals getting bigger after time your actions, depending of what actions you are doing in age, can consume you. Your collected heartbeat represents your healthbar/manabar/staminabar. Own actions and actions of other players will affect your collected heartbeat in %. Drops your collected heartbeat zero (% damage of 1) you will loose your items (look, skills) and the materials you crafted them from will respawn in the game world.\n\nThe game world consits of small and huge shards player can travel, farm and use. The eternal shard is carrying the empty game world called the space shard. Space carries shards of earth. Shards of earth can carry shards of water, sand, rocks on it. A shard of rock can carry metal on it... up to the most rare material you can craft into powerful items that gives your character abilities, look and gameplay to protect or damage heartbeat. Some special (rare, legend) shards/materials that only extists in low numbers creates their own shards with strong npc on it to protect the material after it respawns.\n\nAfter a character drops zero his items will be destroyed and the material will respawn in the gameworld. Some on known locations, some random, some with a timer or shrinking circle on the map, some hidden.\n\nThe items are like upgrades for the player. The items also allow to protect heartbeat by providing basic skills with zero heartbeat consumtion or providing heartbeat shield.\n\nThe eternal shard will provide you with frequent heartbeat, so the intervals don't get bigger. The intervals for the eternal heartbeat are based on the intervals when the player got the shard. In the ""young age"" of the player when the heartbeat interval is high the player will not be able to receive the shard doe to its lack of skills. With the first HB you need to collect materials, craft some items to gain further skills, by the time the player reaches the capability to carry the shard his heartbeat is on a well balanced level so even ""young"" eternals can be beaten by other player. If they dont rule most of the gameworld like an eternal king. ^\n\nBut the player can don't mind the eternal war, or fight or however they call the neverending run for glory arround the eternal shard. It can also live a peaceful life, travel the shards and find out what all this is about."

m60fvz,Flying,"Flying has been humanity's dream since the dawn of time, but there are hardly any comforting games about it aside from the handful of flight-combat sims. Adventure games such as Zelda:BotW and Genshin-Impact only offer a stiff gliding mechanic, but I understand why they do so as it would overpower their challenges. Any bird-sims I've searched for have been extremely aimless and boring, basically fly A-to-B in a straight line. I've been wondering what adventure/tasks would be appropriate with flying without being a broken mechanic. Maybe a game like Pokemon Snap where you fly around an island taking pictures? Preferably something open but with tasks involved. What are your suggestions?"

m5yizu,A game that plays like Half Life but it takes place during the 2011 Earthquake and Tsunami in Japan.,"It would be an FPS that plays kind of like Half life, especially the aspect of maneuvering your way through damaged areas using ingenuity and problem solving. The environment would be extremely dynamic allowing for gameplay that revisits areas multiple times in different states of destruction.\n\nI think instead of the heavy focus on combat as in Half life, this game could be more search and rescue based with some sort of reward for rescuing people as you progress from area to area. There should still be a greater story arc so it's not just a grind of racking up rescues. I think there needs to be a grand mission to keep you motivated throughout.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne possible story I just came up with now could go something like this:\n\nYou are a junior researcher working for a small company in Japan and are currently going over paperwork and blueprints for a safety review of the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear plant and are a really keen young student so you know the place inside and out on paper but have yet to make a field visit to the actual site. \n\nThen the events we all know happen and you experience building collapse, flooding, fires, and pretty much every other disaster realistically plausible as you try to make your way to the Fukushima Prefecture and eventually inside the plant to take advantage of some critical detail you know can stop the meltdown before it gets any worse.\n\nTo give an idea of the atmosphere I would want to go for here is the video I saw that inspired this idea (Imagine the building they are filming from is the research office building you start out in at the beginning of the game.) [https://youtu.be/smUkaSJZ7EE](https://youtu.be/smUkaSJZ7EE)  \n\n\nAdditional note: I think the most difficult part would be due to the fact that this is based on real events in a real place so you would either have to go full hardcore authentic with a ton of research so as to be respectful of the very real disaster that happened there. OR make it based in a fictional island nation while keeping the main points of; major earthquake, tsunami, nuclear disaster. Although I think keeping the Japanese setting and culture would add a lot to the games atmosphere."
m5y94w,A little upgrade(?) to elo system,"Normal elo system generate a lot of rage. While rage might not be a bad thing in a single-player game created specifically to frustrate the player, it probably wont do any good in a multiplayer environment.\n\nSo, how about buttons like ""I want to dominate!"" and ""I want a challenge!""? They will send the player to a less/more rated opponent respectively, and this game wont do any bad to weaker player's elo. Maybe make it so it's only usable each 10 games or something.\n\nI didnt do any math or anything on that, it just sounds like fun. Please tell if anything can fail with that and, maybe, tell how to upgrade this."

m5o6si,Point and click adventure set in various bodies of fiction.,"# Story\n\nHumanity is constantly under threat from cosmic beings that think they know what's best for it despite not understanding them at all. This time, a threat is attempting to stunt humanity's imagination by invading worlds created by iconic stories and changing the endings for the worse. Luckily, you can enter these worlds yourself and use the abilities granted by their status to ensure the proper endings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Basic Mechanics\n\nEach world's events progress in real time parallel to the protagonist's narrative, but for whatever reasons, something shows up that either hinders them completely or forces them to progress another way. You have to help them get past it. Some obstructions do only minimal damage and you can get them down a proper path afterward, but too many obstructions at one time may lead to a critical event which completely derails the story resulting in a game over.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Gameplay\n\nIf you search the game world beyond the protagonist, you can uncover collectable objects called word souls. By using word souls in the right places, you can trigger events that can allow the protagonist to progress. Individual word souls only exert their influence over a single point, character, or object, but if you sting them together to make a statement, you can cause an event that affects the area as a whole and can draw things in from external areas. However, using a statement removes the last word soul used in the statement from the player's inventory. It doesn't matter how you do it or how much it seemingly changes the story, as long as the protagonist reaches the proper ending, you can leave and it will be as if you were never there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Difficulty\n\nDifferent worlds are more difficult than others depending on how the stories are structured. The easiest are often stories that follow one protagonist exclusively, but having multiple narratives surrounding multiple parties of characters requires you to juggle your attention between them. Sometimes, the worlds will be changed in a way that benefits the antagonist, thus requiring you to use word souls to hinder them while at the same time ensuring that they meet the protagonist for the story's climax."

m5hlqs,A Alien Vs Marine Battle Royale,"A battle royale game where 75 Marine players land on lv426 which is controlled by 75 Alien players that will sit in wait and construct traps for the marines. Every marine the Aliens kill becomes an Alien for thier team. The aliens are weak in small numbers so the Alien team will need to team up in order to kill as many marines as possible. The marines also need to team up if they are going to destroy the alien nests as well as the hordes of aliens they will face. A bit like Starship Troopers I guess. Juggernauts for the alien side can be the queen alien, and for the marines the power loader. Sorry if this has been said before."
m5hhn3,An open-world Toy box simulator,"A Toy box Simulator for Role-playing\n\nI don't know if anyone had the same thought when they were a child, but I kinda wish there was a sandbox game that feels like playing with toys. Let me explain my thought process. So I saw this mobile game called Sakura school simulator, it is a game where you play as a teenager in high school, similar to yandere school simulator but upon further watching videos on YouTube there are people who use it as some kind of role-playing game.\n\nThey customize their character to their liking, they have houses and also family which my guess is also created by the player. And afterwards, they will narrate what is happening, or make the characters talk with dialogues. I watched a video where this family is expecting their new member in the hospital, which had nothing to do with the internal game story.\n\nThe character is controlled using a joystick, and you can have the NPC that you created follow you. You can also drive cars around the town. So not really what I thought when seeing the title of the game, which is a school simulator.\n\nI was wondering if any game have a similar feeling to this, where you can create your own character, NPC's, house and even town. Of course people are going to suggest the sims, It's the closest thing that resembles what I was describing. However, I had different feelings when I played it. It's a fantastic game, and the creation tools are far the finest in my opinion for a simulator game, for now anyways. And it has a really pleasing aesthetic and art style. But it is what it is, a simulator, and it's wonderful, just not really a toy box for you to play.\n\nA toy box or a sandbox is really about creating and building rather than simulation or survival. We have great games in both simulation and survival genre, but not sandbox in my opinion. The freedom or intuitiveness of making the representation of what we want are very limited. Here is a game that I wish to exist, with the following tools. Bear with me, I'm borrowing a lot from other games, they're proven to be excellent, I'm just hoping for the ultimate thing.\n\n**Open World Map Tool**\n\nThe ultimate thing for me is probably a game, or a platform where you can create and customize an area, as big as a well sized open world map. Has this been done before? Yes actually, Cities: Skylines does this perfectly. Imagine making an open world map is this intuitive, for non-game developers. We get to create our own maps the way we like it. Although one may think that populating a city is a heavy task, but for me, it isn't about the simulation, it's a Lego set. Beside Cities skylines also simulate the citizens, and it feels alive enough, they even simulate traffic.\n\n**Buildings and Houses**\n\nCities Skylines sounds incredible right? But you can't really customize a building freely. Yes it comes with great presets, and the mods are really amazing. But if you want to make a specific building in mind, you have to rely on those mods and presets, or you can make it yourself in 3d modeling programs such as blender or sketch up and import it yourself, which requires another step. If we can customize a building with the freedom like the one we have in the sims 4, we will never run out of buildings to use, because we can change the size, heights, colors and materials, to also fit it with the aesthetics you desire. Of course a house also need interiors, it's half the fun of making a house and a critical part of role-playing too. Of course making interiors for every single building is unrealistic. But creating one for your play session is actually, really fun. I remember being a kid and making all sort of imaginary places using things I found in my toy box for my figures to interact.\n\n**Characters and NPCs**\n\nYou create the characters, or just use the presets available. Having a great character creator is really great way to express yourself and also to have fun with designs that you can come up yourself. And then you can place the other characters anywhere you want with a specific animation or task. Maybe even dialogs.\n\n**Gameplay and Multiplayer**\n\nAnd last, the gameplay. So what is it? How do one play it…\n\nIt's up to you really, It's a sandbox without a story, you create one you own with the settings and characters that you created. For some people it may sound stupid, but for I think a small group of people, or someone like me, this is all I ever need. And the idea of a multiplayer is also quite interesting, you can invite friends to play in your world, just like playing toys in real life.\n\nNow is this too much to ask, yes. But I can't help but to express it, maybe there is actually a game that plays like this that I don't know about. There are games that actually really come close with the idea, here's what I came across.\n\n1. Minecraft\n2. Roblox\n3. Fortnite: Creative Mode\n4. Disney Infinity\n5. The Sims Series\n6. PS4/5 Dreams\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese tools and ideas are also mentioned a lot in the term Meta verse, which is slowly becoming a reality. I am so hoping that it includes these kinds of features and freedom to really create your universe. If you have ideas to add or would like to share please do!"
m5h23h,FPS but with a Martial Art combat mixed in it,"It's a random game idea while considering R6 as the base concept (because of their sick cinematics).\n\nThe idea is you could run up to them(enemy) and initiate a close range combat rally performed with the melee hotkey and there would be keys popping up in the screen that would prompt your character to throw in the next punch/counter. Basically, it's going to be a battle of reflex, but hopefully not going to be abused. When initiating the combat state, there would be keys popping up and would gradually start getting faster and the players likewise have to react faster. It could last until the other person will be in a knocked down state after losing hp. If the combat mode stops because either of the player missed their respective key, the person who won the combat rally will be given a subtle knockback but will be able to counter with a quick hipfire but with inaccuracy and unable to ads, while the other who lost will be knocked back but not down. During the close range rally, I'm not sure if your teammate should be able to assist you, ASSUMING he won't accidentally friendly fire you. This could prevent them to carelessly shoot and HS. But once you're down, your teammate can get that chance to help you. But then if your teammate shoots, the other side would be aware of your position as well. Thus it's a double edge blade. It's also a nice thing to end match points during a 1v1 situation.\n\nI really don't know. In my head, it would look really cool just watching your teammate charging in as a decoy, and you running ahead to get the defuser planted, and behind you are 2 people trying to kill each other with good animation slapping it. And in some scenarios, the enemy got your teammate in a downed state, then just after you looked there to save him, Cav is there already pointing the pistol's muzzle at your face. ""Spill out the beans."" VERY CINEMATIC !! Well that's just what I think."
m5f4zc,Fallout but ice age,"I didn't know how to say it with a few words, but, the world has gone through another ice age, humanity was barely able to survive it and now people live in domes with heating and only leave when they search for resources.\n\nThe gameplay is the same as the first two fallout games but with the addition of temperature management."
m5erni,Post-apoc/mad-max themed ultra-light/light aircraft combat game.,"I'm thinking paragliders with mounted miniguns vs gyrocopters that fling acid-bombs or molotov-style bombs vs swift silent stealthy gliders packing .50 cal sniper rifles vs small cessnas with dudes literally strapped onto the wings packing repeater rifles and crude home-made blunderbuss guns. \n\nAdd in random dust storms that obscure vision temporarily and maybe some electrical storms that can temporarily stun planes and pilots if they get zapped. For some really randomized gameplay add in randomly appearing anomaly type stuff that acts as a black-hole/tractor beam and sucks nearby players towards it. \n\nAdd in the house from up floating by plus some missions where you destroy ground targets like grain silos, enemy bases, watertrucks fleeing with the women-folk etc and it could be a title people wanna buy..."
m5cl3q,Want to make a game but have no way to do so,"Hi! I’ve been wanting to make a game for almost 2 years now, but I have no experience with coding, and every time I’ve tried to learn a coding language I’ve failed horribly, I have no art experience, and I have no money to hire someone to make it. My idea is for a 2d puzzle platformer with an art style similar to cave paintings, and have the character move across the texture, and the player has to use multiple abilities to progress further into the game and unravel a secret lurking in the depths of the cave. My question is should I give up on this? I have a large chunk of the game planned out and have been wanting to make it for over 2 years, but I have no way of possibly making it. Might delete this soon"
m5bmb7,An IOS game Similar to Warcraft (not World of Warcraft),"Just a simple RTS similar to the 1996 computer game warcraft 2. Doesn't need to be exactly the same, just have two races; have the collection of lumber, gold, and oil; have some land, air, and sea troops. Sorry this isn't very detailed but it would be cool to see an app with the same sort of style as warcraft 2."
m59fnn,The Internet in a Game,"TL;DR at bottom\n\nMy idea is for a web browser that instead of typing in your designated url and clicking buttons to surf the web, you can actually traverse a physical Internet.  A place where you can walk up to an icon(?) on a virtual map that would transport you to the website of your choice.\n\nI had someone make a little demo.  Not sure if this is going to work but here's the link:\n\nhttps://playcanv.as/p/Cysa2nk4/\n\nIt would work like this except instead of going back to the start you would leap to a new website with whatever square you walk to.\n\nI figure instead of starting on an entirely new browser you should first make a website.  Gain traction.  Add new rooms, twists and turns that are exciting and urge users to keep trekking to the bowels of the internet.  Urge users to make this their homepage and allow for some customizability.\n\nInstead of a gray screen at first, make a translucent grey screen so people can see your world through a haze.  Have a few circles with pictures of their favourite urls arranged in a circle like the GTA radio stations/gun menu.  One of the icons should be the settings.  then if they click the middle or anywhere that isn't a circle url the haze fades away and they can walk around exploring the internet.\n\nIf this works the next step is to sell spots of land in your world for sites to purchase and have a prime spot in the landscape of the internet. Or allow them to buy banner adds on the walls of your maze advertising themselves to everyone who walks by.  Animate the ads and make them pop.\n\n(Optional) add joke posters and videos on the walls at first then slowly replace them with more paid advertisements to encourage users to look at the ads.\n\nOnce this works then start thinking about an entire web browser for this, of course with the option of typing in a url the old fashion way.\n\nNext you can make the ultimate play.  Create a OS like Apple that is entirely game based.  Make a filing cabinet people can search through to find their files.  Make a display people can show see their favourite photos on without searching through their computer for them.  Incorporate hardware, OS an web browsing all into one fun game.\n\nBonus points: add VR functionality, this OS is made for that\nBonus points: add branded storylines with the heroes and villains being paying advertisers\nBonus points: for awesome graphic and unique mechanics you could not do walking in real life but are made for the virtual world\n\nI spent a lot of time thinking about this and I really think it could be the next billion dollar company(?) if it had the right team working on it.  And the more I think about it the more I know it is not me.\n\nBut if you need a CFO that understands the idea and the industry I am your man.\n\nTL;DR Make the internet into a map that you can walk in to make it to your website of choice"

mi4qtt,Idea for an educational gardening game based around genetic inheritance,"It would be based on Gregor Mendel's research, and you would be able to grow multiple types of plants and actually have to take care of them and see them grow in order to evaluate the results of plant breeding. You start with a Pisum Sativum plant maybe and there are a lot to collect but the main point is to find the main well-known ratios like 3:1 and 9:3:3:1. My idea is that this could be a calming and atmospheric game that takes about 1 real week to finish and is intended to be used in middle school or early high school classes. A game that is kind of similar is that streetpass gardening game for the 3DS where you grow flowers and upgrade your garden and buy better plants. The visuals would be realistic but simple, I would want the aesthetic of the butterfly section in the animal crossing new horizons museum though."
mi2puw,Action RPG,"Hi guys,\n\n So I have had this idea of a game called ""Circulum"" for quite a few years now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe game is in action RPG that is inspired by the JRPG genre  (Neir, Genshin)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe protagonist (and others in the world) wield rings that spawn a sword (your weapon). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou play as the protagonist (i have always named him Seven), who is going to school to be apart of the Vanguard(This worlds version of Police) . There are no guns in this world, Just swords that spawn from your ring(there would be some basic ones but also unique ones with perks).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe 1st game takes place in high school, 9th grade to be exact. Unlike normal education system, in this world you would do the general education until 9th grade then if you want to join the Vanguard, you enroll in special courses from grade 9-12, if not you take the regular courses. 20% of the first game you are going through the academy to become a deputy in the Vanguard. Once Seven graduates, he is approved for tier 5 missions (Civilian quest, traffic duty). He does this until he stumbles upon something way out of his approval. Circulum smugglers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow in this world, these ""rings"" are only given to certain people, so there are groups that try to steal, sell, smuggle Circulum. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile doing investigation work he shouldn't be doing on this matter (This is probably a tier 2 case) , he learns that there is a group of people called ""The Sonar"" that have learned of 5 Circulum that have godly powers. Each ring is its own unique sword, but put 5 rings on at the same time (something that cant be done with your average Circulum) and you have an unstoppable force.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow at the end of the game ""Sonar"" has only manage to find 1 of the Mystical Circulum, Seven defeats  one of the henchmen that was sent to get that Circulum and takes it.\n\nThe game would have alot of snarky comedic aspects (Think deadpool but more PG-13)\n\nNow im obviously holding back ALOT of the details. I wanted to make this game but i cant because i just dont know how to lol. I wanted to write a Visual novel about it but i cant draw lol. I have this whole universe in my head for this idea and thats probably where it'll stay.\n\nIf you made it this far, thanks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow i have to go back to work lol."
mi0vr4,Puzzle game - unfinished idea,"Hey guys, I have an idea of the puzzle game I would like to make, based on levels. The basic idea is simple. Imagine human-sized cube, you can walk around it, and only a part of the ""reality"" is visible from each side. What I mean is: from one side, u can see something like obstacles that are in your way, from other side, you can see finish line and so on. But I am not sure, how it really should look like, if it has to be something like puzzles in The witness, or something like maze, or something where you just get a sphere on some track and you have to take that spehere to the finish line, while you are trying to avoid the obstacles. Basically, puzzle game that is based on that you can see different things in cube from different perspective and you have to ""merge"" these views into one in your head and find the right way. So do you guys have some fresh ideas, what should be really in the cube? And how would player ""control"" that, whats inside. Like, if there was a sphere, how would player move it?"

mhlnj1,Possible good idea for a horror game,"Posted this idea in either r/stonerphilosphy or r/highdeas awhile back and now it's here:\n\nIt starts out as an Innocent lighthearted interior decorating/home renovation simulator where Taika Watiti voice acts the player character's Uncle Jimmy. The beginning portion of the game has a non threatening art style\n\nMaybe the player collects some cute stickers or something?\n\nOver the course of the game, as the player and uncle Jimmy  progress thru the renovation of many different houses they will see the occasional ghostly figure or blood stain and hear unnatural noises in-game and unlock pieces of ghost hunting equipment. It is slowly, subtly revealed that this in fact a horror game disguised a light hearted home renovation simulator.\n\n\nThe funny part is Taika Watiti's Character reacts to the ghosts as nonchalantly as possible, saying things like ""Huh, that was mildly unsettling"" or ""never seen that before"".\n\nOnly problems are that i have no game development experience and i sure as hell can't afford Taika Watiti"

mhgn7l,Do you think this idea could work? A battle royale meets dungeon crawler,"I’ve thought if an idea which to me works well, but I don’t know if it’d only work on paper. I’m thinking of actually making this so I’m hoping others think it could actually work. \n\nSo I’m thinking up to 10-12 people start in a typical dungeon, with dark souls movement, with realistic graphics, third person, and the ability to block and so on. \n\nEach player starts at a different location, and have to go down paths fighting creatures and enemies to get better gear.

Checkmates are an automatic win (obviously), but if the game extends beyond the length of the song used, then the win is determined by a score system that’s a combination of move evaluation (ex. Good moves award the most points, blunders subtract points, etc.) and the score of your rhythm to the music.\n\nThis idea’s simply a rough draft, a spontaneous concept my brain randomly made up in a few minutes. However, I would like to see what everyone else thinks of it."
mhaxif,Simulated Party RPG?,"So I was wondering if this would be enjoyable to some people, kind of as a gimmick thing.\n\nYou know in most games of this nature, you create a team of characters with different skills and etc., then usually in turn-based fashion, you make decisions for them.\n\nBut what if you just assembled the team, level them up and etc., but then when the actual gameplay comes in, you just give them a goal to achieve and the AI will try to accomplish it on their own. Different characters would have different personalities and do things in unique ways, things like that.\n\nMaybe even decide their own equipment each mission, perhaps even end up fighting each other if their decisions clash or similar scenarios. \n\nIMO this would be fun, but wouldn't be much of a ""game"". It would be more like a simulation that you just watch. It would still be enjoyable?"

mh94c9,Clicker/FPS/Tower-Defense Mashup?,"You start with a simple revolver and collect resources that drop from fallen enemies attacking your location. Resources can be spent to upgrade equipment, buy new equipment or place structures and allow building a base.\n\nBase building would include ""lures"" which increase the number and types of enemies that are attracted to your base. As well as structures or tools that harvest new/more resources.\n\nSo unlike traditional tower defense games, the waves are more organic and controlled by the player. If you want to upgrade your equipment/base, you need to build more lures, which requires better equipment/defenses.\n\nThis could even incorporate some degree of manufacturing and automation where you place towers that collect resources near turrets that kill enemies and then send those resources to factories to be processed."
mh5xy9,Chess with skins and animations,"One day, I just had this idea for an online chess game for PC but with fun skin sets and animations. Players on either end have the choice to toggle the skins on or off or toggle a symbol in the corner of a chess piece's model that shows what piece that piece is. Imagine playing chess but with fun themes or character models from other games. Like, one side of the board has minecraft slimes for pawns, Herobrine for Queen, Dragon Egg for King, Endermen for Knight, etc; and the other side has LoL minions for pawns, Nexus for King, Hecarim for Knight, Elise for Bishop, etc. Or to avoid copyright, just a simple steampunk toys theme vs cowboys theme.\n\nI just don't know if it's possible to make it so that anyone can make custom models and animations from their own computer and have those show on the other monitor. It's probably easy with 2D figures, but 3D animations would be so much more fun.\n\nAnother approach I had in mind was to have the developer of the game itself supplying the skins as DLC. Kind of like how skins work in LoL. But that would remove the players' ability to express creativity through the customizations.\n\nThe best approach is probably to make it similar to Tekken or Soul Calibur, where resources are available to all players who download the game and the game would just have to load them. This fixes one side of the problem, which leaves us with just the animation.\n\nI reaaaally would like custom animations. It's would be the butter if the custom models were the bread. But to have this happen, the game would have to be, in part, an animation program, where, after you finish loading in the model, you would have the option to animate the model for kill, move, die, and promote events with built-in requirements for each event (stuff like move loop animation must only last for 240 frames max). But this is probably too much for a simple chess game?\n\nInstead, I think the best compromise is to have a multitude of preset animations for the events. In a way, they're like skins, but instead of simple looks, they're the animations themselves. Preferably, there would be a lot of options like move sets that are sassy, or zombie-like, or robot-like, gunslingers, spell-casters, etc.\n\nNext, there should be the ability to have death-effects. Stuff like blood splashing all over upon killing or dying, or have chunks of the models just litter the board. Explosive effects, magical hex effects, burn, freeze, water effects, etc.\n\nLast but not least, is the ability to use flat 2D models instead of 3D. If the model is 2D, they will appear the same on the screen regardless of camera angle on the chessboard. Obviously, this would be much easier to render than 3D ones, especially with rules like maximum model size, maximum animation frames, and players would have full customizability on the figures since they'd be created from scratch.\n\nThis could be great."

mgoxqm,"A cute, calming, creative game where you live in space!","Imagine a game like Animal Crossing, The Sims 4, Minecraft, and Little Big Planet combined, making a completely custom world/avatar game for creative people, and you live in space. Features of the game would include building anything you dream of, Creating cute avatars with the best character creator, design your own clothes that you can wear or share to your friends, starting a farm for foods and flowers, and more. I'll go into more into more detail for each feature, I have a lot of ideas.\n\nBuilding- You can choose where you want to build, weather is on a cute pink planet with neon water, or a dark Purple cloud in the middle of space. Building blocks would be able to have different textures that you can change the color of. There would be a Snap Grid so every block fits into place, which you can toggle on or off. Premade items like fences, and chairs will be available, but if you wanted, you can make your own, and save them/ upload them to a gallery where others can use them.\n\nAvatar Creator- you can make your avatar extremely unique with tons of presets and sliders. For hair, There would be presets you can use, or you can make your own hair with individual parts for the front, sides, and back. Patterns like gradients, streaks, spilt color and more can be applied to any hair preset or part. Any hair that you've made can be saved and posted to a online gallery. For the body, You'll have the ability to change anything you want, Height, weight, don't want legs? have a mermaid tail! want more animal like features? Have ears and a tail! Wanna create a weird cat- mermaid species? Anything would be possible.(save and load body/species presets to the gallery).\n\nClothing design- Have you ever had a piece of clothing that you loved but you wanted it to be longer, or have puffy sleeves? No problem! in this game you can create your own Custom clothes with tons of parts! Sliders for length, tightness, and more will make sure you can create anything you want. Mirroring and be toggled off for more abstract pieces. Chains, belts, buttons, spike, feathers and more can be placed anywhere. Textures, colors and patterns can all be applied to any part of the clothing.  I'm pretty sure you've guessed it by now, but whatever you make can be saved, and posted to an online gallery. \n\nFarming- you live in space, so you need to farm your own resources! Fruits, vegetables, grains, flowers, and more can be planted! Discover new plants by mutating or breeding others together. Flowers look pretty, but would also have a important use! once you discover a new flower. you'll have an idea for a pattern! the pattern can be used for clothes and building blocks, Dyes can all be made! \n\nI've always dreamed of a game like this, I've gotten by with The Sims and Minecraft, but my creative side has been longing for a game where you can do what ever you want to. I would love to hear feedback, and ideas on what other features can be in the game. sorry for making this so long. If you made it this far, i hope you have a great day! :)"

What are similar games with equal „couch factor“?\n4. 	What do all those games have in common?  \n    \n \n\n 1.\n\n* Balanced gameplay (everyone uses the same character)\n* No complicated mechanics or counters\n* One of few multiplayer FPS of its time\n* Automatic balancing and learning feature in form of seeing what your enemy sees\n* Highly skill based game  \n  	\n\n2.\n\n* It was a license game\n* Pretty much every other splitscreen shooter took a page out of 007GEs book\n* Other forms of competitive shooters became more popular\n* Emerging online competitive scene\n* In the wake of onlinegaming splitscreen became some kind of a crutch\n* Extra development work\n\n3.\n\n* The Halo Series\n* The (early) CoD Series\n* Mariokart battlemode\n* Settler splitscreen  \n  	\n\n4.\n\n* Playing against each other\n* Seeing each others moves\n* Easy to learn hard to master  \n \n\nConcept:\n\nA  4 (maybe up to 12) player fast pased FPS game. The USP: You can see each other players screen live in the corner of your screen (/around your screen). This encourages players to “cheat” as it was called in the old days and peek on the other players screens. All while not loosing focus of ones own game and get pwned. The gamemodes and inner workings of this FPS are up for debate (maybe 3v3v3, classes, mirrormatches). Similar gameplay mechanics that kind of hint in this direction would be Tetris 99s enemy screens or Rainbow 6 Sieges camera system.  \n\nI was working this idea now for a while and the biggest problem I can see would be latency due to streamcompression if you stream the other players view or a pretty demanding graphics due to multiple different rendering angles at once. Alternatively a fixed delay could be implemented. Is this something you would like to play and do you see any issues with this concept in particular?"
mgm0eg,"A game that combines ALL simulators into one huge ""world"" simulation game","I've always had this idea that I thought would be cool, where all simulation games could be combined into one game.  \nSo for example: \n\n**Cities: Skylines** (a city-building and management simulation game where you build your own world and all of the facilities around it) could be the base game where you build your ""world"".  \nThen incorporate **American Truck Simulator** (a trucking simulator) so that in addition to building your own city, you can hop into a truck and drive around your own world that you built, transporting goods between all of the businesses and things. Then incorporate **Microsoft Flight Simulator** so that you can fly around your world, transporting passengers and cargo between the airports. Same thing with **Train Simulator**. Then you can incorporate **Kerbal Space Program** (a realistic spaceflight simulator) incase you want the government of your ""world"" wants to build a space program. You can build the rockets and explore other planets, allow citizens to colonize or do space tourism, etc. And speaking of government, you can incorporate **NationStates** (a political/government simulator) to handle laws, politics, and international affairs of your world. You can also incorporate games like **Planet Coaster** (a realistic amusement park building &amp; management simulator) or **Planet Zoo** (a realistic zoo building &amp; management simulator) to build your own attractions within the city and try to maintain it and convince people to visit them (and keep them profitable, etc).  \n\n\nBasically, an entire ""World"" simulator where every simulation game imagineable, is integrated into one system. And to top it off, It'd have some sort of multiplayer feature where you can have other people join, play in, and contribute to your world."

Using your advanced nano-tech you heal your almost fatal wounds. Thus begins your survival on this underdeveloped planet. \n\nSurprisingly, the planet is home to a thriving human civilization whose genetic code closely resembled your own. After studying a few of them, you discover a supernatural power that they use. Magic. This brand new knowledge, combined with your nano-tech gives you extraordinary strength.

Melee swordsman, magic woman, strigoi, nutcase, etc. Rip and tear...in style.\n* Werewolf - berzerker, druid-type (can summon wolves/bears), tank. Tormented soul. \n* Banshee/Ghost/Poltergeist - magic, ranged, support, evasion/curse specialist, traps.\n* Demon/Cultist - adaptable, jack of all trades, could worship different gods for different powers like elemental/flesh/plague/arcane/blood/mind trickery, etc.  \n\n* Necromancer - not sure I would actually include this as it's already a done thing in ARPGs to have 'good guy' necros, but could be cool to have a properly unapologetic evil necromancer as a main character, maybe as an NPC instead? Like Deckard Cain but evil. A Graveyard Granddad.\n\nWould require humongous convoluted passive tree for each so players can utterly break the game and make it a nightmare to balance.\n\nThen of course all the usual great ARPG loot, grinds, crafting, endless endgame, etc. Humour also welcome."

mfb8ay,"Transformer Gun - a VR shooter with only one futuristic gun, but you can manipulate it change its form by pulling, twisting, cranking parts of it around to transform it into different gun types.","Holsters and inventory systems in VR are a mixed bag. Either you carry items on your body (which can be awkward since VR headsets don't track the actual position of your torso and waist) or you have open pop-up inventories (which tend to be limited in space to prevent clutter). In either way the games are forced to limit your inventory and how many different weapons you can carry.\n\nBut handling guns in VR is surprisingly fun. The simple act of reloading by ejecting a magazine, inserting a new one and having to cock it feels good. So perhaps we can take this further.\n\nThe idea is sort of like the game *Control* which gave you a single transforming gun for the whole game, except you would manually transform the gun yourself by shifting parts around. You could transform from the revolver to the shotgun by flicking the cylinder out as if you were going to reload, then pulling the cylinder forward in front of the barrel and locking it in place. The rest of the weapon shifts around into the new form as you do this, and the cylinder becomes the barrel of a blunderbuss.\n\nYou might unlock weapon forms as you progress through the game, or the game could have all forms unlocked from the start and only *teach* you how to make them as you progress. Either way, the game could also have secret forms you can only discover by experimenting or finding hidden instructions."

I have nothing to work on these days and I was thinking if this should be my next project."

mf4u8w,anime game idea?,"Hello, \n\nYou know, I know a lot of people who are big fans of magical girl animes. And as someone who adores many titles such as ""Sailor Moon"" or ""Tokyo Mew New"", I have always wanted to step into that world and live out some clichés. I'm sure many people who watch anime have wanted to do that. And so I was thinking, why not make it a game? This was my idea:\n\nYou get to be an anime person \nYou can either be\n1. A magical anime character \n2. Ordinary character \n\n3. Archetype and personality traits\n4. Character customisation \n5. You get to decorate your house\n6. You get to choose a plot \n7. There is a romance storyline but there is an option to not include that in your plot\n\nIt could be a game also where like what you select will take you down different paths. So there's a lot of different things that could be explored. It would probably be really difficult to make and I know fuck all about making video games but I think it would be really fun to play."
mf4sj9,Among giants,"So the game is set in mythical Earth ruled by giants.Giants became so proud they start to call themselves equal to gods.\n\nGods declared a war on them and they want to teach them a lesson of humility.Gods resolution is to win a war by using lower creatures...such as humans.\n\nMeanwhile humans are on the level of simple apes.Able to barely survive in harsh conditions.\n\nYou as a player you descend from heavens and jump into a role of god of knowlege in human form.\n\nYou have to teach apes/humans how to light fire,make a spear,how to talk,how to cook you need to organise them in tribes....teach them everything.\n\nOut of that knowlege magic will emerge and some of the humans will be able to grasp it.You will learn about that magic also so you could craft magic objects and potions to use them or to give it to the humans to use it.\n\nYou could kill low level giants on your own but that is not the plan you are sent for and you could be recalled to heavens...game over for you."
mf3kth,You're wandering a sensory-deprived world and trading trash with strangers,"It's dark and lonely. You don't know how you got here, nor can you clearly describe your surroundings - everything seems to be a blurry mess. Same thing goes for your other senses - your steps feel like a muffled thump and upon touching things you can't feel anything at all.\n\nAs you're traveling further, you suddenly meet another person - a faceless stranger in an old suit. He observes you and takes out a small cube out of the bag on his shoulder and hands it to you. When you take it, the cube's sharp edges and rough texture pierce into your mind. Suddenly, the blurry mess around you becomes clear and sharp - you find yourself standing among the ruins of an unknown city. The cube in your hand is made out of concrete and rough to the touch. You glance back at the stranger, who's now showing you a accordion-folded piece of paper, with 2 lines visible:\n\n""**IT SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE LOST**""\n\n""**WOULD YOU LIKE TO TRADE TRINKETS?**""\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's a (possibly) horror-adventure game that revolves around MC returning back their senses, experiences and knowledge of the world. Just like a toddler gets to know the world around them, MC must also recover whatever they may find.\n\nDuring their travels, the Player can find ""trinkets"" - various items that return some of the ""experience"" to MC. The ""experience"" varies from item to item and consists of such things as color, shape, type of material, texture. The more trinkets the MC gets, the more ""experience"" is available to them - that directly affects how the Player sees the world.  \nFor example, if the Player finds something like a lightbulb, they get several ""experiences"" - of glass as a material and of its smooth texture. After that, the Player would be able to actually see and identify the objects made of glass in the world - that's going to help them in identifying possible dangers (like glass panels that would break under MC's weight and glass slopes that are slippery).  \nAcquired trinkets help the Player with correctly identifying the world around them, solving puzzles, making pathfinding easier.\n\nIf the MC dies, they lose some/all trinkets and have to find them again. Player would also be able to meet other NPCs and trade with them. Each NPC has a set of trinkets of his own and can trade with you."
mf39wc,Land Surveyor Game,"Ok so I'm a land surveyor and I really view my job as a sort of video game. I look through an instrument with crosshairs and accurately shoot a reflective prism all day. So I have an idea for a game that is essentially that. It'd be first person, you navigate crosshairs to follow an angry rodman man around. He stops and you have to line up the vertical line with the center of the rod and the horizontal line with the center of the prism. The game has a premade map that you're trying to replicate using the functions I mentioned. He can call out what you're shooting before hand and after the shot you have to remember what he said and select it in a multiple choice fashion. He also doesn't stay steady so you have to time your shot accordingly to complete the accuracy objective. You should have the option to retake the shot. The shots should have a clock timer and the longer it takes the grumpier the rodman man gets and the more he moves around. The descriptions are necessary to render your shots in the right layer so the final drawing is right. And that's about it. I think it'd be fun to play and as I lack the skills to ever make this game I'm posting it here in hopes that someone more adept could make it a reality. I also have more ideas for different levels and gameplay but I feel those would be harder to communicate. If anyone chooses to make this game all I ask is that you let me know where I can play it lol. And if you need anymore of an explanation as far as gameplay I'd be happy to oblige. Best of luck to anyone brave enough."

meykv0,Gimme coop puzzle game names!,"My idea is a out a coop puzzle game, like the we were here Trilogie.\nIt's not story driven. The rooms are randomly generated from a certain Set of rooms. You have to play together with your frend to solve the riddles an get to the next room. The theme can be totally different every time you play.\n\nOne time its a frozen setup, so you freeze to death when not fast enough, an other time, lave is flowing slowly into the room and press you to finish faster.\nMaybe one setup would be, the room gets darker and darker and at some point you See nothing at all. \n\nYou get the point 😉 i only need a good Name for it 😉\n\nMy first idea was like ""you SAW it coming"" but not sure about it."
mexhs1,Looking for a Twist on Robo Rally or Robo Derby,"I'm keen to make a game like RoboRally or RoboDerby, but I am looking for a twist to make it more interesting and so it can be played in solo mode. \n\nRobo Rally lets you preprogram 5 moves for your robot in advance, as you race to collect flags before other players. Turns repeat until all the flags are collected.\n\nStatic items on the board/environment can change the intended actions in various ways (conveyor belts, pushers, lasers etc). Having other players adds ""hidden"" unintended consequences (collisions etc).  Without the other players, the game seems lie it would be too predictable. I dont want to get into writing an AI.\n\nThere doesnt seem to be any modern commercial versions of the game, and I can't figure out why. \n\nAnother idea is to create a robot war platform where you could define rules for your robot to fight in the arena. In the 1981 there was a Mac application called RoboWar (google the Wiki page).  By creating a script, you could teach a robot to fight. Eg turn 5 degrees, check if target in range, fire etc. because each person write their own script, they could use different strategies to beat other robots.\n\nIt had quite a following and leader boards etc - but nothing seems to exist by more.\n\nIt would be a good app for schools to teach programming. I know there is Mindstorm - but software would be waaaayy cheaper...\n\nFeedback and ideas would be appreciated"
mevhy0,"Souls like, musou like, RTS game! very impossible to make....","Imagine, if you will, a game set in a fantasy world or a place with magic and shit, where you play as a random dude, in the beginning you are weak as balls and the game plays kinda like a souls-like (you roll/dodge and pay attention to every enemy) but in the middle of the game, somehow, your protagonist becomes some kind of god (in story) and the game becomes a musou game with DW empires like grand strategy and by endgame your protagonist becomes so powerfull that he does not even need to be in battle to use his magic in it, then the game becomes some kind of RTS game with skills like Battle for middle earth 2 and you oversee your troops like the god you are (maybe the game can even have a skill that lets your character manifest himself in battle for some seconds and wreck the enemy)\n\nI would love to play a game like this but it's clear that is something impossible to make."
mev6tk,"2 ideas to extend autobattle genre - One general , one specific","General one, think of Warcraft where you build up a starting town.   You do that in a turn based system and choose your first buildings, get units etc.   You'd have stuff like mage tower, soldier barracks, alchemists guild, etc/  basically different factions that have different heroes to choose from.    You choose heroes from those buildings' offerings.    \n\nThe first battle is the ""center"" of the map, an area not controlled by either player, and it is an even playing field much like any autobattler's grid design.    The winner then is on offense, the next battle is somehow more defensible for the losing player.    If they lose again, the final battle is at the base of the losing player. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSecond idea, specific one.    Instead of drawing from a pool of the entirety of heroes, what if you crafted a deck of your own beforehand like in Hearthstone.   Furthermore, adding ""priorities"" to the unit cards - Such as ""attack lowest health"", ""nearest unit"", ""healer"" etc.    \n\nThat's all - Let me know what you think, I haven't fleshed out either idea fully.  Cheers!"

mess4n,Strategy empathic surreal game:,"  The whole part from what I gathered is your whole being is mostly to connect to other peoples feelings and emotions but there are different puzzles and locations you can only gain from interacting with individuals or completing different tasks and only a few you can gain from yourself. \n\n  You slowly work your way up from being around modest true people to fake people where you can't really get your emotions from them but from the scenes around you and this seems to be in a Kingdom(almost like those Staircases from abstract paintings were used to warp and make houses) and the creature you play as looks almost human and everything almost looks like it is in a skybox but not really, mostly in the clouds? \n\n   Your character gets to the top to maybe become a King but they can't gain the emotions anymore with people faking emotions by them. Empathic people with some issues with their own emotions sometimes say they can't feel truly right by themselves but mold their emotions easily around other people sometimes and I feel after reading that and having those feelings myself this came into being."
merqfq,First person colony management with survival elements (Valheim+Rim World),"Hello. It’s my first time posting here. My English isn’t very good, but I hope it’s not a problem. Here is the idea...\n\nWhy isn’t there a game like Valheim/Rust but with NPCs that can be assigned different tasks (Rim World)? But unlike Rim World you play as a single leader character who can walk around to interact with things, eat food, have conversations (that affect people’s mood), do any action that NPCs can do.\n\nYou build a village, send groups of people to find resources or even create a squad and go explore world while your village keeps living its live.\n\nI’m not sure about the UI. Can you assign complex tasks without the “bird eye” view, but by talking to characters?\n\nThis came to mind while playing Valheim and imagining NPCs doing “boring” tasks like loading ovens, planting carrots or even hunting.\n\nI understand that it would be technically difficult to implement NPCs in a game like Valheim because of physics and world complexity, but I can see it as a simplified 2d top down thing too (or isometrical 3d-ish like Don’t Starve). Maybe we should sacrifice RimWorld-like character depth and have stupid builders/followers/killers NPCs? Would it still be fun?\n\nWhat do you think?"

mm9epv,Colony-Sim Mechanics in Sandbox/Survival Games,"Sandbox games like *Valheim, Rust*, or *Minecraft* are fantastic for what they are. However the world tends to feel a bit empty and after a certain point of development, the grind feels kinda pointless even in a group.   \n\n\nI would like to see npc serfs/villagers/refugees flock to the secure ""lifestyle"" built by the players, exchanging security for labor. That way, in exchange for managing a small-scale supply chain and defenses, this adds an extra layer of endgame complexity and replayability. It also adds some multiplayer dynamics such as trading/warring/allying with one another rather than the inevitable ""you do job x and I'll do job y"". \n\n*Medieval Dynasty* does this to a degree with some interesting mechanics and ideas, but their application of theory is a bit too slow-paced in my opinion and the scope is focused in more of a medieval life sim. A better application of colony-sim on a survival game is in some mods. *Minecolonies* or *millenaire* in *minecraft* is a good place to start looking at examples in my opinion.  \n\n\nHow would one make the colony-sim element simple and lightweight enough to implement into a survival/sandbox game? Any development resources, mechanics tutorials, or related examples? What would your ideal game with this kind of genre look like?"
mm6wla,Non-Euclidean Puzzle/Sandbox,"I propose a non-euclidean geometry puzzle game, (how original), where you progress through the same level sections with the use of infinite doorways. But the twist is that every time you return to the same opening there are different items -and possibly different routes?- you can use to get to a different area and checkpoint. The game could be set in an alleyway/city and could also include a sort of creative/sandbox mode where you can use portal/doorways and building tools to create your own levels and can save them for other people to play."
mm47ow,Space Engineers x Guns of Icarus,"I made a post a little while ago about a game focusing on ship repair during a battle. It was fairly similar to something someone else had posted, but there were a couple of interesting ideas.\n\nThis builds off of that slightly. I've been playing Space Engineers a lot recently, and I've had a great time. But the game definitely has more of a survival / faction multiplayer focus. I don't really care about survival games; I play most sandbox survival games in creative mode, SE included. What intrigued me about SE was the potential for capital ship battles with fighter escorts, but sadly this feature is largely inaccessible without multiplayer. Sure there are npc ships running around, but they'll rip you apart if you play by yourself.\n\nSo what if there was a game like Guns of Icarus / Sea of Thieves with a focus on ship to ship combat set in space. \n\nProper three axis 3d manoeuvres with fleets of capital ships and fighter escorts.  Three classes: Captain/crew, Pilot, Engineer\n\n-Captain/Crew flies the capital ship and mans cannons\n-Pilots spawn in a ready room and deploy in fighter escorts. Have to land back in the ship periodically to resupply.\n-Engineer responsible for repairs and rerouting power to subsystems. Most of the repairs would be on the outside of the ship with engineers welding the hull with magboots while the battle rages around them.\n\nVoxel destruction is out. Replaced with panels to repair and sections of the ship that break off. Maybe mild deformation like cars in GTA; mostly cosmetic. Some damage sustained may be permanent and will carry over in next battles until repaired at a station or ship explodes.\n\nInstead of focusing solely on multiplayer battles with menu screens in between, ships can warp in and out of battle from a lobby resupply map. This area would be more PvE and feature more survival mechanics to resupply ammo and fuel and food. Players would also be able to dock at a space station to buy more equipment or a new ship altogether.\n\nThis game may already exist. Guns of Icarus is already 90% there, just missing the setting and fighter escorts, but the last I heard, servers for that game were mostly dead."
mm3gzl,Shield combat similar to Superhot,"I was thinking of a game where you, presumably in first person, could throw your shield to defeat enemies as well as ricochet that shield and pull it back. You could also block bullets with that shield in a fashion similar to Superhot.\n\nThis game would theoretically be in short, sequence-based levels with predetermined enemy placements and weapon outfitting.\n\nYour character would be one or two shot kill, to emphasize the importance of blocking bullets, and the enemies would be one shot kills with the shield.\n\nThis game would have very simple graphics, few separate guns, and a short array of levels that could be added onto later."
mm2mp4,Pixelated Platformer set in different dimensions,"Hey  Guys\n\nI have an idea for a pixelated platformer/puzzle game where you play as a a guy who has to interact with other versions of himself from different dimensions. and use their various abilities to overcome obstacles. \n\nStory:\n\nThe game will focus on a character named Dave who just a normal everyday person minding his own business. His world is forever changed when he is given a watch( or some other device) which allows him to travel between dimensions by an scientists version of himself from an alternate dimension. Dave is tasked with helping Scientist Dave recruit other Daves in the multiverse to help defeat an evil version of Dave who is trying to destroy the multiverse.\n\nGameplay:\n\nLike I said earlier the game will be mostly a platformer(imagine something like Castlevania). You will have the ability to switch between any Daves you recruit on your adventure using your watch and each Dave will have an ability that will be useful for solving puzzles or defeating certain types of enemies. (Example: A medieval knight Dave could have a shield that blocks certain attacks and allows you to reflect lights) . \n\nSo far I have few ideas down for various dimensions that Dave could travel to such as a Medieval dimension, a Noir dimension and a Sci-fi Dimension and I have already noted ideas for what some of these Daves' abilities would be. I just wanted to know if anyone else had some great ideas for characters and worlds that could be included in the game and if there is anyone would would want to collaborate on this."

Also there could be a mechanic where you can time travel in the middle of a race to take shortcuts.\n\nThis has been a dream of mine to do but I will never be able to do that.

mlwqsd,Trying to make the newest big game in Roblox,"Currently the hottest game played right now is an Adopt Pet game, which was not there 2 years ago when I played. This tells me that games actively switch around and I’ve seen them in popularity vary daily. With good advertisement, new (or maybe old but re-designed?) concepts, simple but fun gameplay but also addictive in a good way and rewarding you could probably make a really popular server (or at least build traction to then build more games and get a reputation type deal) and if your making even 4K players daily and you have cosmetics and purchases could make some good money. This idea excites me and I’ve made games before on GMOD not cause I liked the game cause I saw it was stupid but fun and you could make a server and made some good money off of playing like I normally would. I want to learn some roblox development , I have okay experience in multiple languages, I’m a freshmen comp sci major  and learned a few other languages on my own on the side, so learning lua seems like it isn’t out of this world. Not say it’s not gonna be a pain, but nothings impossible right? \n\nAnyways as regular gamers or potentially even roblox gamers yourselves what sort of game ideas, or genres/concepts attract you. Story games? Short/fun paced? Complex? Simple? Etc.\n\nWhat sort of games have you wanted to be seen done but haven’t or remade well now and better and improved? \n\nThe game could be easy, medium, hard or dream-like to make, just curious as to more of what’s culturally attracting people more. Like to me it’s fascinating analyzing how games like among us sort of explode then sorta lay low and die slowly and same with fall guys and you see this cycle of potentially making some decent money off of doing something fun, challenging but something in which you can express creativity and art.  \n\nJust looking for any tips or comments or opinions and advice idk, lmk what you guys think or have to say !"
