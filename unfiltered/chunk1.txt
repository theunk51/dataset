oue7x2,Genshin Impact meets Demon Souls,"The open world, adventurer style of Genshin Impact and the combat of Demon Souls. A massive, open world, with the idea of being an adventurer or mercenary to take on jobs for money and experience for the player level and reputation. Ranks for the players that are affected by the beasts they kill and the jobs they complete. Different weapons and spells and miracles to help fight and allies. If there is a game like this, I don’t know"
oubbk0,i need game ideas," I want to make a game on par with stardew valley, spiritfarer, and a short hike. I don't really know how to describe the aesthetic but I've heard some games like it described as cozy, if anyone has any ideas or even mechanics there okay with giving up that would be great"
oua3k8,"I had a dream about this game, so I wrote down what it was.","3D modelled world, complete with cities, towns, farmland &amp; forestry, also on the waters edge. \n\nAirfields &amp; Aircraft carrier (both allied and enemy ones) are in several locations around the map. \n\nThe “missions” (actually just maps) have 100 missions each, ranging from things like “Defeat the 5 enemies that are patrolling this area of the map”, “A building in this area of the map needs to be destroyed” ect And after each mission completion the next mission automatically starts, there is only manual save and no automatic checkpoints, saves can only be made when landed at a base. \n\nEach map has a boss, at missions 50 &amp; 100, which has you in a dog fight against an ace pilot. \n\nEach mission completion rewards you with money, so does each enemy you destroy, landing at a base also gives you the option to upgrade your aircraft, with damage/armour upgrades, armour, weapons, damage repair, refuelling (as yes, your aircraft will lose fuel overtime), aircraft selection (as there will be multiple planes to chose from) and finally cosmetic liveries. As well as, crew! You can train, upgrade and purchase crew members to help, such as a fighter that constantly follows you, crew members to help put out fires your plane may have, man the machine guns, and a navigator who will automatically spot &amp; mark enemies on screen for you. \n\nGeneral features \n- enemies bases will constantly spawn enemy planes unless destroyed.\n- Flyable aircraft are only bombers, enemy planes and allies are in fighter aircraft. \n- Landing at an enemy base has a chance of taking it over. \n- And I’m sure there probably would also be a story throughout the game."
ou8fhu,Standalone deathrun game,"Hey guys, I used to play a lot of cs 1.6 deathrun a couple of years back for those who don't know it's a game mode about avoiding traps triggered by a player while jumping over obstacles throughout the map.\n\nI thought it would be a great idea if someone could make a standalone version of it with the same movement system as source games (like bhop and surfing), tell me what you guys think."
ou7dq4,"Door kickers meets cRPG (Baldurs gate, PoE, etc.)","I know there are a ton of cRPG's out there, but I think it would be really interesting to really take the tight tactics of door kickers and use a wizards kit for instance to breach a room with a fighter or paladin guarding the doorway and then moving in. \n\nBasically cRPG with more intense tactics and much lower health pools"

ou33a6,Open-World RPG that takes place in a flooded version of Earth.,"Imagine an open world single player RPG that takes place on a flooded version of Earth.\n\nIt would be a first person game with melee and ranged combat.\n\nYour character will have a vessel they can upgrade; defense, range, speed as well as the ability to transform it into a shop or bar or anything like that.\n\nThere would be floating settlements and structures all around the map which would house characters, factions and quests.\n\nThe game would be very exploration focused which leads me into the next part.\n\nYou would be able to explore the underwater ruins of the cities of the old world.\n\nJust think of exploring a sunken Venice (im sure that you will be able to do that in real life in a few decades) or exploring an underwater Amsterdam or some random skyscraper.\n\nThere would be a bunch of factions and enemies.\n\nThere would be a ton of room for DLCs that take you to famous landmarks, like NYC, Paris or Tokyo and allow you to explore the ruins as well as the civilization built ontop of it.\n\nI already have a bunch of factions planned out in details if anyone wants to hear then for fun or inspiration.\n\nThank you for reading."
ou2xio,A game based around different peoples perspectives in a certain memory,"So I'm gonna make a lot of this up on the spot, because the core concept is based around how different people remember a particular scene completely differently, picking up on different details and whatnot, which could make for an interesting game idea, but I've only just thought of this so here goes with the improvisation...\n\nYou're a cop interviewing witnesses to a crime scene, say a bank robbery, and with each witness, you play out their memory of the same scene, but things are completely different based on how they remember it. One person remembers something that others remember differently (say a woman in a blue dress involved somehow, but everyone else either remembers a green dress or no woman at all) some people's versions are insanely detailed, resulting in a level with lots of props and interactions, whereas others are very limited in detail, resulting in a very bare level with next to nothing going on outside of the main crime. Some people's details lead to new evidence, and new witnesses (such as finding out the identity of the woman in the blue dress and interviewing her), and other people's details lead to dead ends because they've completely fabricated false memories by misremembering things. And some people's memories are so ridiculous and imaginative, like they claim ninjas broke in and saved the day or whatever, so you think they would be wrong about everything but their memories may include small details that are actually relevant, such as overhearing a criminal mention where their hideout is or something.\nYour job is to get to the bottom of it and work out which details are important to follow up and which are completely useless, and ultimately use all of this information to nab the bad guys.\nEach memory is and individual level which is repayable, complete with secret collectibles galore, some unlocking new witnesses and furthering the story and as the collectibles are essentially the details used to determine what is fact and fiction, you have a ""drawing board"" of all the collected details which you can review between levels with an element of puzzle to it, or even use in other interviews during conversation (like ""ask about the woman in blue/green""). And in the drawing board segment, you have fellow cops who you can present some of this evidence to to see if they know anything (maybe you got an item that was found at the scene, so a colleague suggests checking the serial number and locate where and when it was purchased and by whom etc, or maybe a witness' memory shows a partial tattoo they noticed on one of the robbers, so your colleague knows of criminals in the database with potential matches of that tattoo). Maybe details picked up in later ""levels"" can be used in earlier scenes to unlock a whole host of new information, and may even alter the level itself.\n\nAnyway, that's the top and bottom of it. You play cop and gotta separate useful and useless information via playable witness accounts in order to unlock new interviews and progress the story, or unlock other fun secrets as bonus content.\n\nFeel free to try to make this happen."
ou2jpg,Exploration game,"You’re a captain during the age of exploration and a little bit after. \n\nYou have the choice 4 different areas to explore. The Arctic, Temperate regions (North America/China), Tropical (Central/South America, Africa, India and Indonesia) and Southern (Australia, Antarctica). When you select a region, you are given an optimum time period to start in based on when exploration was most common (Arctic 1750-1900s, Temperate 1500-1700s, Tropical 1450s-1700s, Southern 1750-1900s). Each region will have strengths and weaknesses. The Arctic will be slow, dangerous, and unpredictable but the natives are nice, lower amount of disease and your crew will be more loyal. The Temperate will be average speed, decent weather, and easier to explore, but the natives are more hostile and your crew is more likely to mutiny and there is a higher risk of disease. The tropics is the fastest travel time, decent weather, and most prosperous, but the natives are extremely hostile, most likely region to be mutinied, and highest risk for disease. The southern region has slow travel speed, unpredictable weather, and crew who might mutiny but less hostile natives, fewer natives, and more food. You can explore anywhere in any time period but the lack of technology or the area already being discovered will make it harder. \n\nIn order to set sail, you need money. You will be able to host dinners, balls, and plays to help receive funding from beneficiaries. You can also ask the rulers or scientific organizations for money. Once you gather enough funding, you are able to purchase supplies, buy ship(s) and hire crew members. Each crew member has a different skill set including loyalty, health, age, adaptability, familiarity of region ect. The amount of money you raise to buy supplies is up to the player. \n\nNow it is time to set sail. You will leave from a random port in the country where you originate from. You will be able to choose your own journey and where you go and land. Now you are at the mercy of the sea. \n\nOnce you land in a temperate or tropical region, you will be able to create a colony. You won’t spend much time on the colony since you will have to return home, but you will be able to check in on them and see if they are doing well. You will be able to create colonies in the arctic and southern areas but they are less successful (except Australia). \n\nIf you discover something new you can name it after anything. Monarchs, crewmates, or beneficiaries are recommended. Islands, ponds, lakes, settlements can all be named. \n\nYou can return and report your findings. If they are satisfactory they with me might give you funding for another trip. If you don’t do well, getting funding will be more difficult. \n\nHow it ends. You can either retire and it shows you all the area you explored, or you die from the countless ways sailors died back then."
ou23h3,Game ideas physics already working,Hi there I'm looking for an idea for  a game to do with some physics I've been working on in unity. It's a ball that you can ping around like a slingshot via touchscreen. When your aiming the direction of the ball time slows down and if you hit something dangerous you die. I'm not that artistically talented so I'd like to keep the character like this and I'd like it to be simple enough to be a mobile game.\n\nAll Ideas are appreciated as I am stumped :)\n\nEven if its something completely different

otsxsi,we need a gta online multiplayer type game but in a cyberpunk or watch dogs type game.,"i think this would be awesome. in a perfect world, it wouldn’t be a cash cow like gta online is to rockstar, and it could be more like a cyberpunk cityscape than los santos. crazy vehicles like the akira bike or crazy sci-fi APCs with railgun turrets on the roof.\n\nand i think there could be a lot done with this idea. things like incorporating watch dogs 1 multiplayer ideas almost in a dueling style, like you could hack another player to steal money from them (a small limit, like mugging in gta) but then a timer starts, and the hacker has to be stealthy to avoid identification by the target. or little ideas for side quests like having actual characters run stores (weapon stores with guns and swords, implant workshops where you can purchase and upgrade your character’s implants) and storeowners need you to collet items or take care of some loose ends.\n\nthere could even be npc gangs like in watch dogs 2 or cyberpunk 2077, and quests could involve them too. there should be a main story imo but it shouldn’t be required to progress in the gameplay if the rest of the world. apartments and garages could be crazy considering the strange architecture of most cyberpunk cities. i have a lot more to say about this idea but i don’t want to write a whole essay lol.\n\nTLDR: there should be a gta online styled game based in a cyberpunk world with a story that is well made but not required to continue the game."
otq8dt,I have one that would need a lot of work.,"My idea is a GTA type game in the day but Dying Light type at night. Meaning in the daytime, it’s just a free roam game where you can buy apartments, guns, etc. but at night these creatures come out and you can either go in your apartment, stay and hide, or stay and fight. I am trash at making games so I need someone to spread this word and make this idea come to life"
otpvar,Police Department 1983,"FPS with 80s action movie theme. Emphasize on fun semi realistic gun mechanics and gore. Very scummy bad guys, sex and violence. \n\nLevels could include . A cocaine bust in Miami, waves of bad guys coming at you in a warehouse, as your chain gun mows them down sending powder and blood into the air . \n\nA jungle level infiltrating a South American arms or drugs dealer .\n\nGangs in NY or LA. Etc etc\n\nBiker gang in Texas kidnaps the presidents daughter. You gotta go in solo and take them out !"
otpqyf,cyberpunk souls like game,i just thought of a game that could be pretty cool. have it set in a cyber punk noir world but make it as difficult as the soulsborne series. have all of the upgrades and weapons including body weapons such as mantis blades from cyberpunk 2077. feel like this could work
otli3y,My dream game idea,"I want to make a card game for desktop where you have 4 heroes and you strategically fight boss after boss as gameplay. The story would be communicated with cutscenes and after you'd beet a boss, maybe you'd gain special potions and powerups for your heroes. Every boss would be unique in personality and abilities.\n\nI'm not hoping to get rich off the game but, it would be nice to see my dream game come to life. Is this worth pursuing as a game project? Any constructive criticism would be nice."
otl5l6,Text-based RPG/MUD using 3D Text in 3D World...,
otkz82,Text-based RPG/MUD using a 3D Text in 3D World...,"Hello All. I developed a 3D Text Subsystem to display [Player Stats directly on Characters body](https://youtu.be/ccPKgsLuADs). For [my game](https://thegamedevstore.com/v2/dragon-gold/), I'm going for all 3D UI, zero 2D. \n\nIronically, I'm expanding the debug console/logging subsystem to translate 3D Input/Output Events into Text and [Audio](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/google-speech-kit).  The loggin subsystem effectively converts the 3D game into a Text-based game. \n\nThen it dawned on me, with markup to define additional Audio/Visual effect, I could regenerate Text output with my 3D Text ([1](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/864556498272780309/864560067659563038/unknown.png),[2](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/864556498272780309/864559770235830272/unknown.png),[3](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/864556498272780309/864559901040443392/unknown.png)) in a 3D Game world.\n\nSo ultimately the game has 3 ways to play. On top of all this, Players can pay a small fee to [export their in-game objects to 3D and 3D Print formats](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/runtimemeshimportexport) such as: fbx, stl.  \n\nThese 3D objects can be used in other 3D games as game dev asset. 3D prints can used for tabletop games and collectibles."

op885f,Randomly Generated story game,"Would anyone play a game that every time you restarted all the ai, shops, cities and pretty much everything changed?\nYou would build a storyline in one play through where you join a faction and they have randomly generated rivals and motives, then if you want you could restart and everything would be different. \nAll ai have different attributes that are randomly assigned and you can interact with all of them some of them may have things for you to do, some of them may despise you completely despise you. \nLike entering an randomly generated AI world, with no specific storyline until you create one. \nPlease drop a comment if you like the idea."
op5axx,Turn based party type game,"I want to make a game I could play with my friends where each person takes turns. It doesn’t have to be like an RPG, or a fight, just something casual like a party game. I also want characters to be significantly involved somehow, like they have different advantages or something. But it would have to be one person at a time, and it couldn’t be a card game of any sort cause everyone is looking at the same screen, and you wouldn’t be able to hide your cards. What are some game genres or ideas that would fit this criteria?"
op3yar,A life sim or romance sim thats like GTA but way more of a casual game?,"I've always wanted to find a game that was open world, mainly casual gameplay, has romance and is in first person. \nLike if The Sims, GTA and a Bethesda game were merged together. Kinda. Basically a game with the casual-ness of The Sims, the graphics and pov of GTA, and with like companions and some romance stuff, like a Bethesda game. Not a whole lot of combat involved, if any, and it would mainly focus on immersion and everyday life. NPCs with backstories and unique personalities that you can befriend, bring along with you, romance, etc. I guess it would have to have some sort of storyline too, for people to be interested. \nI'm no game developer. I'm just constantly searching for games that are similar to this concept. I love casual gameplay but I also love RPGs. I guess I just wish there was an RPG that wasn't so combat-heavy and was more immersive."

oozhfx,I’d love to make a game based around sound with someone,"Hello, an Idea has just popped into my head whilst I was brainstorming and I think it could be really cool if done well. Perhaps even a franchise based around senses.\n\nBasically, the game is based around sound with minimal amounts of graphical aspects (otherwise it wouldn’t work). You have to listen carefully to even the quietest of sounds so that you can try to find out what happened to you before you had a coma. My inspiration is before your eyes since the story will be the same sort of structure.\n\nThe game would last somewhere between 1-4 hours so that you could do it in one sitting. I’m not sure about the details so I’m open to suggestions. Let me know what you think!"
ooqkp9,A James Bond game that uses Alpha Protocol as a template,"Super Bunnyhop pointed out that Hitman is the best Bond game for the aforementioned reasons, and IO Interactive is currently making a Bond game. However, I believe that crown goes to Alpha Protocol. \n\nAlpha Protocol, despite its flaws and glitches, is the only game I felt like playing as James Bond. My ideal game would be remaking Alpha Protocol into a Bond game, featuring the Daniel Craig model, a few script changes, bug fixing, John Barry score (or David Arnold score), and the functional combat system. Throw Blacklist's gameplay into here, and I would not play anything else anymore."

oon3vl,A game about storming a terrorist filled tower with only a baton,"It's called BatonForce. Basically you are a member of a SWAT team, who, despite his superiors' orders, storms a building filled with terrorists. The negotiations have ended and you are only one against the enemy.\n\nBasically you use the baton for most of the time. You smash windows, whack terrorists and do all kinds of cool action-movie shit with it, like reflecting bullets, use it as a bat to hit smaller items as projectiles and such. You can also take dropped weapons off the ground, empty the whole magazine into an enemy and hit the empty gun towards another.\n\nAbout 100 floors, saves after every floor, yadda, yadda. The environment is highly destructible and you can even break holes into walls with explosives and shotguns."
oom9zo,A single player FPS where you play as an exterminator,So basically people pay you to help get rid of pests in their homes by shooting them.\n\nBut your company has a strict no property damage policy: The client gets some of their money back every time you miss and accidentally shoot their furniture or walls or ceiling or whatever.

oom36h,A hero shooter/platform fighter hybrid,"I'll list down the elements the game uses from each genre\n\nTeam Shooter:\n\nObjective-oriented game modes (Capture the flag, Payload etc.)\n\nLarger Maps\n\nRespawn points\n\nMove cooldown (No ammo packs, it reloads by itself)\n\nTeam-based, obviously\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlatform Fighter:\n\nThird-person 2D fighting game viewpoint\n\nDirectional moves (which direction you input decides which move you use)\n\nKnockback\n\nPlatforms\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere would be a mix of ranged and melee fighters\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOther ideas:\n\nCombo Mechanic: When you successfully land an attack the cooldown for its next use is halved.\n\nRespawn portal: When you die, you are transported to another map where you must reach a portal to respawn back into the game. Attacking enemies in this map will knock them back, which can stop them from reaching the portal"
ook551,A game like Golf Clash but for math?,"Thoughts on this idea:  \n\nGolf clash is amazing.  You play 1vs1 in golf holes, each player taking a turn.  The winner wins all the coins and trophies. To enter a game you need a certain amount of coins and trophies, and the higher the level the harder the holes are and the more you win.\n\nI want to take the same concept and apply it to math!  You play a random person 1vs1.  It costs X coins to enter the match, you each get asked a few questions, and the winner gets all the coins.  Coins can be used to unlock new levels, buy fun math things that help you in the game, new skins, new avatars, etc.   Can do everything from really simple arithmetic questions to more complex stuff.  \n\nI think the game could be a lot of fun to play and practice math skills, and can be used to learn and introduce new concepts. \n\nCould also be really fun to do the same thing with coding problems.  You enter random games with people and compete to solve a quick coding problem - kinda like the social network movie interview process.\n\nWhat do you think? Any feedback would be awesome!"

oo22eg,An FPS equivalent to Smash Bros.,"Basically, a first person multiplayer deathmatch, where players can choose between famous FPS protagonists, like Doomguy, Gordon Freeman, Chell etc. and gameplay would depend on which character you play, matching their respective games, with a few minor tweaks for balance.\n\nGame Mechanic Examples:\n\nDoomguy can use the SSG's Meathook to grapple other players, but unlike Doom Eternal, the players can still still move around, but slower.\n\nGordon Freeman can use the Gravity Gun to pick up and launch props found around each map.\n\nChell can use the Portal Gun to move herself and others around the map, typically trying for environmental kills or fall damage kills. Also she doesn't take fall damage.\n\nAny thoughts on this idea? New character and mechanic suggestions perhaps?"
oo18a3,Open world monster evolution game,So I thought about this for a minute now but I have a game idea that’s different so the game is a open world monster game so u start off as a weak monster who escapes a lab you must try to eat and consume humans or animals every chance you get but you will be hunted every time when you first start off you’re this humanoid small monster who must sneak around to eat on animals in the lab while you’re being hunted by security than after consuming enough you can evolve and customize what aspects you want such as armor to not take a lot of damage or claws or the ability to fly or breathe under water and you level up every chance you get by consuming and causing mayhem you will also be dealing with other monsters that escaped and must find and kill them around the city you will go form a small 4’10 monster to the size of Godzilla if you level up through the whole game
oo0il8,Game concept - The Long Road / Space truckers journey turns into sci-fi horror," Hi guys! First time posting, so please take it easy if I'm doing something wrong.\n\nHere is game concept - basically it's linear story about space adventure. No new mind blowing mechanics, but I was trying to make more or less solid world where story for this game fits.\n\nMight seem like a lot of text, but I'm going to split it into different sections and I hope it's gonna make it easier to read. Here is link to google doc file with world backstory and general game idea:  [https://docs.google.com/document/d/11z-cEu8LPEgB6gcQJNbJewpQplgWy9GRdgK2iYHp86I/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11z-cEu8LPEgB6gcQJNbJewpQplgWy9GRdgK2iYHp86I/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nAnd let me make clear one thing - I didn't go to describe all those different actual gameplay mechanics like - what exactly main character will use as his weapons, or what type of upgrade he can install, or what type of enemies game will have - yet, because the purpose of this concept is describe what exactly this game is about. I believe before you go to all technical details you should define the main idea of the game and what are you trying to say to the player.\n\nSo please let me know if you think this story is shit, or maybe you liked it but you'd change or add something. Thank you for your time!"

onrlsj,A New Gen VR RPG,"Hello there, thanks for droppin' by to read!   \n\n\nI am Marshal and something I desired since I've gotten a VR system was an RPG that felt right. Having multiple paths to choose, personalization(Character creation), and a good combat mechanic. The last time I played something that reminded me of my idea was Dynasty Warriors, a great RPG series. Or Conqueror's Blade, a good MMO RPG.  \n\n\nNow, my idea.   \nThis is a first person VR game. A constant throughout the game will be you will fight as the commander and you will fight alongside your troops.  Your decisions will directly affect the performance of your Army and overall Kingdom.\n\n It is a game where you play as a strategist/commander in a fictional land. You build up the character you are, such as picking the personality, looks, and even the upcoming of your family(Being a commoner or royal). After the selection there will be a tutorial explaining mechanics, how the states are at war, and side characters. Maybe even a mock battle?\n\nAfter the tutorial you will be on the road to protect your own state, talk to other states to avoid conflict, grow bonds, or declare war. Below is a list of features that the game would be based off. We will call these the ""Rules and Guidelines of the Kingdom""\n\n1. Every state you fight there will be different enemies abilities, looks and equipment), aspects. The size of your army, the haul of food, and the location itself (being near a river or other geographical perks) will come into play when you converse with diplomatic personnel. \n\n2. You must make sure you do not run low on these four core things, Food, Army, Population, and Morale.\n\n3. During the conflict you may have to sacrifice one of the core items to elevate another, this would be based off your own strategy and Army construct. \n\n4. Each Army will have to equip their Army with default communications, weapons, transportation, uniforms, armor and skill level.\n\n5. You will have the ability to increase the default levels based on achievements e.g. kill streak, staying alive for a certain period of time or after a battle. These increases can be applied to any default level item. \n\n6. You will have the ability for you to play as your commander or conscript, depending on tasks and battle performance this will lower or increase your units morale. \n\n7. This game would not have levels. You will not fight to get to the next level instead you will have milestones. Once a pre determined goal is achieved you would have the option to advance your kingdom/society according to one of the four core values (Food, Army, Population and Morale).\n\n8. There will be a metric where you can marry a leader of another Army, this would create an alliance in order to share all resources of each Kingdom.\n\nEndgame Ideas:\n\n1. you will start to face harder enemies, spies and rebellions within kingdom based off in-game morale.  As Morale increases the less likely rebellions will happen and vice versa. \n\nIn the end once you have taken over all of the states the game will end with the player choosing to rather end the game at that point or continue it. If you end it there, a cut scene will appear showing the kingdom stats and then credits. If you continue the game, the game will have more rebellions and a new enemy will appear and the game will continue."
onqxwl,Assassins Creed spin-off game that plays like a combo of AC and Hitman.,"The AC story wouldn’t be tainted at all by this but this idea definitely builds off of both of those titles. \n\nThe game would be called “Animus” rather than AC. For those that are unfamiliar the Animus is the machine in AC that can recreate the memories of people from the past and let you experience them as if you were actually there. \n\nIn the new Hitman World of Assassination trilogy- agent 47 finds himself in 20 different ‘destinations’ across the globe, with different targets in each. Each destination is a total sandbox, you can assassinate your targets in any way you can think. You can unlock different weapons and starting locations by mastering each destination.\n\nOk now that some of the background info is out of the way. My idea is that rather than a destination, your character goes into the animus to a certain time period. Your character would play as an ancient assassin in an ancient setting, like the coliseum or pyramids, or Great Wall of China. And you’d assassinate real people that actually lived and were assassinated, and you’d be using real historical weapons to eliminate your targets."
onqmr2,Realistic pizza delivery sim,"Sounds boring at first glance but I've driven a wrx for delivery for years and I get in to a lot of street racing while delivering. I've been thinking about an idea for a more realistic not nfs type delivery game where you take deliveries but also have the chance to race people while you're at work like drags and short sprints and also after work for more cash.  \n\nI like the idea of a realistic base for money like maybe taking out a loan to buy a better car and pay the loan back at the penalty of your ""heat"" raising against the police or something. I have a thousand more ideas but wanted to make this post as short as possible"
onlg2z,"A monster hunting game, but the game is designed so that 90% of the battle is planning and preparation. No leveling up; no unlock trees; just going out into the world to get the things you'll need for the battle plan you've come up with.","I like Monster Hunter, Dauntless and a number of other monster hunting games well enough. What I *don't* like is the grind. The vast majority of those games is spent leveling up gear and stats, and picking up random ingredients strewn about the map(s). This game will replace that with something a little different.\n\nLike *Breath of the Wild* you're given one and only one objective: Defeat the END BOSS MONSTER.\n\nYou can't level up or make ""stronger"" gear; however, the boss monster is weak to X weapon, susceptible to Y traps, is impaired by Z poison, and it inflicts reduced damage to N armor. You'll have to defeat four different boss monsters to get the materials needed to make those items. And each of those monsters will have their own required gear that you'll need to defeat smaller monsters for.\n\nEach monster is a small puzzle. Other than the END BOSS MONSTER, you aren't told what the monsters' weaknesses are or what strategies to use. You'll have to figure them out on your own by observing them, stalking them, researching/asking about them in town, and by fighting them underprepared to test out strategies. Once you have it figured out, you gather your gear, drink some expensive temporary buffs and put your strategy to the test.\n\nIt's important to point out that no gear makes you stronger, per se. You can only beat monsters through smarter strategies and better skill."

onh6i7,Game concept - The Long Road / Space truckers journey turns into sci-fi horror,"Hi guys! First time posting, so please take it easy if I'm doing something wrong.\n\nHere is game concept - basically it's linear story about space adventure. No new mind blowing mechanics, but I was trying to make more or less solid world where story for this game fits. \n\nMight seem like a lot of text, but I'm going to split it into different sections and I hope it's gonna make it easier to read. So let's go:\n\n**The Long Road** \- game about space truckers adventure.\n\n*Main idea*\n\nDefine for yourself - what do you understand as a reality? Would you agree to live in a world of dreams, live through adventure, experience all emotions and be ok with it knowing that it's all going inside high-tech VR machine? Life is a process of getting experience and emotions. Any emotions and feelings are real for you as a person, as long as you are aware of where you are and who you are, regardless of what world you are in. So is there any difference between them?\n\n*Elevator-Pitch*\n\nHave you ever experienced derealization? Maybe even for a second couldn't understand whether you were dreaming or not? What do you say if you stay in that second forever? \n\n*Setting* \n\nFuture world. Big spaceship with a cargo going through a long journey to another stellar system. Such journeys are possible all because of the new technology which allow to a space ship use space-time shrinking to quickly travel to a long distance. But as all technologies this one have some limitations. Ship couldn't travel to  any destination though a one jump, there was a possible max distance and very long engine recharging process. But because of this, space travels which before took several dozen thousands of year now only take 20-40 years to most of the systems. Even though space travel progressed dramatically in terms of time they occupied, they still took a pretty long time for a human, so all ships aimed to travel far should have been equipped with hibernate capsules. When a ship travels during engine recharge brakes, which even with most modern models would take 5-10 years, all crew members should be passing waiting time in those capsules, and when engine recharged all crew should be awake to manually control the next jump. Jump usually took 2-5 days depending on a engine model and travel distance.\n\nIn our journey ship crew  have to deliver very important cargo from one point to another and along with it test new hibernate capsules which would allow to crew members not to lose time between jumps in unconscious dreams but use this time to experience different experience in preliminary prepared virtual sceneries to stimulate their brain activity and prevent brain degradation. This degradation was known as a ""professional"" sickness of space truckers. When a person spent several dozens of years in a capsule some parts of the brain were degraded too much and after a journey the whole crew had to take 1-2 year of break to restore their health to be able to travel again. New capsules should have fixed that. \n\nIt's a long journey though a cold dark space inside a tin can where you can't leave. You can't make this journey faster. \n\n*Plot and world backstory*\n\nFuture. Humanity made a breakthrough in space travel. First engine which able to affect space-time is developed. Using this engine you can make jumps through a really long distance. Thanks to this technology this was a start of a ""far"" space exploration era. This engine had his limitation though. You can't travel to any point in a space, just to limited maximum amount of distance. When engine was created limit was about 0.5 light years. Recharging process of that engine would take about 15 years. \n\nFirst hibernate capsules were developed a bit earlier and were used in solar system exploration travels. They also have been used on pilgrim ships - special ships with a crew who agreed to have this one-way trip to the closest star systems with habitable planets. \n\nTechnology developed with time. Humanity domesticated more and more systems with time. Engine development allowed it to increase distance but recharging times still were pretty long. Most modern engines still would take around 5 years to recharge. Private corporations \n\nplaced their production facilities over many different systems allow communities there to grow. To transport goods, supplies and people corporations tried to use autonomous trucks at first, but pretty quickly realized that during jumps the ship becomes too unstable and needs manual control. Also those trucks pretty quickly become an easy target for a space pirates. It was obvious - ships needed a crew.\n\nThat's how space truckers came to life. Small groups of people were sent on a several dozen years journey. During flight crew usually used working shifts and were always divided into groups of 2 people - pilot and engineer. When the engine recharges each group at some point has to be awake to monitor ships systems and make sure the recharging process goes without issues.\n\nIn our journey crew got new assignment from a head office. They are getting brand new “truck” with the newest hibernate capsules. They should pick up and deliver very important cargo to a pretty distant stellar system. Along with delivery they have a ""small side quest"" -  test new hibernate capsules. Those brand new capsules instead of putting a person in an unconscious dream allowed him to experience different sets of emotions in prepared scenarios in order to stimulate their brain, so after a trip crew wouldn't need time to restore their health. But crew members don't know that you have to be very careful with playing in those scenarios. It might suck you in if you don't stop it at the right time. Some of the scenarios have dangerous side effects which might affect your mind. \n\nOur crew doesn't know yet that their side quest is actually the main purpose of this trip and who knows where it's gonna get them.\n\ndialogue somewhere from the game prologue (just for better narrative feeling)\n\n\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\n\n\- Hey Bob! Did you hear those corp rats giving us new truck for some important trip? Heard they installed new version of sleeping machines which should help us to not get stupid by the end of the trip as usual, what do you think?\n\n\- Wow, that would be cool. I wanted to pay off my shithole apartment in sector 7 for such a long time. Wouldn't want to spend another year trying to get my brain back working.\n\n\- Yeah, I also heard they didn't test them yet, but listen...it's good isn't it? They promised to pay twice more for this trip. I don't think those corps would want us to die if that cargo is so important, it should be easy.\n\n\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\n\n*Main character and his abilities*\n\nMain char - member of the crew, mechanic. His abilities is his professional skills, he knows how to fix ships. Also all crew members go through combat training to be able to protect ship from pirates, so they have some combat abilities as well. His equipment will contain universal tools which would help him to work with ship systems and also a  gun with two shooting modes - shotgun and pistol.\n\n*Gameplay and mechanics*\n\n2D adventurer shooter with pixel art style. Closest references Hyper Light Drifter, The Last Train.\n\nPlayable character fixes the ship, fighting with whoever is trying to get on the ship. Living though VR scenario uses - you'll see some peaceful ones, some with fighting or some other actions and some horror as well. \n\nWhen you awake you have a hub/central room which is kind of a safe room where you can upgrade your equipment, get some quests, make some customization and then goes to a part of the ship where you need to go.

onh0m3,Game concept / The Long Road,"Hi guys! First time posting, so please take it easy if I'm doing something wrong.\n\nHere is game concept - basically it's linear story about space adventure. No new mind blowing mechanics, but I was trying to make more or less solid world where story for this game fits. \n\nMight seem like a lot of text, but I'm going to split it into different sections and I hope it's gonna make it easier to read. So let's go:\n\n**The Long Road** \- game about space truckers adventure.\n\n*Main idea*\n\nDefine for yourself - what do you understand as a reality? Would you agree to live in a world of dreams, live through adventure, experience all emotions and be ok with it knowing that it's all going inside high-tech VR machine? Life is a process of getting experience and emotions. Any emotions and feelings are real for you as a person, as long as you are aware of where you are and who you are, regardless of what world you are in. So is there any difference between them?\n\n*Elevator-Pitch*\n\nHave you ever experienced derealization? Maybe even for a second couldn't understand whether you were dreaming or not? What do you say if you stay in that second forever? \n\n*Setting* \n\nFuture world. Big spaceship with a cargo going through a long journey to another stellar system. Such journeys are possible all because of the new technology which allow to a space ship use space-time shrinking to quickly travel to a long distance. But as all technologies this one have some limitations. Ship couldn't travel to  any destination though a one jump, there was a possible max distance and very long engine recharging process. But because of this, space travels which before took several dozen thousands of year now only take 20-40 years to most of the systems. Even though space travel progressed dramatically in terms of time they occupied, they still took a pretty long time for a human, so all ships aimed to travel far should have been equipped with hibernate capsules. When a ship travels during engine recharge brakes, which even with most modern models would take 5-10 years, all crew members should be passing waiting time in those capsules, and when engine recharged all crew should be awake to manually control the next jump. Jump usually took 2-5 days depending on a engine model and travel distance.\n\nIn our journey ship crew  have to deliver very important cargo from one point to another and along with it test new hibernate capsules which would allow to crew members not to lose time between jumps in unconscious dreams but use this time to experience different experience in preliminary prepared virtual sceneries to stimulate their brain activity and prevent brain degradation. This degradation was known as a ""professional"" sickness of space truckers. When a person spent several dozens of years in a capsule some parts of the brain were degraded too much and after a journey the whole crew had to take 1-2 year of break to restore their health to be able to travel again. New capsules should have fixed that. \n\nIt's a long journey though a cold dark space inside a tin can where you can't leave. You can't make this journey faster. \n\n*Plot and world backstory*\n\nFuture. Humanity made a breakthrough in space travel. First engine which able to affect space-time is developed. Using this engine you can make jumps through a really long distance. Thanks to this technology this was a start of a ""far"" space exploration era. This engine had his limitation though. You can't travel to any point in a space, just to limited maximum amount of distance. When engine was created limit was about 0.5 light years. Recharging process of that engine would take about 15 years. \n\nFirst hibernate capsules were developed a bit earlier and were used in solar system exploration travels. They also have been used on pilgrim ships - special ships with a crew who agreed to have this one-way trip to the closest star systems with habitable planets. \n\nTechnology developed with time. Humanity domesticated more and more systems with time. Engine development allowed it to increase distance but recharging times still were pretty long. Most modern engines still would take around 5 years to recharge. Private corporations \n\nplaced their production facilities over many different systems allow communities there to grow. To transport goods, supplies and people corporations tried to use autonomous trucks at first, but pretty quickly realized that during jumps the ship becomes too unstable and needs manual control. Also those trucks pretty quickly become an easy target for a space pirates. It was obvious - ships needed a crew.\n\nThat's how space truckers came to life. Small groups of people were sent on a several dozen years journey. During flight crew usually used working shifts and were always divided into groups of 2 people - pilot and engineer. When the engine recharges each group at some point has to be awake to monitor ships systems and make sure the recharging process goes without issues.\n\nIn our journey crew got new assignment from a head office. They are getting brand new “truck” with the newest hibernate capsules. They should pick up and deliver very important cargo to a pretty distant stellar system. Along with delivery they have a ""small side quest"" -  test new hibernate capsules. Those brand new capsules instead of putting a person in an unconscious dream allowed him to experience different sets of emotions in prepared scenarios in order to stimulate their brain, so after a trip crew wouldn't need time to restore their health. But crew members don't know that you have to be very careful with playing in those scenarios. It might suck you in if you don't stop it at the right time. Some of the scenarios have dangerous side effects which might affect your mind. \n\nOur crew doesn't know yet that their side quest is actually the main purpose of this trip and who knows where it's gonna get them.\n\ndialogue somewhere from the game prologue (just for better narrative feeling)\n\n\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\n\n\- Hey Bob! Did you hear those corp rats giving us new truck for some important trip? Heard they installed new version of sleeping machines which should help us to not get stupid by the end of the trip as usual, what do you think?\n\n\- Wow, that would be cool. I wanted to pay off my shithole apartment in sector 7 for such a long time. Wouldn't want to spend another year trying to get my brain back working.\n\n\- Yeah, I also heard they didn't test them yet, but listen...it's good isn't it? They promised to pay twice more for this trip. I don't think those corps would want us to die if that cargo is so important, it should be easy.\n\n\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\n\n*Main character and his abilities*\n\nMain char - member of the crew, mechanic. His abilities is his professional skills, he knows how to fix ships. Also all crew members go through combat training to be able to protect ship from pirates, so they have some combat abilities as well. His equipment will contain universal tools which would help him to work with ship systems and also a  gun with two shooting modes - shotgun and pistol.\n\n*Gameplay and mechanics*\n\n2D adventurer shooter with pixel art style. Closest references Hyper Light Drifter, The Last Train.\n\nPlayable character fixes the ship, fighting with whoever is trying to get on the ship. Living though VR scenario uses - you'll see some peaceful ones, some with fighting or some other actions and some horror as well. \n\nWhen you awake you have a hub/central room which is kind of a safe room where you can upgrade your equipment, get some quests, make some customization and then goes to a part of the ship where you need to go. When you in VR you have similar concept with a safe room/home in the center. Pretty peaceful place. But also you can choose and go play through different scenarios in that world to make it more interesting for you to spend that time. Each finished scenario gives you the ability to upgrade your central hub, your abilities in VR world, will give you more information about that world and what stays behind it.\n\n*Targets*\n\nPurpose:\n\nGet to the final point with cargo and don't go crazy.\n\nTactical:\n\nProtect ship and cargo, fix ship, find out limits of your mind in VR scenarios. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n...OK, if you made this far, sorry for your time :)\n\nActually I'd love to see your comments about this concept. And let me make clear one thing - I didn't go to describe all those different actual gameplay mechanics like - what exactly main character will use as his weapons, or what type of upgrade he can install, or what type of enemies game will have - because the purpose of this concept is describe what exactly this game is about. I believe before you go to all technical details you should define the main idea of the game and what are you trying to say to the player. \n\nSo please let me know if you think this story is shit, or maybe you liked it but you'd change or add something.

n78liq,Extremely Dark and Traumatizing FPS Idea,"The idea started with playing CoD and realizing most FPS games don't spend any time on the actual character you are using in war, each life you use in combat are basically just disposable body suits.  The core concept of this game idea is making each life in the game matter and immersing deeper into the stakes of that soldier.  \n\nWhen a soldier you control dies, there could be a reel or small cutscene of the body being carried off, the medals they've earned, etc.  Each person deserves a send off/epilogue.  Perhaps the longer you stayed with a soldier and did stuff, you could see more of the cutscene, possibly even seeing their son or daughter grow up and enlist themselves.  The game would take a moment to mourn for that soldier and then continue to another new life.\n\nPlaying through a whole battle and surviving would definitely be rewarded.  Keeping your soldier alive and valuing each life would be core to the game.  Gameplay would most likely be slower and more tactical, as everyone is trying to win while keeping their person alive.\n\nIs this messed up and possibly traumatizing? Depends.  But it's certainly better than disregarding soldiers' struggles and the value of each of their lives."
n77y4t,Need an idea for a 3D game with anthropomorphic vegetables,"Hey there! I'm an intermediate blender and unity user and I finally want to work on a somewhat original idea for a game. I've been working on a 3d model of a tomato that kinda looks like the one from veggietales except I plan on giving him buff arms and legs. I'm looking for 3D game ideas that could make good use of the comedic value of a buff tomato or a fire breathing chili pepper. Ideas don't have to a funny tone, I'm open to serious games too. Honestly, anything is appreciated just give me an idea! Thanks in advance!"
n6yu99,A multiplayer exorcism game.,"Greetings everyone, recently I have been playing Phasmophobia, which is kinda cool as a concept. For those of you that don't know its a game all about ghost hunting. \n So I came up with an idea similar to that game but instead of Ghosts you are hunting different types of Demons. The purpose of the game is simple: Exorcise the Demon and trap him with different ways sealing him forever. \nThe whole game basis wraps around the principles of exorcism. Players can use different types of equipment to harm the Demon and defeat him once and for all. The twist in that matter is that the Demon is also a player.\n So as a group of 4 you fight against a player who is actually playing as the Demon. The player controlling the Demo can use different types of tricks to confuse the players while dropping their sanity levels. \nAs a player's sanity level drops he becomes mentally unstable starts seeing things and hearing things  and once it hits zero can't be targeted as a victim by the demon killing him and claiming his soul. \nGame can include different famous Demons of Christian religion each one of them with different type of powers and abilities, but also weaknesses.\nWhat are you guys thinking about this? Is it interesting as a game idea? Any suggestions?\nThanks in advance."

n6o6nf,Integrating HP/MP bar (or stamina) into the character.,"I want have a discussion about not having HP/MP bars in games.  \nMost games comes with a standard HP and MP bar (sometimes stamina bar too), usually HP mean Health point, MP means Mana Points for skills-usage.  \n\n\nHowever, players are often required to shift attention back and forth between their own character model and the HP/MP UI during combat. I think instead of displaying these status meters as UIs, merging them with the character provide a more pleasant gameplay experience.  \n\n\n# Taking away the HP bar\n\n  \nI've seen FPS games do this by making the screen edges more red/dark as the character get more hurt; some survival games make the character slower or look tired; MMORPGs tends to shrink the hp bar and hover it above the model's head.\n\n  \nI don't agree with how these both decisions give the player disadvantages as their health drops: making the screen harder to see (and spot enemies), take away the player's normal speed, or having small version of the UI.  \n\n\nFor the player's own HP, make the model change stance and look bloodied as they get more damage; break or gradually crack their armor/shield if they have protection. For the enemies' HP, I would say do the same. In PvP games, not knowing exactly what your opponent's HP are allows for a higher skill ceiling in competitive plays. When spectating, if there are dozens of players to keep track of, not needing an ui bar above everyone's head or at the edge of the screen should also improve the viewing experience.\n\n# Taking away the MP bar\n\nFPS Mobas replaces them with cooldowns and again, the MP UI is just replaced with another UI to keep track of.\n\nI propose adding different effects/glows/weapons and on and around the character to indicate which skills are available to use. For example, if your character has ""Fireball"" off cooldown, the character can voiceline something like ""I'm ready to fire"" and have their right hand glow in flames or a fireball hovering next to the character.\n\nThe only place I think this wouldn't fit is in MMORPG, where one can have upwards of a hundred skills available, displaying effects to the character will just create a clutter of glows. \n\n# Issues\n\nThe main downside I see with using effects, animations and voice lines in place of UI, is that one will no longer be able to tell exactly how much points they have left.  \nI think a good compromise is to make these UI visibility toggleable with a button, so that knowing the exact number will not be vital to survive/play well but optional in case the player wants to see it.\n\n  \nWhat do you think? I want to hear if anyone have any alternative solutions."
n6hr24,"First person perspective, motorcycle game with this cool stylized, intense color graphics (e.g. Firewatch, The First Tree)","Hi! I have this idea for a game, that I don’t even have time to begin Unity’s project with (but I would love to help with/make the story writing though):\n\n- core mechanics: \n   - riding motorcycle with first person perspective (this simply have to be a pleasant, reactive/responsive, intuitive experience);\n   - travelling by foot, with a few simple, but well designed mechanics like: picking things up, throwing things, moving levers, usage of the ropes, opening/closing valves (I hope you get the idea :D)\n   - RPG mechanics, like dialogue system, equipment, simple quest system (without overkilling it with a complex solutions)\n\nset&amp;setting:\n- stylized graphics, with that dreamy, surreal vibe (e.g. Firewatch, The First Tree);\n- linear plot (I’ll be able to handle that part of the game, if you’d like to realize this project :));\n- semi open world (many little areas that would be connected with each other via single roads) - it may be silly, but Pokemon Yellow’s seems like something I have in mind in terms of connected areas\n- music-type proposals: \n   - Pink Floyd, Massive Attack, anything from the mainstream lo-fi beats type for the driving between areas\n   - Audioslave, Metallica for the intense moments (prefferably chasing or something similar)\n   - no music for the walking by foot, in order to create this weird, unsettling feeling when Player gets of the bike\n\nGameplay overview:\n\nFor some reason we have to put this poor guy on the motorcycle, so I’d like to see this introverted character with plenty of self-analysis going on while free-roaming through beutifully crafted sceneries.\n\nWe also would need to give the player something to play with, so I’d like to see plenty of small interactable objects, like some branches in the woods, cups from the coffee shop laying around on the pavement. And of course, if there is a branch to be picked - there have to be any type of object to be poked with it\n\nWhat’s the main issue of the bad games? Poor core mechanics - therefore I’d like to see some arcade steering with this feel like you’re a pro (something like Forza Horizon, but with a motorcycle)\n\nWhat’s the second main issue of the bad games? Lame main storyline. Give the main character a soul and purpose to ride on this bike from area to area, e.g. his mother is really sick and he has to travel through entire country, and he has no regular job, and has to do some jobs for the locals, so that he can fund the fuel for his motorcycle. But there’s also this sense of purpose, like if the Player’s spends too much time in one place, then, for instance there could be a call from main character’s sister where she would insist on him, because the condition of their mom is worsening (if that’s a real word).\n\nAlso I would love to see this game designed for the mobile first (mostly because I don’t own a gaming PC) :D\n\nStay safe &amp; best wishes, hope you get inspired and give me something to play (or work on, wink wink) 🙏"
n6dasp,Gratuitous Opinion Battles,"I have been studying social theory, psychology, sociology and linguistics for a number of years in order to figure out how to use technology to combat the increasing decline in reading comprehension, rational dialogue, respect, empathic awareness and many other social problems identified by analysis of social data.\n\nI had an idea for a game in which a person can choose a style of battle and then that battle plays out based on the rules of logic and debate based in background analysis of NLP (Natural Language Processing) and NLU (Natural Language Understanding / sentiment analysis).\n\nOnce initiated, the bot would pull archived information on a topic from a database compiled from social media data analytics.  It would then use the compiled footprint of that social opinion to generate a scene in which the OP of an opinion position is placed with armor or unit dispositions linked to the underlying premises of the philosophical position.\n\nValid arguments are ""targeted"" based on clear use of language, reference to the premise, grammatical use, punctuation, spelling, etc...  The strength of armor or force positioning comes from cited sources and evidence.  The confluence of a well thought out, cited, referenced and well written rebuttal is interpreted as a hit, possibly critical, that destroys the targeted defense.\n\nAbandoning the argument is equated to quitting the field.\n\nIgnoring a premise or argument is equated to failing to deflect an attack or shot and/or possibly a failure to mitigate damages (such as in a naval battle).  In unit battles it would be equated to failing to rally troops or reinforce units, potentially resulting in the unit being routed or dispersed.\n\nIn essence, it's a fun way to have AI moderate debates based on trained analysis of professional dialogue.\n\nThoughts?"
n69h58,Message Routing Game,"Concept: Players are blind and connected randomly in a communication network. They can only send messages to their direct neighbors. Each player has to send a message to a specific person somewhere in the network, so everyone has to cooperate to get the message delivered.\n\nIt would be possible to insert malicious players, randomly dropping messages by changing the reliability of channels, limiting the speed of communication, having messages that shouldn't be read by specific persons, and creating more interesting tasks/themes.\n\nDoes anyone have more ideas on how to expand on this abstract concept?"

n5tpo0,[REVISED VERSION] My Co-Op Fantasy Game's Player Characters [LOOKING FOR FEEDBACK &amp; SUGGESTIONS],"This is a revised version of my previous post that lacks any descriptions with comparisons to other games. A user told me that when I share concepts or ideas, I shouldn't describe them with comparisons to other games because I would immediately alienate people who haven't played those games. I'm really ticked at myself for doing that in the first place, and I hope this revised version will pick myself off the ground (in other words, raise my chances of getting feedback and suggestions so I can move forward in my journey to make this game happen).\n\nAnyways, here we go...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst of all, I've had this idea for a Co-Op Fantasy game since 2020, and it would be a cross between First-Person and Third-Person. The most notable mechanic I've thought of for my game is that there are 4 player characters that you can switch between.\n\nI've done some thought process on what differences should each character have, such as different species, abilities, and traits, but I feel like some things need work.\n\nI'm having trouble with coming up with special abilities which would only be activated when their ""special ability"" meter is full by getting enough kills, and scenarios where you would need to switch to a certain character in order to progress through a level. Those are the two things which I think I need suggestions on.\n\nI apologize if the post itself seems childish even though I'm a senior in High School because I still feel like I'm new to grammar, and these character drafts are just my first impressions, and I'm sure many of us know that first impressions usually need more work and aren't the final.\n\nFirst of all, general mechanics:\n\nYou can switch between characters by pressing a certain hotkey assigned to whatever character. Each character carries three weapons: their own unique weapon, a crossbow with finite ammo that needs to be scavenged, and and empty weapon slot for whatever weapons you might find that you can pick up. Each character can be incapacitated, and you will have a certain amount of time to revive them depending on the difficulty level. If they die, they will respawn within 60 seconds.\n\nNow, here are for the player characters. They are in order of which I would place them from left to right on the character selection screen. They are addressed with code names since I don't have names for them yet and I wouldn't spoil their names. If anyone has suggestions for additional abilities and/or ideas for the two things I mentioned that I'm having trouble with, let me know:\n\nYeti Berserker:\n\nThe first character is a male yeti berserker. He has slow speed, but a lot of health. His primary weapon could be a two-handed, two-sided battle axe. If he sheathes his axe, he can pick up objects and pieces of debris that can be hurled at enemies as an alternative way of attacking.\n\nCabbit Warrior:\n\nThe second character is a female cabbit warrior. She is naturally the fastest of the characters, but has a lowest amount of health. Her primary weaponry consists of two one-handed swords that are dual-wielded. She comes with a sprinting ability that has a cooldown function.\n\nKitsune Mage:\n\nThe third character is a male kitsune mage. He would have the second most amount of health, and be the second slowest character. His primary weapon would be a staff that can cast various offensive and defensive spells (Which is one of those things I need suggestions for) as well as a healing spell that can heal the other teammates. He can also use the staff as a melee weapon, and has a meter ability to revive deceased teammates early so that they can respawn immediately rather than wait 60 minutes.\n\nDragon:\n\nThe fourth character is a female anthro dragon (in other words, dragon girl). She would have the second-least amount of health, and be the second-fastest character. Her primary weaponry consists of a combination of her claws as melee weapons and her ability to breathe either fire or ice in many forms (The forms are also something I need suggestions on). She is also capable of flying, so she can reach areas where the other three characters can't, but it is a cooldown ability to prevent her from reaching/touching the level boundaries.\n\nThat's everything I've thought of so far for all of the characters.\n\nI'm open to feedback and suggestions for additions to my player characters, especially for the things that are missing. If any of the things I already mentioned need to be changed or removed, don't hesitate to let me know, I might consider it . If you have any questions, let me know.\n\nThank you, and I can't wait to hear your feedback and/or suggestions. Again, I'm sorry for describing my concepts/ideas in the original posts with comparisons to other games. If you like them, you like them. If you don't like them, you don't like them. Like I said, I just hope this revised version picks my feet up off the ground."
n5thcs,Among Us -like game where you either kill or protect Hitler,"Kill Hitler.\n\nThere are 8 players on a map. 2 CIA agents, 2 SS agents, 1 Hitler, and 3 randoms. \n\nThe CIA doesn't know which player is Hitler, and must find and kill Hitler to win.

They don't know who the CIA agents are and must protect themeselves as well.\n\nThe CIA however can't kill Hitler directly and must sabotage the tasks Hitler will do to kill him and win. The sabotaged tasks however don't just kill Hitler, but will kill anyone who uses it. \n\nThe SS can also also get notifications on sabotaged tasks, where they are, and can un-sabotage the tasks. The SS can kill the CIA directly by simply shooting them.\n\nHitler and the 3 bystanders don't know anything about the CIA and SS battle and are doing tasks around the map."
n5t9ko,A Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas type Action-Comedy Open-World game,"Think Saints Row 3-4 meets Looney Tunes. Okay in that sort of vein,but I hope you get the idea. Set in a fictional city. Think a Las Vegas-Tokyo Casablanca esque crime infested city. To clarify, Casablanca,the way it's portrayed in the film. Laugh out loud type humor with some meta, here and there,but not in that irritating Deadpool sort of way. Regular weapons will be used, like revolvers, shotguns and machine guns; the kind of weapons Hunter Thompson used. Explosives will be there too. It would be sacrilege to not include them in a game based on a somewhat true story of his. There will be drugs, real and fictional, to act as power-ups. LSD will be rare and an extra special power-ups. Clothes will be vast, wild and offbeat. There will be vehicles but strictly from that era and fully customizable. Enemies and friends of HST's will be the antagonists and co protagonists. Obviously they'll be exaggerated versions of themselves. Other figures could be added or they could be DLC's. I'm not sure what the main objective will be. I'm also sure about mini games but I want them to be fun and something different. If anyone has suggestions for things to add, please let me know."
n5qgo6,My Co-Op Fantasy Game's Player Characters [LOOKING FOR FEEDBACK &amp; SUGGESTIONS],"Hello, hello, helloooo.\n\nI'm feeling bored right now, and I feel like sharing what I have so far for my fantasy game's player characters.\n\nFirst of all, I've had this idea for a Co-Op Fantasy game since 2020, and it would be a cross between First-Person and Third-Person. The most notable mechanic I've thought of for my game is that there are 4 player characters, and this was inspired by Left 4 Dead.\n\nI've done some thought process on what differences should each character have, such as different species, abilities, and traits, but I feel like some things need work.\n\nI'm having trouble with coming up with special abilities which would only be activated when their ""special ability"" meter is full by getting enough kills, and scenarios where you would need to switch to a certain character in order to progress through a level (this was inspired by Lego Star Wars where you would need to switch to a droid to use a panel to open a door, or switch to a bounty hunter to blow up shiny bricks). Those are the two things which I think I need suggestions on.\n\nI apologize if the post itself seems childish even though I'm a senior in High School because I still feel like I'm new to grammar, and these character drafts are just my first impressions, and I'm sure many of us know that first impressions usually need more work and aren't the final.\n\nFirst of all, general mechanics:\n\nYou can switch between characters by pressing a certain hotkey assigned to whatever character. Each character carries three weapons: their own unique weapon, a crossbow with finite ammo that needs to be scavenged, and and empty weapon slot for whatever weapons you might find that you can pick up. Each character can be incapacitated just like in L4D, and you will have a certain amount of time to revive them depending on the difficulty level. If they die, they will respawn within 60 seconds.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, here are the characters themselves in order of which I would place them from left to right on the character selection screen. They are addressed with code names since I don't have names for them yet and I wouldn't spoil their names. If anyone has suggestions for additional abilities and/or ideas for the two things I mentioned that I'm having trouble with, let me know:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYeti Berserker:\n\nThe first character is a male yeti berserker. He has slow speed, but a lot of health (I guess you could say he's like Roadhog or Heavy). His primary weapon could be a two-handed, two-sided battle axe. If he sheathes his axe, he can pick up objects and pieces of debris that can be hurled at enemies as an alternative way of attacking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCabbit Warrior:\n\nThe second character is a female cabbit warrior. She is naturally the fastest of the characters, but has a lowest amount of health (I guess you could say she's like Tracer or Scout). Her primary weaponry consists of two one-handed swords that are dual-wielded. She comes with a sprinting ability that like the sprint armor ability in Halo Reach, has a cooldown function.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKitsune Mage:\n\nThe third character is a male kitsune mage. He would have the second most amount of health, and be the second slowest character. His primary weapon would be a staff that can cast various offensive and defensive spells (Which is one of those things I need suggestions for) as well as a healing spell that can heal the other teammates (so he can be like Mercy or Medic). He can also use the staff as a melee weapon, and has a ""meter"" ability to revive deceased teammates early so that they can respawn immediately rather than wait 60 minutes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDragon:\n\nThe fourth character is a female anthro dragon (in other words, dragon girl). She would have the second-least amount of health, and be the second-fastest character. Her primary weaponry consists of a combination of her claws as melee weapons and her ability to breathe either fire or ice in many forms (So she can be like Mei or Pyro. The forms are also something I need suggestions on). She is also capable of flying, so she can reach areas where the other three characters can't, but it is a ""cooldown"" ability like the jetpack in Halo Reach to prevent her from reaching/touching the level boundaries.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's everything I've thought through for all of the characters.\n\nI'm open to feedback and suggestions for additions to my player characters, especially for the things that are missing. If any of the things I already mentioned need to be changed or removed, don't hesitate to let me know, I might consider it . If you have any questions, let me know.\n\nThank you, and I can't wait to hear your feedback and/or suggestions."

n5og5c,Can someone help me with a Multiplayer Game idea?,"The tittle says it all,A Multiplayer Game  Idea is needed to make a game for a small college project."
n5ljq3,First Person Choice-based SAW Game,"With how polished first-person horror looks, RE7 and RE8 as an example, imagine a first person game based on the Saw franchise similar to RE7. With the added realism, there could be a really emotionally compelling nature to encountering other people in traps rather than straight gore. I think an interesting gameplay loop would go like this: the world is an open-ish labrynth where you have to solve puzzles and do certain tasks etc. to open new parts of the world. Your main goal is to reach some end point but throughout doing so, you encounter many persons in their own traps. You can use some resources or risk your health to save them, or play it safe; maybe some people you don't help but escape their traps come after you later. Also, this may be too grotesque but perhaps the player character has some device on them that kills them if they don't take another life within a certain amount of time. So during playthroughs you'd be navigating this open world and encountering others in traps and have to, for example, kill one other person every hour (probably by deciding their fate in multi-person traps) or your game resets to an hour prior.\n\nI know this is effed up but also sounds like a compelling experience only the game medium could bring."
n5l1w4,Squad based arcade-shooter/moba pitting 4 teams of 3 against each other.,"Hello everyone, first off I just want to thank anyone who reads this for giving it the time of day.\n\nMy idea would be to make 4 teams of 3 human players either eliminate all other players or capture an objective and return it to their spawn. They would be dropped into diagonally mirrored map which would feature a central raised platform, which contains the capture objective, 2 opposed small towns with houses for looting weapons and lastly 2 more opposed shops which would allow for spending of money gathered between rounds.\n\nMy main focus on this was giving the teams options that they can all choose and have to think about their opponents choosing as they moved throughout the map. Will they start straight to the store and buy up? Or will they head into the town and loot it. Maybe they might try and sneak the objective back to their base for a cheeky victory. All these things would require strategy as the team moves through the map trying to gain victory. I figure this could be round based, maybe first to 3.\n\nSo what do y'all think?"

n5hqzk,Need your opinion,"So i got this really basic idea:\n\nThe player is a male/female that lives alone in a small house with his/her dog. So you go tho the park and walk with your dog. But then your dog finds a wallet with strange coins and an address and you decide to return the wallet to the owner. When you arrive at the address you see that the house is very old but you still go inside. This part is bit weird i know :) when you open the door you see a huge portal that stands in the middle of the room. Of course your dog walks through it and you have no other choice then to follow the dog. The portal brings you to a forest. Your dog is running and you follow him till he stops at the end of the forest and you see a futuristic city with lots of lights. When you get into the city. You will ask someone where you are and stuff and he tells you that the coins in the wallet come from this place. Soon you realise the person from the wallet lives here and that you need to find him if you want to get back. This is everything i got, please give me feedback i would really appreciate it."
n5hmym,"What do you like to see in a ""walking simulator"" game?","Hello all,\n\nI am relatively accomplished fiction writer who also happens to love playing video games. I have been dabbling around with some game development software for a couple years now just learning the basics and I think I am ready to start work on my own narrative-driven adventure game; aka a ""walking simulator."" Think ""Firewatch,"" ""The Stanley Parable,"" and ""Gone Home.""\n\nI am choosing to make a walking simulator because my strength is in story-telling. I have no interest in developing a classically ""challenging"" experience with complex combat and the like; in my opinion we already have plenty of games which accomplish that better than I could ever hope to. What I want is to tell a story and transport the player on a journey. \n\nI realize some of you probably just don't appreciate walking simulators and that's cool, I get it. There's plenty of genres of games which I don't like or enjoy. But for those of you who do enjoy walking simulators, what are some things that your favorites do that made you love them?"

However, the river was then contaminated by deadly nuclear radiation and then thousands of people were killed by radiation. Upon investigating the incident it was discovered that there was an US listening device which was powered by nuclear energy hidden above the mountains of Nanda Devi, just 600 meters away from the Ganges River. This so called ""listening device"" was a device that can pìck up radio and nuclear transmissions from China. The US wanted to install such a device in a discreet location which is why the Himalayas is where the CIA wanted to place the nuclear listening device in the peaks of Nanda Devi.\n\nCalled ""Operation Hat"" in 1964. Fourteen US mountain climbers along with four sherpas, were tasked by their governments to install the nuclear listening device above Nanda Devi. However, before they could make it into the top a giant avalanche had struck the team and were killed, and the nuclear device lost.\n\nThe poisoning of the Ganges river, which was caused by the lost nuclear device had caused outrage amongst the Indian people and it demanded the US to come and fix the problem. The US agreed and sent one of the world's best climbers to go to Nanda Devi, search the nuclear listening device and disable it for good.\n\nBut at the mountains of Nanda Devi, there are horrors that have surfaced underneath the snow. The souls of the abandoned rise as monsters, deformed by nuclear radiation and ice."
n5advd,Ghost Hunters: Basically Ace Attorney Investigations meets Gravity Falls and Scooby Doo.,"**Was digging through old files in my Google Drive when I stumbled upon this old halloween themed mystery game concept I had a few years back. Was originally going to make this an RPG Maker game myself, but never got around to it and kinda lost interest in the idea. I also included the only cases I actually had concepts for.**\n\nEx-detective Rook Key, with nobody else to go to for a job, is forced to join his brother, Spook Key, and his ghost hunting team in solving mysteries. He is reluctant to go, but when he finds out himself that ghosts and monsters aren’t just a myth or legend, he also finds out there was more to a certain case than meets the eye, can he solve what had happened in his final unsolved case, or will he just find himself 6 feet under?\n\nMain Characters: \n\nRook Key: The player character of this story. As the 20 year old newcomer to the Ghost Hunters team, he was a former detective for the police a few months prior to the start of the game, lost his job after he went rogue during a police chase after he thought he saw a dark figure staring at him with a coat barring a symbol from the card of two of his cases. He then abandoned his chase to go after him, letting the crook get away. He has great investigative and interrogation abilities. His personality is that of a logical genius who is pretty down to earth and enjoys puzzles and games that encourage strategy or deduction. He is a very easy scare for any supernatural being, but won’t be scared as easily if it’s something more realistic. Carries a notebook or notepad to take notes on any new information like testimony or evidence.\n\nSpook Key: Rook’s 19 year old brother who invited his brother Rook onto his team of Ghost Hunters. A chill kind of person who doesn’t get scared easily and talks to ghosts and monsters like they’re normal people and part of everyday life. Enjoys seeing and experiencing the supernatural. Apparently had a job at a pizza joint over a little over a year prior to the game’s events, but got fired for abandoning his order when he claims saw a ghost flying by and chased after it instead of making the delivery, making the order over an hour late. After that, he formed the Ghost Hunters with the customer’s son, and his soon to be best friend, team in a moment of genius inspired by what he saw. He is a bit dense though and too chill for his own good when he doesn't get freaked out by monsters that might be actively trying to kill them.\n\nSans Fear: An 19 year old boy genius who met and became Spook’s best friend a year prior after he gave him and his parents a pizza an hour late and told them he claimed to see a ghost, which Sans believed him. Has an interest in science and an even bigger interest in studying the paranormal, but his interest reached its peak when he lost his arm and his hair turned an unstainable pale white in a science accident when he miscalculated something, before fainting he could have sworn to see his assistant’s hand glowing and likely using magic to keep him stable, thinking she was possibly a witch as the healing was too advanced for any kind of current technology. He replaced said arm with robotic one that is far stronger than his former arm and comes equipped with multiple tools to help his partners out. Joined the Ghost Hunters after he and Spook first formed it together. Personality wise, a very intelligent person and enjoys challenging Rook’s genius in games and working with him, has knowledge of many supernatural beings from Ghosts to Vampires. He also has a love for technology and believes science can solve almost any problem, with varying results that more often than not backfire on him.\n\nYokari Kaizuka: A 22 year old girl who moved into town 1 year prior to the game’s events from Japan. An ex-police officer who moved after she claimed to see a demon outside her room flying at night, and everyone called her crazy and she got fired. She joined the Ghost Hunters after Sans and Spook overheard her talking about her experience seeing a demon and they are quick to believe her thanks to their own experiences at having scrapes with the supernatural.\n\nGameplay:\n\n-Overworld: Focuses on investigation and exploration, but is often the place for cutscenes. After an investigation, your progress can be saved between each chapter of the cases and from the pause menu on the Overworld.\n\n-Interrogation: Basically an Ace Attorney Cross Examination style of trying to debunk someone’s logic. After hearing their testimony, you can then Press for more information or Present items to object. However Presenting the wrong item will damage you, if you get KO’d. It’s game over. You can also ask certain teammates what they think and they’ll each give you either a random piece of dialogue with a humorous response or some more information or questions of their own that can create an entirely new statement. For reference, think of the Cross Examination from Professor Layton vs Ace Attorney or the Great Ace Attorney games except instead of mutliple witnesses reacting to certain testimony, it's your teammates.\n\n-Logic Match: When a witness refuses to cooperate with you, you enter a Logic Match, which plays out like AAI2’s Logic Chess, minus the time limit and replacing it with the chance to make only 5 mistakes, after that it’s game over. You can either wait things out and listen to the witness or talk to them by pointing things out that they say. Sometimes, you may need another piece of information to open things up. However you can also annoy them with questions and can anger them into accidently slipping something that they’re hiding, giving you more info to work with.\n\nCase Ideas:\n\n-On Rook’s first outing with his new team, he and the others find themselves with 6 other people, one of which is murdered and another one is secretly a vengeful spirit, and all of them are locked in a mansion filled with haunted suits of armor and other ghosts. Now with all 10 of them being suspects, they must figure who is the murderer is before the vengeful spirit gets to them first.\n\n-Inspired by Night Trap, the gang is enlisted by a family to watch over their household for a few hours in a misunderstanding of what their business card where it says, “House Caretakers,” because of Spook's incredibly poor penmanship when he commissioned the cards.\n\nSo they’re hired to watch over the house while their daughter has some friends over, Rook has them take the job anyway as it turns out there was a string of disappearances in this household and the police were unable to investigate the household as the owners wouldn’t allow it. So as they watch over the house with their fellow teenagers, unaware the house owners are actually monsters themselves with possibly malicious plans for the gang, all while Rook uses this opportunity to solve this case once and for all.\n\n-Rook wakes up in a hospital bed and finds his friends are all curious about why Rook fainted after seeing a card with a symbol on it at the end of the case before this one. Reluctantly he tells them a story of.\n\nIt then cuts to Rook’s first case, where he finds himself investigating a murder trying finding the true criminal, and he finds at the scene of the crime a note revealing the same symbol seen at the end of the previous case before it then shows him investigating a case connected to it, where, while chasing the culprit who fled after proving them to be the murderer and finding another card, he sees a man in the shadows with the symbol on his coat who was walking away leading to him going rouge to chase that man instead, leading to him being fired.\n\nHe then finished his story as it cuts back to the present where he explains what happened to him after that leading up to when he joined the Ghost Hunters."
n52uek,Rougelike + Survival Game idea,"I want to get some feedback/suggestions on the general idea for a game I have.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere's basically a hub that the player uses as a base. So crafting, upgrading, storing loot and all would be there. To get the items they would go out into generated areas as a selected class. Killing enemies, getting loot/resources, and even facing zone/area bosses.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNo permadeath, unless the player wanted it. There would be a death penalty, I just don't know what it would be yet. Maybe lost of some stuff, or hit to level/stats for a period of time. Figured a general level for the player and maybe a class level for the different classes."
n50yq6,Looking for Opinions - Among Us but with a Time Loop Twist," \n\nI'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I've got a pretty original idea for a game and I'm looking for opinions before fully committing to it.\n\nThe main idea is "" **Among Us but in a Time Loop** "".\n\nJust to be clear, me and my team want to develop this idea ourselves, we just need to establish if it's worth the time or not. \n\nBasically, it's a 2D top-down social deduction game (like Among Us) about a group of thieves that infiltrate a fancy penthouse. Among them there is a killer that needs to sabotage the operation by killing them all. The thieves get meeting were they can choose to vote out a player. They win by either voting out the killer or completing all their tasks.\n\nThe game's **core mechanic** however, is the presence of a time loop. **Every X minutes, if neither side won, the loop starts over.**\n\nNot all progress is lost though. The players can see **time glitches**, 'ghosts' of dead players from previous loops, giving them information about their paths based on which they can deduce who the killer is (i.e. if a player dies, in the next loop everyone still alive will be able to see a replay of their movement / pathing, in real time).\n\nAs the thieves grow their chances of success with every loop, the killer does too. Every action the killer does, including causing emergencies, cutting off the power, locking doors, will be repeated at the exact same moment in every upcoming loop, establishing a pattern the players will need to learn in order to maximize their chance of survival.\n\nSo think of any game or movie based on a time loop (Groundhog Day, Deathloop, etc.) and imagine it's concept adapted to fit a social deduction / Among Us type of game."
n4zz50,Lots of ideas here is one for now,Killer Conscience - the basic ideas is a classic killer victim situation where you start the game of getting set up to see the killer but before anything happens you cut away only to go through said killers life making choices living it seeing what made them a killer but you must choose carefully cause each choice will decide the kind of killer you will be let me know what you think and tell me if you want to hear anymore ideas cause I have a lot more complicated ones both on mechanics and story I love a great balance of both with some awesome twist I am planning on starting my own video games design company so any feedback helps

What I mean is, I am currently developing a VR Horror game that has one central monster and maybe 3 underlings. It also takes place in only one setting, inside and outside a building with many rooms inside. My question is, for this setting and type of game, how should the main baddie work?

But I want to know what others think, and what other ideas of good enemy AI other people had. Any input is welcome!"
n4wrgw,"Psychic Shells - A team multiplayer shooter with dozens of AI-controlled teammates you can ""dive into"" after dying.","Games start with dozens of AI soldiers (let's call them ""shells"") already fighting on the ground, and players get to ""dive into"" any of them at any time. When you die, you're forced to dive into any other shell on your team to continue. The AI-controlled shells aren't nearly as good as actual players, but they help.\n****\nWhenever a shell dies (either player or AI controlled) they're downed for a few seconds and then get back up... to fight for the other team. Killing a shell makes them switch team. **Whichever team converts all the shells to their side wins.**\n\nThis means that when one team is about to win, the losing team will not have enough shells for all of their players, so some will be forced to spectate unless they can gain back some shells. There might even be clutches where one team rallied back from having only one player left."
n4vydg,Pokemon but as a Survival Tactical Squad Turn-Based RPG instead of a linear strategy RPG,"&gt;Op, you mean kinda like ""[Pokemon Mystery Dungeon](https://nerdmacia.cl/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Pokemon-Mystery-Dungeon-Rescue-Team-DX-13.jpg)"" or more like ""[Pokemon Conquest](https://www.maniac.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/conquest-oben.jpg)""\n\nYeah, kinda like both (but more like conquest because mistery dungeon is more roguelike based) maybe like a mix of both? (debatible) but without being in the Edo era or somthing, and without using generals or conquering stuff, and of course changing and adding some other stuff.  \n\n\n&gt;Op, why you want to add the survival genere to pokemon?\n\nBecause, a lot of people tend to forget that the ""Pokemon World"" can be Hardcore and METAL as fuck.  \n\n\n&gt;What do you mean? Pokemon is the most child friendly franchise of nintendo.\n\n[\*Laughs in official pokemon manga crudeness and matureness\*](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/001/181/205/3ad.png)\n\n[\*Laughts again a little bit more\*](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/pokemon/images/7/74/R%26S083_8.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/715?cb=20150911111238)\n\n[\*smiles at you like a champion\*](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/13/c9/1f/13c91f4e527d64ee3ffb1e8dd09c4812.jpg)\n\nWhy do you think that every professor tells you that is dangerous to go on tall grass without a ~~bodyguard/decoy~~ pokemon?

You are the most important piece on the board. if you're killed in battle because your pokemon didnt protect you, there's no point to continue the battle.\n\nWith the tactical mechanics you can easily be put into the pokemon battles and it can be added nice features to the battles like move in the terrain to dodge attacks, cover, obtain a terrain advantage, set traps, Aid your fallen pokemons etc.  \n\n\n&gt;So, op, tell us, this idea of yours requires ""HIGH QUALITTY ANIMATIONS AND 3D MODELS"" like the new core games? or games like Fire Emblem: Three Houses\n\n# No.\n\nEven if i LOVE the [looks of FE: Three Houses](https://i.imgur.com/5kaShAp.jpg); for my idea i preffer a more simplistic aproach. \n\nA 2D simple board for ""combat phase"", very much like [R-Day Combat board](https://img.apkcafe.es/img:bz1mMmJhMGEmbD0xZzE3Jmg9anBnJmY9Z2xtJmk9NDc). \n\nEasy to code, Easy to see and understand what surrounds your character, easy to fix bugs. No need to know 3d programing and super dificult stuff so it will be faster to develop, less demand to the processor, and... more time to put more enphasis in story.\n\n***Routes and grinding places*** will become gigantic boards that you have to cross and in order to arrive from one city/town to another. Pokemon will spawn randomly at random places in the board. but only 6 enemies at time. (battles will be a max of 6v6 pokemon + you)\n\nFor ***overwold and peaceful places*** would be like [normal overworld from gen 1-5 main series](https://i.imgur.com/yInfCIZ.png). and your team gets ""invisible and not playable at moment""\n\n&gt;Ok OP, you said you want to change and add some other stuff. What do you have in mind?\n\nWell... your character is NOT superman nor he has a dimentional pocket inside his bag, so the amount of items you can carry will be limited AND a static base will be implemented. \n\nA lor of changes would be made to a lot of pokemon logic"

Also supports cross-play and cross-progression.\n\nRating: UK - 7, US - E10+ (Mild Language, Mild Violence), AUS - PG\n\nThis idea is an open-world racing game taking place in the fictional Motorama Festival. It will also be a spiritual reboot of the Forza Horizon franchise.\n\n***WORLD MAP &amp; FESTIVAL SITES***\n\nThe open-world map ranges from Carburetor County to Los Angeles - Southern California, featuring a variety of iconic landmarks and areas.\n\nCarburetor County features Radiator Springs, Ornament Valley, Willy's Butte, Interstate 40, Cadillac Range Mountains, a dirt arena, a dam, an oil refinery, a satellite array and an aircraft boneyard.\n\nSouthern California with Los Angeles features California Highway 1, Santa Monica, Hollywood, Beverly Hills, Downtown LA, LAX Airport, Port of LA, San Gabriel Mountains, Angeles National Forest, Los Angeles International Speedway, etc.\n\nThere will be **two** festival sites, one in Carburetor County and the other in Los Angeles.\n\n***AVATARS***\n\nYou can create your own human avatar; male or female. You can change their clothing, accessories, and even change the style and color of their hair. You can even make them wear special costumes (Spider-Man, The Mandalorian, Stormtrooper, Captain America, Frozone, Master Chief, etc.).\n\nThey will be voiced, whereas the avatars in the Horizon series didn't speak. Like the Cars characters, they will also react on things that happen around them - winning/losing a race, nailing/failing a PR stunt, crashing, getting rammed, passing a racer or getting passed, etc. (""Alright, let's do this!"", ""Outta my way!"", ""Watch where you're going!"", ""How do you like that?!"") - This would replace the quick chat feature that was seen in Horizon 4.\n\n***GAME INTRO***\n\nThe game's intro will be similar to Forza Horizon 2.

The main protagonist is **your human avatar**, where you start out as a rookie and work your way up to the top to become the Motorama champion. You'll make friends with Lightning McQueen and all his pals along the way, as well as make some rivals like Jackson Storm and Chick Hicks. You need to complete a certain amount of races and challenges, show off your skills and earn enough XP to progress. You'll unlock more events as you go on. Will you become the next speed!?\n* The **secondary** storyline is similar to Forza Horizon 2.

At first my idea was just to experiment with aligning arrows, see if that can be some form of tetris or suduko or match-3 type of game... but I'm feeling kind of lost in the bubble. I'm hoping maybe you can give me a clearer opinion on what's the better direction to take this. Thanks!"
n4oo7f,An idea for a bizzare cute'em up shooter I had,I have a really bizzare idea regarding the plot and features of a shooter game I have been thinking of doing eventually. \n\nThe main characters will be about two elderly furry muscular lesbian angel witch sisters named Maria and Zion who are ten million years old.\n\nThe game would take place on a post apocalyptic earth devoid of humans because of nuclear war and the only creatures left besides them are cute forest critters living in harmony.\n\nThen one day a foreign army of robot invaders lead by an angry french hotdog named Nils seeking to conquer earth to please the intergalactic emperor Gustavus adolphus who was king of Sweden during the 1600s but in his resurrected mecha furry form ready to use the forest critters as tickle slaves and to use them as forced labour for his galactic empire.\n\nThe game will be a cute'em up shooter inspired by Sega's fantasy zone game series in terms of basic gameplay and aesthetics but with differences such as bonus levels were you earn extra angels by destroying floating big Mac hamburgers and Double quarter pounders spewing out mechafurries with jetpacks.\n\nThere will also be permanent secret upgrades and a big emerald obtainable after collecting 10 smaller emeralds in the right colour order on each world and once 7 big emeralds have been collected you unlock 3 more secret levels where you face Gustavus main henchmen before facing the emperor himself. \n\nI have a solid understanding in the fundamentals of programming so that shouldn't really be a major issue as far that is concerned the only thing I am uncertain about is the artwork(I do have a wacom s tablet I can use)but I could always hire somebody to do it for me.
n4lwaj,An Hour of Time - A simple game about looking after yourself,"Hi everyone, I'm Matias.\n\nI'm currently working on a game idea and wanted to know what people thought of it. Well here goes.\n\nYou play as an unnamed character who wakes up at 6:00 in the morning. They have to leave for work at 7:00 meaning they have an extra hour of time. Each task that you do will take up to 15 minutes meaning you can only do 4 tasks. The game is simple and you can do whatever you want really. \n\nWant to drink a beer? go ahead. \n\nMaybe text a friend to hang out during the weekend? You can do that too.\n\n At the end of the four tasks, your character will tell you how happy they feel based on the things you did. I want a cute animation style where the characters face appears in the bottom corner of the screen and text dialogue similar to that of an RPG appear when you interact with something.\n\nMy overall intention is to make a game that encourages people to look after themselves and perhaps fix and enjoy the little things in life when they have the time for them.\n\nWell, that's it. Sorry if you expected something with a bigger scope but I want to have a simple idea which I can make a game about within the timeframe of two months. \n\nPlease, feel free to leave ideas as to the tasks you can do or give advice as to how I should go about making the game."

n4hd2q,Massive Open world dystopian survival game,"Game takes place in America, the game map is composed of the entirety of the U.S. and perhaps Canada or Mexico could be offered in dlcs.\n\nAfter a short war, America has been taken complete control of by China/Russia/Iran/North Korea or whatever other country the U.S. doesn't play nice with in real life.\n\nWhatever country has control of the U.S. is way more technologically advanced and has things such as robot suits, drones, and other sci fi esque weapons \n\nThe player is encouraged to stay out of bigger cities and instead build bases out of sight in the woods, caves, and remote places of America while also maintaining stealth if they absolutely have to enter a town\n\nBigger cities contain more loot but also higher level enemies. Once again, favoring stealth over the guns a'blazing approach is encouraged for looting these bigger cities."
n4co22,FPS/RTS Hybrid,"5 human players per team.  1 player on each team is the ""general"".  He sees the map from top down and controls the game like an RTS with the 4 other players as ""champions"".  Obviously he can't control the players, but he would be able to create, upgrade, and control NPC units.\n\nWhile he wouldn't control the champions, the general could assign them ""missions"" like ""capture this point"" or ""kill these enemies"".  Depending on the mission and the difficulty, the champions would get resources they could use to upgrade themselves so they stay relevant as the fight goes on.  Even if they don't receive any missions, they can still get some resources if they kill enemy units (especially other champions).\n\nI assume general would not be a coveted position, but RTS AI technology is pretty impressive and I believe an AI general could be effective.  The intelligence and skill of both the AI general and the NPCs would be based on the players' ELO.\n\nI think the biggest challenge would be finding a balance between general and champion effectiveness.   It will be difficult to make sure that both roles feel effective and at low levels especially, the generals and the champions might often just play completely separate from each other, defeating the point of the game."

The idea isn't really all that much, but its free to use and can be very basic.\n\nLet me know what y'all think."

n48vhy,[Survey] I have a predev survey for a tabletop rpg/4x strategy game.,"I have a tabletop rpg in development that plays as a 4x strategy game. I started this beast of a project as art therapy, and now all that's left in developing the project is grunt work. While working on it yesterday, I realized that I still don't know my player's expected experience. Without playing it, I don't think I will. Without knowing this piece of data, I can't get the game testable. However I happen to have a testing survey I developed some time ago and a Reddit login. I may post in the wrong subreddit from time to time, which is what happened to me last night: but I believe a conclusion to my problem is possible.\n\nI need to know what you as players will try to do in a 'build a collaboration' structured environment. I will want feedback from lone wolves and collaborators, as well as who you are from any dynamic you might fit into.\n\nI need to see what you as a player would expect to be doing. I hope you'll help.\n\n#Game description starts here.\n\nI am building an RPG that awards the player with power util when capital util and experience points would be awarded, simulating getting people to do things for you for the sake of fame. I use grinding mechanics to make creating plans into systems of numbers. The NPCs are structured to be containers for influence biases and wants, and they are influenced by their institutions. It's a game which recommends a folder for every player's sheet dossier.\n\nYou and your team are collaborators in an institutional startup. \n\nSystems I have developed: There is a system I have for emulating telnet muds and exploring a city, although it needs more formality in separating the command type explore from the command type travel. I already have an untested npc randomness generation dice ai I don't have much confidence in, but I think my fundamentals are sound. I have an auction system that allows all players at the table to impact anything about the game and, frankly: troll the other players; and the auction requires investigation. The NPC is being programmed to insist on scheduling their meetings ahead of time, although I only have that drafted as a snippit; and if all players aren't involved, I'm going back to RPG roots of story games with the auction system, and so every player gains an opportunity at interaction. I even think the system fairly allows one player to make a different choice for another active player.\n\nThere are systems for social interaction by structuring an NPCs ready biases, and systems for detective gaming resolution to quests. There are rules for staging the outcomes of social occasions. There are needs for systems, but the beginnings of such systems, for a give/take relationship with an institutional body of public. There is a mentor NPC in the character of the dangerous secretary; or the fixer. Players auction for the purpose of their institution together, with 3 spaces open to create a complete picture. There is a combat system (the danger mode) with XCom severity and permadeath to keep a hand on combat as game designer; and hopefully by release date I'll have the natural disasters figured out as well, since the explosions already support a physics system.\n\nWith a game with 50+ sheets of development docs, the above is what comes to mind immediately.\n\n#Survey starts here.\n\nDo you see somewhere in the description that you would need to learn before you could grow within?\n\nIn theater of the mind, were you able to pick up what was going on?\n\nIn theater of the mind, were you able to get started alright?\n\nIn theater of the mind,  were you able to come up with solutions using the options provided to you?\n\nIn theater of the mind,  did you feel like the game mechanics would support your ideas?\n\nIn theater of the mind,  did you feel like the game suggested enough options to inspire you to your ideas?\n\n[Starting here, I'm leaving out the 'In theater of the mind.']\n\n...Did you feel like the preparation mechanics were assistive to your play?\n\n...Did the game help you feel like you could anticipate your limits?\n\n...Did you feel like the threats you encountered in the game were surmountable?\n\n...Did you feel like you had enough options to handle the threats you encountered in the game?\n\n...Did you see the threats coming?\n\n...Did the preparation mechanics provided to you assist you in acting on the threats you encountered?\n\n...Did the game provide you with enough prompting to be inspired to find new answers during play?\n\n...Did the preparation mechanics provided to you assist you in finding new answers during play?\n\n...Did the game provide you with enough options to be able to exploit options during play?\n\n...Did you feel like your player character had become a public legend in the assistive mechanics of the celebrity system?"

n480qm,Cursed Realty,"**Genre:**  Comedy, puzzle\n\n**TL;DR:** You are a realtor trying to sell obviously haunted houses to oblivious young couples.\n\n**Graphics:**  I'm imagining simple, pixelated graphics, but I could see a 3D version using basic Unity assets working, too.\n\n**Gameplay:**  Each ""level"" is a different house tour.  You beat a level by selling a house.  Each successive house is more haunted than the last.  Your score is based on how much you sell the house for.\n\nLevels start off with you arriving at the house with a short amount of time to clean up messes such as cobwebs, spirit writings, and objects thrown by poltergeists.  Some of these ""messes"" are too extreme, so you might disguise them as something else (eg covering an alter for ritual sacrifice with a table cloth and flowers and calling it a dinner table, or adding to the spirit writings and calling it a graffiti inspired art room).  If you have enough time, you may also set up ""distraction pieces"" such as interesting furniture or fixtures.\n\nOnce the couple arrives, you lead them through calling attention away from any messes you weren't able to clean up.  As time goes on, specters will randomly cause disturbances (throwing objects, rattling chains, causing black liquid to ooze out of drains, etc).  You can distract from disturbing sites by changing your position in the room or pointing out your distraction pieces so the couple turns away and you can distract from noises by playing music or something.  The crazier the spooky event, the crazier your antics to hide it.\n\nYou can leave a couple alone in a room either on the pretext of going to fetch something (refreshments, paint swatches, etc) or allowing them to explore on their own which will allow you a short amount of time to deal with a particularly bad bit of possession in another part of the house.  However, you can't distract the couple while you're away and the price of the house goes up the longer you talk to them so it's a good idea to stay with them.\n\nEach time the couple notices a mess, they will complain about it which will lower the houses overall cost, but also temporarily distract them from the antics of poltergeists so in more difficult stages, it may be advantageous to leave some mess.\n\nAfter a set amount of time, if the couple is not scared off and the price of the house does not reach $0, the couple will declare their intention to buy.  You can still increase the price by talking to them more (at the risk of spectral sabotage), but in general, you would return them to the front porch and have them sign a contract, ending the level."

n3wx70,Teacher RPG,"So before I start I want To say I would develop this game myself if I could, but I can't make good enough art. Im only a programmer.\n\nSo my idea is an RPG where you play as a Teacher in a School for Knights.\n\nAt the beginning of the School year you would meet all of your students ( I was thinking about 20 students each with a personality of their own)\n\nYour job as the teacher is To teach your students in choosen topics, give them assignments and train with them.\n\nEach of these activities will alter the stats and skills of your students.\n\nThe thing is you have limited actions per day (Calendar system a little like Persona)\n\nAfter the School year is done your students graduate and you enter a second phase of the game, This time you're not the teacher you control students all of them.\n\nIn phase 2 (War) the students dont get as much experience you're stuck with the choices you made in phase 1. It's a turn by turn battle system where all 20 of your students are working togheter against ennemies using the skills they learned in phase 1.\n\nNote that at first battles Will be easy, not because ennemies are stronger, but because you have 20 units, but if any of them dies they're dead forever. \n\nIt's important the game forces you To lose characters at some points, it should be impossible To get To the final boss with all 20 characters. \n\n(Oh yea plot twist the final boss is the Teacher you played in phase 1)\n\nSome inspiration from :\n- Fire Emblem Three Houses. \n- Persona Series\n- Classic RPGs"
n3vtwn,Idea for a future game,"Some sort of futuristic multiplayer Bounty-hunter simulator in an open-world. You can either become the hunter or the hunted and have to outsmart the other player by setting up traps, installing cameras or tracking the hunted one. Some aspects of the game could be a trackable mobile phone (makes it possible to order stuff but the hunter knows your location), or distraction. The objection of the hunter is to find and knockout the other one, the objective of the hunter is surviving until the bounty-hunter gives up, dies or doesn't find the suspect within 24 in-game-hours.\nRight now i have some experience in making games but in the beginning its too much work for just one person. So if you're interested in the idea, feel free to text me."
n3uy1b,Fallout 1/2 with plot," I want to create a Fallout-style game with bookish, tooth-breaking plot, where you investigate pre-war events by collecting notes, maps, items and so on. Like Fallout:Equestria (which is a book).\n\nThe gameplay is going to be ""read a note, hack into a terminal, talk to strangers, think, THINK MORE, and figure out what happened in the past and what do you need to do"". So it is kind of a puzzle too. Maybe with some fights in between. Maybe with stealth. Maybe I even can let the player freely talk to characters.\n\nWhat I have is coding skills. What I need is a good and interesting pre-war story, or a fiction writer, who can create one (I am little bit fiction writer myself, but I lack creativity). I'm sure there are tons of ficwriters who want someone to come and say ""hey, I'm gonna make a movie/game out of your fanfic"". So it may be your lucky day!\n\n**Spoilers ahead**. &gt;!Rough pre-war history would look like this: alternative world, country A fight against country B for some territory rich with oil. But everything is not that simple. Some corporations in A benefit from the war. Government benefits as well (hello, 1984). Clearly there are spies and fifth column. Some people even want the apocalypse to happen. Monstrous projects are developed (FEV, power armor, mechas, why not?), and one of these projects is a time machine, capable of receiving one short message from the future. And then bombs fell, everyone died. The main hero investigates pre-war secrets, finds the time machine and sends a message to the past (which can be ""surrender"", ""attack"", or some really special message that will stop the war and make everyone happy). But of course I want to add PLOT and DRAMA, and TWISTS, and I really need your help for that.!&lt;"
n3rdei,Hey! I want to start developing a game. How do you like this idea?,"  \n\nGood day everyone!\n\nI want to share with you an idea for the game. Perhaps someone will decide to take it into development. So far, these are just my thoughts, set out on paper.\n\nI have always liked the way children look at the world - they are not afraid to fantasize. When I was a child, I imagined myself as a hero in different worlds with obstacles and dangers. Now I want to develop a game about children's fantasy, in which there is no room for the impossible.\n\nI would be glad to receive your feedback and wishes!\n\nConcept\n\nA game about a little girl. She and her dad move to a country house. Her mother died of an incurable disease; her father grieves for his wife and does not know how to raise her daughter. The girl is all alone. Having closed herself off from psychological problems that are difficult for a child, she does not want to be friends with local children at all. Instead, she comes up with a world of her own. In her fantasies, she is free to do whatever she wants. She has friends - old toys that come to life in her thoughts (or really?). Gradually, the player no longer understands what reality is and what fiction is. In addition to beautiful fantasy creatures and beautiful locations, the girl's inner fears appear. They are destroying the beautiful world, making toys ordinary. If fears win, then the beautiful world will be destroyed, and the girl will go mad. Our goal is to overcome the fears of loss and loneliness in ourselves and help the girl to live a normal life.\n\nGame theme\n\nChildren perceive the world in a completely different way. They are in this life quite recently, therefore, they do not know much or do not understand much, but they can fantasize up to what they still do not know. Fantasies help fight real problems.\n\nHero\n\nLittle girl. 5 years. She has no name so as not to limit the fantasy of the player.\n\nShe can hover, talk to animals, manipulate her toys, and fix old broken toys.\n\nShe cannot control her fears.\n\nSetting\n\nThe game has four locations: a tree house, a forest, an old barn and a house.\n\nThe girl imagines the tree house as her castle; her subjects live in it - toys.\n\nIt changes; secret rooms and halls appear in it.\n\nThe forest is very changeable. It has many animals to talk to. Trails get confused and change direction. There are labyrinths and rabbit holes.\n\nThe old barn is dark and scary. It contains many broken toys that you can repair and attach to your retinue. However, in order to do this, it is necessary to defeat the fear of the dark.\n\nThe house is ordinary without fancy elements. He brings the girl back to reality. Through the surrounding objects, you can learn the story of the girl. There are also many useful items in the house.\n\nFears - dark formless entities - can appear at any moment. They destroy the world around them. They can be fought with toys. They are the girl's main protection. Each toy has its own abilities.\n\nReferences\n\nGames:\n\n1) Alice: Madness Retur\n\n2) The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit\n\n3) Little Nightmares\n\nFilms:\n\n1) A Monster Calls\n\n2) The Spiderwick Chronicles"
n3pjq9,The gods game: part 1: the gameplay,"&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo in my last post i slightly touched on gameplay (Yea i know this post is designated one but i'm annoying and started at zero) but i didn't really go that in depth but what i did say is that it would be a capture the point 5v5 game with parts of both platform fighters and mobas and this still mostly stands. You see I realized that having 5 players per team might be too much to keep up with in large team fights so I'm lowering it down to 4 per team. But another important thing is the objectives. What are you supposed to do? Well there are four different objectives with one end goal let me explain. Objective one is to capture the three points scattered around the map. Your entire team gets gold for every teammate inside a point no matter if they are there alone or with an enemy and if your team is able to spend 15 seconds alone without enemies inside one of the points the point itself will start to generate gold for your team, no matter if a teammate is in it or not.\n\nObjective two is to get stronger and eliminate enemies. With gold you will be able to upgrade yourself and get things like more health, damage or stronger abilities (more on that in a later post) and this is good when you are in a fight with an enemy. You want to eliminate enemies because then they will need to respawn which will give your team time to finish other objectives. You also get gold for your troubles and a lite gold if you only helped.\n\nNow comes the last objective, hunting. Every now and again after the game has passed the 5 minute mark 2 minute timers will appear one the different points. When these timers reach 0 a boss will be spawned and that point will not be able to generate any gold for either one of the teams until it is defeated. When defeated the boss will give the team that killed it a lot of gold each and give the point it's currently stationed at and make the enemies unable to get gold or capture that points for 5 minutes. And lastly there's the goal. The goal of the game is to get strong enough to be able to destroy the other teams spawn which is located really fearfully on their side of the map. however it will be protected by 3 turret crystals which will shoot and kill enemies within range. two of the three turret crystals need to be destroyed to be able to damage the enemy spawner. And once the enemy spawner is destroyed you win.\n\nI was hoping to be able to talk more about the map but I'll need to do that later since this post is getting long. So i'll hopefully see you then, bye!"
n3mz2o,Features for a console turn based rpg,"I’m currently developing a turn based rpg that plays in the command window. At the moment I have fully functional combat and decent UI, looking for ideas for features broad or specific just for some inspiration 🙂"
n3lnfm,Role-playing as Blacksmith/Herbalist/Alchemist/etc (crafting based in open world),"What if you could play as the shop-keepers in RPGs? But in a way that is dangerous and exciting.\n\nThe setting is medieval. \n\nYou craft various things depending on your role, in an immersive way. The three roles are Herbalist/Alchemist/Blacksmith. You choose one.\n\nGameplay evolves scavenging the open world for materials depending on your chosen role (taking samples/picking herbs, buying supplies). This is dangerous because you might get ambushed by bandits and lose your stock on the way back.\n\nIf you make it back, then you combine ingredients or use craftsmanship in a workshop simulator (for example blacksmithing) and going through the various steps to craft a good. This can be a medicinal brew, poison or elixir, or sword/axe.\n\nWhen done, you fullfill orders at your market stall/shop. Danger lurks even in this environment, you cannot trust every person that comes up to you to buy your goods. Simple combat mechanics are involved in fending off thieves, rivals, etc. \n\nIf you lose these fights you either lose gold (get robbed) or your equipment gets broken (requiring you to close shop for a period of time while you fix things which costs money).\n\nWhen successful at filling an order, you get a sum of gold and reputations points (more on that later). Hopefully this sum balances out any prior loses.\n\nYou can use the gold to upgrade your workshop. You can use it to spend on rare ingredients. (unlocking more craftable goods)\n\nIf you're wealthy enough you can hire an apprentice. They cost daily upkeep money but will fetch ingredients for you and act as an extra-hand (cutting crafting wait times). \n\nThe end goal is to get the other herbalists/blacksmiths/alchemists on the map to go out of business because npc's choose your shop as the best in the land. \n\nThis is based on your reputation rank, which goes up with each successful order, or down when you close shop to fix equipment. \n\nYou've successfully completed the role when you reach Reputation Rank 100. You can .continue to take orders or start over with a different role\n\n\-----------\n\nThats all so far. What do you guys think? Is it realistic as a game concept?"
n3jgew,"A ""true sequel"" to vib ribbon","It seems like vib ribbon isn't looking forward to any more major new games only re-releases... I would conjure up a new game called ""Zepto Ribbon"" which is a fan game to continue the series. [Check out vib ribbon it's a great ps1 game] Maybe add more support improve AI for custom tracks, remap old songs [if you can actually use them], add new to trippy visuals to make it more difficult, add a points system that scales with the pattern combos, visuals, and speed. Would be a massive big fat copyright fiasco but just a idea.\nP.S : feel free to have a heyday with my idea"
n3ihd9,Monster collecting horror game,As the title implies i think monster collection + the horror genre can work well together. Like the player themselves can be powerless and they have to rely on the monsters they collect to protect them. The player might have to run and hide while their monsters fight the ones hunting you down. \n\nAdd in unique power interactions between the monsters so some can slip pass yours if they don't have the power to stop them and vise versa. Also add permadeath to your monsters so if you ever run out of monsters to protect you it can result in a nearly hopeless situation that i don't think a lot of horror games can portray very well.\n\nHell even taming can be a heart pounding experience because the player might not ever know if the monster they are trying to coax will decide to eat them instead. Just a idea that hasn't been done and think it would make for a entertaining mechanic to have in a horror game.
n3glla,"Hey guys, complete novice here, I'm starting my own Open World 3D MMO with advanced AI built on the blockchain","To all you newbies out there, welcome! \n\nIf you have a goal of creating, finishing and publishing a game, then learn this bit of information first:  \n\nSTART SMALL DAMMIT! \n\nI know you really want to make your own RPG. I know you spent all that time naming the weapons and factions and coming up with all the backstory and the multiple endings, but guess what? You're not going to be able to make it. \n\nThink of a game similar to your game idea. Was it made by hundreds of experienced professionals paid by millions of dollars of budget over the course of years? \n\nYes? Then it's time to think about why you think you can do what those hundreds of people took years to do. \n\nThe only limitations on your idea are your imagination, which is great, it's great fun to come up with innovative and expansive ideas. \n\nBut when it comes to actually manifesting your idea, then there are quite a few limitations. There are limitations on how ""big"" of a game one person or a small team can make. There are even more limitations when that person or small team are amateurs. \n\nI know this message is just pissing in the wind of the neverending waves of new and naive developers, but if this can save any of you some time then it's worth it in my book. \n\n**If you're just trying to mess around and learn, then by all means start putting the pieces together for your dream MMO.** It doesn't matter if you don't finish it or even get far if you're just trying to have fun or learn something new. \n\nBut, if you want to finish a project and see it published, start REALLY small and I *promise* it will take longer and require more work than you expected. But you'll feel all the more proud when it's done. \n\nCheers!"
n3fohd,Immersion in game development.,"As I always say, immersion goes far beyond graphics. Having the best graphics does not mean having immersion. The immersion that I speak is like entering a castle of terror, because it brings you emotions, good or bad. It is immersion that holds the player in the game. It's like not wanting to go out to eat, or do anything else, you just forget you're playing a game. Everything is connected in the setting and theme. If this set of quality adds to the multiple challenges proposed in the game, you already have a big difference, just look at the number of games that are repetitive. Things that take us out of the reality of everyday life, are more likely to cause us emotions.\n\nImmersion is emotion. As I always say, if the game doesn't bring you emotions, for me it's not a good game. This is noticeable in the first 5 minutes of the game. If you are developing a game, take this test, film the friends or relatives who are going to play your game first. Study their reaction. See if your game is being very specific for a single niche of people, if that happens, sometimes it is better to dose your theme a little so that the game is not so restricted. This does not mean that you will lose the essence of your game, just that you will add elements that will attract a larger audience and generate more elements to complement your game immersion. Never forget to attract people by immersion, using art and challenges as the main elements of your game."
n3cf3q,A modern military shooter that is essentially a MOBA,I was thinking it would be fun to play a game like battlefield but you can only play in vehicles. All the infantry would be controlled by AI. \n\nThe players would have to use the various vehicles to guild their infantry units to control points. Those control points could have defensive measures that would need to be disabled before moving on to the next control point and eventually the enemy main base. As the match goes on upgrades will unlock to customize your vehicle.

n3b6p5,[Survey]I have a tabletop rpg in development that plays as a 4x strategy game.,"I have a tabletop rpg in development that plays as a 4x strategy game. I started this beast of a project as art therapy, and now all that's left in developing the project is grunt work. While working on it yesterday, I realized that I still don't know my player's expected experience. Without playing it, I don't think I will. Without knowing this piece of data, I can't get the game testable. However I happen to have a testing survey I developed some time ago and a Reddit login. I may post in the wrong subreddit from time to time, which is what happened to me last night: but I believe a conclusion to my problem is possible.\n\nI need to know what you as players will try to do in a 'build a collaboration' structured environment. I will want feedback from lone wolves and collaborators, as well as who you are from any dynamic you might fit into.\n\nI need to see what you as a player would expect to be doing. I hope you'll help.\n\n#Game description starts here.\n\nI am building an RPG that awards the player with power util when capital util and experience points would be awarded, simulating getting people to do things for you for the sake of fame. I use grinding mechanics to make creating plans into systems of numbers. The NPCs are structured to be containers for influence biases and wants, and they are influenced by their institutions. It's a game which recommends a folder for every player's sheet dossier.\n\nYou and your team are collaborators in an institutional startup. \n\nSystems I have developed: There is a system I have for emulating telnet muds and exploring a city, although it needs more formality in separating the command type explore from the command type travel. I already have an untested npc randomness generation dice ai I don't have much confidence in, but I think my fundamentals are sound. I have an auction system that allows all players at the table to impact anything about the game and, frankly: troll the other players; and the auction requires investigation. The NPC is being programmed to insist on scheduling their meetings ahead of time, although I only have that drafted as a snippit; and if all players aren't involved, I'm going back to RPG roots of story games with the auction system, and so every player gains an opportunity at interaction. I even think the system fairly allows one player to make a different choice for another active player.\n\nThere are systems for social interaction by structuring an NPCs ready biases, and systems for detective gaming resolution to quests. There are rules for staging the outcomes of social occasions. There are needs for systems, but the beginnings of such systems, for a give/take relationship with an institutional body of public. There is a mentor NPC in the character of the dangerous secretary; or the fixer. Players auction for the purpose of their institution together, with 3 spaces open to create a complete picture. There is a combat system (the danger mode) with XCom severity and permadeath to keep a hand on combat as game designer; and hopefully by release date I'll have the natural disasters figured out as well, since the explosions already support a physics system.\n\nWith a game with 50+ sheets of development docs, the above is what comes to mind immediately.\n\n#Survey starts here.\n\nDo you see somewhere in the description that you would need to learn before you could grow within?\n\nIn theater of the mind, were you able to pick up what was going on?\n\nIn theater of the mind, were you able to get started alright?\n\nIn theater of the mind,  were you able to come up with solutions using the options provided to you?\n\nIn theater of the mind,  did you feel like the game mechanics would support your ideas?\n\nIn theater of the mind,  did you feel like the game suggested enough options to inspire you to your ideas?\n\n[Starting here, I'm leaving out the 'In theater of the mind.']\n\n...Did you feel like the preparation mechanics were assistive to your play?\n\n...Did the game help you feel like you could anticipate your limits?\n\n...Did you feel like the threats you encountered in the game were surmountable?\n\n...Did you feel like you had enough options to handle the threats you encountered in the game?\n\n...Did you see the threats coming?\n\n...Did the preparation mechanics provided to you assist you in acting on the threats you encountered?\n\n...Did the game provide you with enough prompting to be inspired to find new answers during play?\n\n...Did the preparation mechanics provided to you assist you in finding new answers during play?\n\n...Did the game provide you with enough options to be able to exploit options during play?\n\n...Did you feel like your player character had become a public legend in the assistive mechanics of the celebrity system?"

n2zb8o,An alchemy/merchant game with chemistry roots,"You know those games where you kill a ton of monsters and get a ton of useless loot from them that you sell? I have an idea for a game from the perspective of the merchant that's buying all those monster parts for some reason.   \n\n\nYou would be an alchemist who buys monster parts from adventurers and refines them into usable wares to sell. At the very least I think potions would be cool to make, but I can also see your character making runes, weapons,. and armor.   \n\n\nAs for how the potions work, there's a lot of real world chemistry techniques that I think could be used for rough inspiration. I just really like the feeling of processing and making potions (kind of like Thaumcraft.) For example, maybe the monsters drop impure gems and you put them in a pot, dissolve them in a liquid, and then precipitate them out to purify them (based on recrystalization). All of these would obviously be super simplified so that most/all people could learn what to do easily.   \n\n\nI generally want to capture the feeling of creating super pure advanced potions/gear by processing trash loot from adventures. A lot of the mechanics of making said potions would be loosely based on real chemistry techniques like recrystalization, distillation, spectroscopy, etc. These techniques would be super simple and streamlined, and the player would just have to learn ""this process analyzes what you have, this one separates, this one purifies, etc.""   \n\n\nOnce you make these potions, you can sell them to certain adventuring parties for the price of them bringing you better reagents and a little gold. This could add a cool component of making sure they're well equipped for their journey. For example, maybe you see that they're going through an ice area so you make them lots of frost resist potions.   \n\n\nIf ambitious, an armor, rune, and weapon component could be added too but honestly the potion stuff is the important aspect."
n2w6h4,An Educational Game Disguised as a Horror Game. (Looking for a writer.),"Hi everyone, I'm Matias.\n\n Recently through the Twine 2 engine, I've been experimenting with creating game narratives. For my new game, I wanted to create an educational game disguised as a horror game. So here's the premise.\n\nYou play as Matt and since kindergarten, your father has bought you an educational game every year for your birthday. Matt's father, however, has greater expectations each year and the games he gets you become harder and harder.  There are two parts to the game\n\n. The first part is the ability to look around your room and can see how much it has changed as you grow older. You can also communicate with family and friends. I want to set the game up so when Matt gets older his room becomes more monochromatic and the environment becomes more serious. We can also learn more about his personal life through his encounters with his father and his friends.\n\nThe second part is where the horror game aspect comes. My plan is to have the educational game teach the player some lessons and the player must answer correctly in order to progress. (The games end up getting more weirder and difficult the more you progress.)   In the first years the educational game will start off happy and get creepier but as the years go buy the game will start creepy and end even creepier. In short, I want my game to have a  moral on how the stress of kids to improve more and more can slowly cause their life to form into a downward spiral where they dissociate from family, friends and sometimes even reality.\n\nI'm looking for a writer who can help me with the overall plot and perhaps even the gameplay. You don't have to be exceptionally talented or anything like that I just want someone to bounce ideas with. If more than one person tries to message me then I will create a group chat. I would also like to send my progress to the people I'm working with through game files so they can test the game and see what could be improved. A once a week message conversation will work fine. Please note anyone under 18 cannot message me to contribute ideas to the game as I'm 18 myself.\n\n I'll look forward to seeing if anyone wants to join otherwise feel free to give criticism/advice in the comments."

nbn84e,Mayday: Air Crash Investigation sim for PC,"I don't think more than maybe 2 or 3 people would actually buy and play this, but I think it would be really cool, so I'll go ahead and post it here.\n\n\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe game opens with the classic ""Mayday"" TV show intro, then you are taken to a screen where it will ask you how much you know about aircraft and aviation terminology in general. This is similar to how FIFA games for example, will ask you how much you know about soccer. Depending on what you answer, the terminology used will be ""dumbed down"" for the player to be able to understand it. The setting can be changed anytime. You will see the main menu where you can start a new game, and will later have the option to view your hangar of collected aircraft models (obtained for each successful investigation) as well as options to review all previous case files and play bonus levels that will unlock once you have a certain amount of XP.\n\n \n\nPOV: You’re a rookie investigator for the NTSB, the US federal agency responsible for investigating the causes of air crashes not only in the states, but all over the world. Your first case is fairly straightforward: a small aircraft that has suffered a clear, catastrophic mechanical failure. This level will serve as a tutorial of sorts. Your team will give you tips on sifting through evidence, identifying different types of mechanical faults, interviewing witnesses, reviewing Cockpit Voice Recorders and Flight Data Recorders, and finally submitting your report to the agency. You can always replay this level if you need to get brushed up on the basics. \n\n\- Become a world-renowned air crash investigator. When you start a new game, your reputation points (or XP) will be low and you’ll only be handling regional cases. The more investigations you successfully complete, the higher it will go, and the more opportunities you’ll have to graduate to more challenging cases all across the globe. \n\n\- Learn to use all the tools of your trade in this free roaming world, from the most advanced technology to good old fashioned gumshoe detective work. Interview witnesses and survivors to see if they can reveal anything that you might be missing. Listen to cockpit conversations as many times as you need to. Sometimes they may hold the answer, sometimes not, but it never hurts to be thorough. Review flight data information to see if any critical systems have failed. Review charts of the surrounding area to see if terrain or weather was a factor. Develop profiles of the captain and crew to determine if human error played a role.  \n\n\- Build a reliable team. Getting to the bottom of an air disaster is an arduous process, so let your team help you with several specific tasks such as poring through debris, conducting media interviews to keep the press off your back, and checking into the background of the crew and passengers. You’ll need to develop sufficient XP to be able to to hire the best of the best. \n\n\- Learn when to call the FBI for assistance. Sometimes, an accident is actually not an accident at all, but a terrorist attack or a disgruntled passenger / employee lashing out. If this is the case, you will be handing control of the final report over to the FBI, and provide a consulting role to help them determine what exactly happened. This is critical to get right the first time, make sure you have all the facts you need before making the call. Misidentifying a case could cause grave damage to your reputation and public confidence in the aviation industry. \n\n\- Bonus levels: investigate cases in historical scenarios, involving several classic aircraft from the 1930s, 40s, 50s, 60s etc. \n\n\- Additional bonus: port all of the unlocked aircraft in your hangar into any flight simulator game.\n\n\- The NTSB and the public are counting on you to deliver an accurate, detailed report that will help further the safety of the aviation industry at large. Follow up on all your leads before submitting your findings."
nbmz6y,Going to start a new project soon...,"I am going to start a new project soon, but I need some ideas. Does anyone have any good game ideas I can use? (credit will be given) It is going to be an RPG, that is all that i can currently confirm since I do not know what the main core of the game will be about."
nblzgw,"Hi, there. Working on a dark fantasy/horror themed grim sci-fi fighting game but need help with the character influences","I want to make sure that these don't sound offensive due to their designs and inspirations. I'm not concerned about the gameplay archetypes at the moment, my concern is the character's physical attributes and if they sound like bad stereotypes.\n\nOne is an ancient Chinese Terracotta soldier statue that controls sand and would play as a trap/zoner.\n\nOne is a female Amazonian tribal vampire, who's focus is on being a rushdown, with a very aggressive play-style.\n\nAnother one is a frost giant that uses the element of ice, who's focus is on being a brute/trapper.\n\nAnd a South Korean spec ops/commando woman with a cybernetic robot dog, which is a puppet playstyle character.\n\nAny feedback, I will gladly appreciate."

nbj3fv,My Game Idea. (Help Needed),"I'm building a game, a rather large one. This will have 4 zones as such. \n\nCampaign (Season based)\n\n \- The initial campaign will be about an alien invasion.\n\nMultiplayer (Season based)\n\n \- Standard game multiplayer, with awesome fast paced game modes\n\nZombies \n\n \- Funny comical zombies that work together to kill the player.\n\nBattle Royale\n\n \- Zone based, instead of a storm circle, this map will be made up of Geo Domes, when a timer runs out, 1 of the GeoDomes will drop, forcing the players to move to the next dome, or die.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am needing help putting this game together, as I am just a single programmer. I'm needing some help putting this game together and thought this would be the best place to ask. Anyone interested please message me and I'll give you a more detailed run down, share the Drive folder and we can start talking over more details.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRoles needed:\n\n   \- 3D Modeller (Preferably with knowledge of Rigging and Animation) however beggars cant be choosers.\n\n  \- Marketers ( This game will have paid content, however the money will go the the builder) \n\n  \- Ideas etc.. I will welcome anyone to jump on this game. Drop me a message and I'll add you to the group"
nbe51r,A platformer rpg but you level DOWN,"So you start the game with simple platforming and level 1 Enemies\nYou start at a very high level, for example 50.\nYou kill everything in 1 hit have tons of hp etc.\nHowever you still get xp when you kill enemies, you will get a small amount at the start but after not too long you'll start leveling down . When you level down you get to choose a stat to decrease (health, attack, etc.) By the end of the game you will have very low stats and would get killed in 4 or 5 hits by everything. Still, the bosses shouldn't be too powerfull so it's still fair, and by that point the game would be more dodging oriented.\nThoughts?"
nbcsym,Idea for a pc game.,"How do I start this...well, the games name is ""The Grackles chime"", the game starts with the sound of a Grackle (The crow-like sound, not tweetie bird.), And simply says ""They've awoken."" You play as a child and need to prepare weapons. You then go out. Try not to get k* lled by grackles, they hide EVERYWHERE. There's normal grackles, emperor and empress grackles. And the boss right is known as "" GOD GRACKLE"" with 6 wings. Let me know if u want not info!"
nbah4u,City War - multiplayer," \n\nI'd like to describe my idea for a game and see what you think about it, etc. This is just a very general draft of the game idea and it's totally open for all of your suggestions.\n\nSo it is a multiplayer game where before you start you can create your start own map, for example something like a town (based on city skylines) but with the very basic graphic. Then you can share this map on the server and other people can either create their own map (server) or join to your map. For example if five players will join to one map then the game starts.\n\nThese five players are spawned in five random places on the map and controls their characters from the first perspective view. The main goal for them is to destroy the let's say VIP building (the most imporstant building in the game, the aim for the players). But they are fighting with each other also, because only one person can win the game. Players can find some kind of weapons on a map. The host of the map is also playing but not as a person on the map like them but he has a camera like on the city skylines from the top so he sees all of the players and he has to protect somehow the VIP building and make it difficult for players to get there, for example he has to build some kind of walls, some security posts, turrets with plots, etc., so the players will see those things and have to somehow destroy or go workaround them. Of course the host has also something like limited cash to spend, but he can also earn that cash from some shops, factories on the map, and players can also destroy that kind of buildings to stop earning money by the host.\n\nSo this is my very general idea draft for a game, what do you think?"
nb9yw3,Web Game: Fake News,"This is an idea for a web game adaptation of a board game. Rule 2 says blatant copies aren't allowed but I don't know if this counts or not.\n\n So I recently started playing a web game called Gartic Phone, it's basically a web version of the board game Telestrations. So I thought, why not have a web game version of the card game Fake News?  \n\n\nHOW TO PLAY THE GAME (shorter explanation)  \n\- Each player gets 1-3 topic cards (which would be a setting)). Each topic card has a short phrase on it  \n\- Each player also gets 1 image card with an image  \n\- Each player also gets 1 audience card with a group of people listed on it (ex: Seniors)  \n\- Each player then makes up a news headline using the topic cards as a base, the image card as the idea, and the audience card of who the news headline is directed to  \n\- The game then shows every player each headline, (the topics, image, and audience cards being shown or not could be a setting)   \n\- Each player then gives a Winner, Runner Up, and FAKE NEWS! title to one card.   \n\- The winner is worth 3 points, Runner Up is worth 2, and FAKE NEWS! is worth 1 point. If you don't get any votes then it's 0 points  \n\- The game is for 4-8 players\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWEB LINKS (ideas)  \n\- [playfakenews.com](https://playfakenews.com)  \n\- [fakenewsgame.com](https://fakenewsgame.com) \n\n(the only reason I'm asking for someone to make this is because I want to play this online, credit me if you'd like but as stated in Rule 6 you don't have to)"
nb40e5,I want to design a gaming app for news ans social media i want some amazing ideas and be newly,
nb0nh7,Plant evolution game multiplayer,"I recently thought of a game where there is one huge server or maybe a couple. Everyone starts out picking some traits for a plant and you decide where you put it in the environment. From there you should spread and try to be the most well adapted plant to the environment. The server climate will change and there will be different biomes. But sometimes there will be lots of rains and sometimes very dry. My thought is that you could log out for a couple of days and come back on with your species still alive so it would be something going on for over a year if you commit to it. New players might join and invade your species with their plants and the inactive peoples plants will just die because they don't evolve them. THe more you spread the more points you can spend on evolving, might need some balance mechanic for that though so too well spread species aren't impossible too take down.\n\nTo me it sounds like a cool idea, especially if it is a passive game where you can log on like twice a week and check in on how well you are doing. There could also be a quicker game mode where everything is fast paced and is more like a Battle Royale :)"
nazsmw,"SKYBOUND RENEGADES: A Steam punk Base building, Heist game","A Base building, Guild management game where you pilot and manage a steam punk airship. \n\nPlayer controls a flying ship base, can function as a vehicle and a customizable base for npcs. \nCan fly to different floating islands and hubs, pick up adventurers and assign them missions.\n\nGain new clientele, which can grant you better reputation, as well as access to more loot from missions.\n\nThe base can also be piloted manually, in order to scout areas for missions. Manual piloting can also lead to space fights. The ship's power level will be based on the level of your clientele"

I hope you're doing good.\n\nWhat can be a player for endless 2d runner game.\n\nInjection vs virus as obstacle\n\nGhost player vs  ghost obstacle\n\nPlease tell me if you have any idea of what can be the player and obstacles in a 2d endless runner game.\n\nThanks in advance
nat21h,I want some ideas for gaming app about news but I want some amazing ideas and newly I want ideas to be attractive,"My dream is to design an application about games news, no. I want some new and distinctive ideas, and I want to make an application with a new idea. Can you give me some ideas"
nas91x,The Breaking Cheese Wheel,"This game would be a 2D game where you are in a cheese factory killing all the workers. Boss Fights would be where you can grab the workers and through them onto machines to kill them! I really do want some ideas and criticism so if you had some, please comment some ideas."
nas6ym,What are thoughts on flairs by genre instead of flairs by scale?,"Our current flair system is oriented around scale, where you indicate the size and complexity of the idea. This doesn't feel all that helpful to me. A lot of people don't know how complex or large their idea is for starters (Looking at you ""Beginner MMORPG""). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSecondly, I see a decent number of requests for ideas by genre, and it would be really helpful to those people if a person could filter to ideas by genre. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThird, I just don't see the value in declaring the scale and scope of your idea. I'm looking for ideas, concepts and themes, not design documents, stories and worldbuilding. The different between a AAA game and a lofi indie game is usually more about polygons, texture and scale than it is about mechanics and gameplay, and when it's not you can usually tell by the genre."
napn1d,"You harness the power of your enemies, but it's online","The idea would be of a MMORPG but instead of choosing a class, you only start with a basic auto-attack skill. When you slay a monster, its body immediately decays and disappears. Except sometimes it doesn't. When it doesn't you can harness a skill from the monster and that's a new skill you can use yourself.\n\nYou would build your character based on the skills you obtain and maybe based on the items too. You could actually select a class in the beginning but it would be mostly passive skills.\n\nEventually, you'll run into powerful monsters that let you get special skills. The strongest monsters, found at the end of difficult dungeons, would have a slight chance to not decay and to let you obtain very powerful endgame skills."
nanpx7,Some ideas for gaming news app 😃 i want some amazing ideas I want new ideas?,"What are the good ideas for the application, news of the games, I want new and attractive ideas, not simple ideas"

naj4j1,I need your help,So I'm trying to make a that you can have a lot of fun with friends or your self like dead matter but i don't know how to implement it into my own creation and I'm terrible at coming up with things so maybe you can help me??
nag62b,I had an idea I'm hoping you can see if it's good,Its basicly an open world ghost hunter that you and or your friends can go about the world but there will be areas where you can find people who want your help and you can level up by doing these missions and learn skills to help find and destroy the ghost/being this kinda came into my head while watching supernatural and x files
naedug,"I want to create a games news program, but I want ideas so that the program is unique?","I want the news to have a new idea and program. Very nice, but I want some new and distinctive ideas, not simple ideas."
naeaoc,A Super Mario 3rd Person Shooter Hero Game,"And I don't mean like GUNS guns, but just silly things that shoot Bullet Bills or something. For some reason PVZ Garden Warfare comes to mind but you have the Mushroom Kingdom Vs. the Koopa Kingdom and you get to choose from various characters, customize their look and their powers. Maybe even be able to create your own Hero/Villain like make a Brother/Princess or a Koopa, or at least customize their looks a bit. I really wish this was a thing, Nintendo plz"
nae40o,a platformer but you can rotate the level with a press of a button,And you would need to rotate the level to complete them
nae0ci,"Tower defense or Minecraft like, building combo mechanic.","So this is an idea I had while watching a streamer play a building game.\n\nThe idea is that like a normal building game you can place buildings. However when upgrading the building you instead build other buildings on top of the first.\n\nHere is a simple image explaining to show the concept: [https://i.imgur.com/X3Lpm3L.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/X3Lpm3L.jpg)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is probably possible to build the game around this simple idea. In a Minecraft like it will be about clever and good looking designs, in a tower defense it is more about what happens when buildings are combined."
nacoz1,Interesting Game Idea,"I have they cool idea for a game that just randomly popped into my head for literally no reason.\n\nImagine a post apocalyptic game being marketed as the next big single player story telling game with many groundbreaking features and epic missions. While you play through the game you fight numerous enemies that are hunting you while you are on your quest. They will do almost anything to prevent you from reaching your goal. Your goal is to round up the last of humanity to have a fighting chance to survive the apocalypse.\n\nThe thing the players won’t know when they are playing the game is that all those enemies that they have been disposing of have been actual players that have also bought the game.\n\nThey are all human (the same as the player character) but due to a mind virus that has infected the entire population, they all see each other as hideous violent monsters enabling a reaction in the player’s mind to shoot and kill each other.\n\nThe player does not discover this until the very end of the game, where they realize they have been destroying mankind’s last hope for survival without even realizing it.\n\nIt’s a bit crazy I know, but I just had to get it out of my mind. The game would be initially revealed in one of the announcements to have a multiplayer mode, but it would receive an announcement of it “being delayed or cut”. When in reality it was always there to begin with. \n\nI realize there are probably some legal problems with this such as false advertising, but it’s just an idea."
na99ts,Web Game Idea - Would you play a Cyberpunk text/ui based web game?,"Hello guys, just found this sub and wanted to give it a try. I have been trying to research games similar to one I'm creating with another dev but am having trouble finding similar communities. It is a web game in a similar vein to Kingdom of Loathing and Fallen London.  \n\n\n**The idea:** To build a cyberpunk world in a web game using modern web development libraries (React/Node if you are familiar). The game will have quest lines, combat, crafting, skill systems,  eventual player markets, asynchronous multiplayer elements. It will largely be text/ui/image based and combat will be skill/turn based.  \n\n\n**The gameplay hook:** Level your character via combat, grind for levels and items unlocking new skills. Augment your body and unlock new skill paths. Build up your crafting skills, make a fortune, open businesses. Meet interesting NPCs and experience complete storylines in a similar vein to Oblivion/Skyrim contained storylines (Mages Guild/Dark Brotherhood esque, self contained stories that open options outside of their questlines.) New storylines, city districts, skill paths, item types would come out in monthly/serial patches after release.  \n\n\nI appreciate your input as to whether you have played similar games to this and/or would be interested in something like this. Cheers."
na4p0j,In Need of an Idea,"As stated in the title, I am looking for an idea to make into a game. I am open to anything you guys have in mind."
na23tr,What Do You Guys Think About This Idea?,"  \n\nHello everybody hope you're having a good day, this was a quick draft I came up with last night and I want to hear your feedback. I want to know how to improve this and how you would improve this.\n\n**Story (Basic)**\n\nYou are an innocent civilian who has been kidnapped by a cult and you have to try and escape without getting killed by the demon.\n\n**Story (In-depth)**\n\nYour name is Mark Walterson, you're a 39 year old American male who worked as a trucker for 5 years. One day while doing your job, your truck breaks down in the middle of nowhere, so you hop out and try to fix it and then out of nowhere, you are knocked unconscious and kidnapped by a cult. Several hours pass and you finally wake up in a room deep underground with bodies all around you. After looking around you discover the name of the cult that kidnapped you and what they were up to but you also discover what killed the cult members and now that thing is out to get you. You can either try and escape or you can try to banish the demon to ensure that it doesn't hurt anyone/follow you home.\n\n**Gameplay**\n\nThe player will mostly walk around collecting items to aid their escape or fight/defeat the monster. If the player has no means of defending themselves, then they can try to hide in the various hiding spots around the area. \n\n**Mechanics**\n\nMonster: Randomly teleporting to different rooms, Ability to hear noises the player makes\n\nPlayer: Listening through doors to check for the monster, Hiding from the monster, sprinting cause why not"
na1j6i,Mortal Kombat MMORPG like WoW but with a built in fighting engine,The lore is all there and very deep. Many different realms and areas and unexplored locations. Create your own karacter and give them powers and fighting move set. \n\nLevel up by doing traditional quests a la Shaolin monks style of gameplay and challenge other players to a one on one traditional mortal Kombat fight. \n\nJoin and create your own klan and strongholds
n9z4cl,Skyrim but you are a gnome,Keeping this short and sweet as I'm on mobile. While watching Gnomeo and Juliet with my step-daughter i thought of this.\nTakes place in a backyard/s with factions being different garden gnomes and lawn1 ornaments.\nMechanically clunky battle like dark souls but instead of thematically dark and gritty blood have it upbeat and satirical setting. Could have the characters crack and shatter instead of the usual dismemberment.\nMain focus on exploration like BOTW\nStealth mechanics could include going unnoticed by humans while trying to sabotage the opposing faction\nThoughts?
n9sa73,"Discovery Tour by Assassin’s Creed, but as a current-day virtual holiday tool","Hello, so Assassin’s Creed Origins and Odyssey got “Discovery Tour” mode, which are educational fully-explorable open worlds based in the map of the main games. Hostiles, quests and objectives are removed, addition of guided tours to learn about the eras of Ancient Egypt/Greece and an ability to teleport anywhere and explore Egypt/Greece to your leisure without interruption.\n\nEver since Origins’ was released as well as the COVID-19 Pandemic and mass-lockdowns soon after, I am massively surprised at the fact we have no tool to explore other cities and attractions.\n\nA bit of a rundown as to what a “game” like this could entail, imagine you are put somewhere like Tokyo, Japan. The whole city is available to explore and teleport around. Brimming with pedestrians, culture and traffic. You can have a virtual tour of the Shibuya District, the Tokyo Tower or a neat shopping mall. Find little collectibles and souvenirs in hidden spots throughout the city. You can also have a bit of a walk across mount Fuji. All of this in AAA cutting-edge graphics mapped to how it’d look like in real life.\n\nThis framework could be used for virtual time travel and seeing different places in different eras and events. Even entire made-up fantasy world that can express different lore and worldbuilding. Having a walk around Hogwarts or Middle-Earth for instance.\n\nIts a dream of mine, thoughts?"
n9hnys,Games in cyberpunk-fantasy setting(?),"Which games do you guys know that combine cyberpunk setting with magic and other fantasy-like stuff? Only example I know is ""shadowrun"" series, and I am eager to find other interesting references"
n9ec5g,A Cowboy Bebop game that's a spiritual successor to Oni,This is less of an idea and more of a wet dream but I loved the mix of martial arts and gun play Oni had along with it's anime aesthetic. It seems like a perfect fit for game based on Cowboy Bebop's Spike. Add some ship combat to the mix and it would be perfect open world bounty hunting game.
n9atsq,First stage of Spore... Expanded!,"I've always loved the game spore by Maxis. A lot of people like the end game, but for me, I actually enjoyed the first few stages instead. I don't know if it's the creature creation, or the ability to customize/evolve the creature on my own, but I always thought it was really fun and haven't been able to find another game like it. \n\nIf I was to draw inspiration from the game, I'd focus on the first stage (cell stage: 2-D, top-down). With expanded mechanics such as more attack types (excretion of toxins, enzymes, etc), defensive mechanics (flagella for faster swim/""dodge"", extra sensors for enemy detection). The game loop would following something like: gather resources to survive (e.g. food), have your colony grow based on available resources, fight neighbouring colonies for their resources. Evolve or acquire more genes (i.e. ""abilities"") to better gather more resources to invade or defend against other colonies.  \n\nIs this something you would play? Did I miss the mark completely on why spore is so enticing for other players? If you could recreate and expand on one aspect of Spore, what would it be?"
n9a856,A Valve Game Crossover,"I love video game crossovers. However, my idea is a little complicated. Here's the backstory: A virus is breaking the source code for all main Valve games, and the G-Man realizes how devastating it would be (because he's all-knowing or something), so he travels to different source code games (TF2, DoTA, etc.) to find the strongest and smartest heroes to combat the virus. (I got this idea when I saw a post about a hacker in TF2 pulling Half-Life 2 assets like the G-Man model into a game of MvM)\n\nLink to MvM hacker: [https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/mf7h6q/well\_this\_happened\_in\_a\_mvm\_match\_he\_picked\_up/](https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/mf7h6q/well_this_happened_in_a_mvm_match_he_picked_up/)\n\nBut anyways, the game will go throughout each Source game, similar to how JJBA: EOH does with the different parts of the series, with the G-Man recruiting different characters from each game. Each part will have virus fights in a FPS style (because a majority of Valve games are FPS) and then after the fights, G-Man shows up and takes the fighters. I haven't really thought about what happens after G-Man gets the team he needs together, probably have the smart ones locate the virus while the fighters hold off the virus.\n\nThe title will probably be something along the lines of Half-Life 3: Source Breakdown because it starts with Half-Life G-Man and all that jazz, plus the virus breaking down the Valve Source code.\n\nThe first part will be Half-Life, then the second part will be TF2.

n8xpku,For Horizontal and/ or Vertical Scrolling Shooters (4 out of ? In Game Idea Series),"Alot of the time if ya think about a Scrolling Shooter you've played ya can only shoot in one direction but can move to anywhere on the screen\n\nWell to improve on that there can be 1 of 2 things done that always Scrolling Shooters to break new ground:\n\n1. The simple solution can be to keep movement the same having ship face only one direction when moving with ability to shoot in a 360° radius with mouse/ right thumb stick so ya move while still being able to shoot enemies at the side and behind you\n\n2. For a more hardcore &amp; little more complicated Vertical, Overhead Horizontal, Straight, Horizontal, etc Scrolling Shooter experience ya can have it where say your ship/ dragon/ whatever ya use can go forward &amp; backwards with up/ down (or W &amp; S keys) and can turn ship with left/ right (or A &amp; D Keys) to add a 360° range to not only your shooting but also your movement (with an optional choice to make it where if your ship accidentally hits or goes off screen then it will die losing you one life)"

n8rlpa,Recursive game within a game,"It would start as a game that contains itself within it. Some games have already done this, like Celeste. But that game would also have itself within it, and so on, with graphics getting slightly worse every time. The hardest levels would require you to go many levels of recursion in, to the point where you are nearly blind.\n\nA slight spinoff of this is a game that requires you to make itself. Play testing the game within a game would be very similar to the normal game, maybe with a little different controls. I imagine a few levels of recursion in, elements would start glitching out, and you would be stuck in this nightmare scape.\n\nWhat do you think? It’s not very fleshed out, but it does seem possible, though maybe tough to make."
n8ix78,What's your opinion on Card Game Making Engine? An engine for user to make specific digital collective card game without any programming knowledge.,"I planned to work on making card game engine build for specific card game,the user can create or modify Cards,Booster Packs,Story via Visual Novel Editor and plenty more and the only constant is the Card Gameplay Mechanic based on specific engine the user purchased.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWill there be any interest on engine specifically tailored to make their own game project based on card game regardless of their programming language experience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe engine will be commercially available as i want to make a career out of it and to finance arts resources for future engine build,but would only sell with modest fee's like as 5$ or below as i want to make it accessible to many to try and also may charge very small sum if they want to make their project as executable that they can then sell it commercially.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo i would like to listen to fellow redditor opinions on what feature suitable to be on the engine.So far the outline of the engine are:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMenu\n\n* Entirely customizeable with own arts and fonts\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTutorial\n\n* On first time launch,the tutorial will cover each all the necessary section on the software usage.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEditor\n\n* There are few editing options such as Cards,Card Back,Players,Decks,Packs, and Story Mode.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCards\n\n* The card game gameplay will be constant,in this example we used an unique card gameplay.\n* Cards can be edited every possible way\n* Card Image can be Imported and Resized.\n* User can edit all the card data like Names,Rarity,Mana,Faction,Attack Points and etc.\n* User also can able to generate card data using Procedeurally Generated Method (Card Names and Card Images not included).\n* There is no restriction on how any cards can be created,though a million cards seems redundant although it may\* not have much impact on the engine performance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCard Back\n\n* User can Import image for Card back\n* Card back will be needed to be assign to deck in order to be used.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlayers\n\n* Use can create as many card player or duelist as they prefer.\n* User can Import or Resized Image for individual player.\n* User also can assign deck to each individual player.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDecks\n\n* Deck can created either by manually or Procedeurally Generated Method.

(If there is copyrighted material sent which intended to be used to be sold,then i would have to reject it)\n* Currently there is only 3 platform of the project can be build and distributed (Window, HTML5 and Android)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is your opinion/suggestion/feedback on this project? If you are interested in this specific engine, what  reasonable suggestion would you like to make?"

n8b0iv,Need suggestions how to simplify building in an automation game.,"Hello, we are making a 3d game that is a blend of satisfactory and first person shooter. However, for this game, the building style of satisfactory or factorio is too complex, as we would like it to be focused more on combat and gathering resources. Specifically, we would like to remove the need to manually connect every building by a conveyor belt, which what is we find to be the most tedious/difficult part when building a huge factory. What we have come up so far is to either have a large number of drones that autonomously run between buildings and distribute resources, or make buildings somehow autoconnect to each other. For people that find games like factorio too boring or overwhelming, how would you suggest to simplify the building process so that it would be more fun for you?\n\nThank you for your suggestions!"
n8asxi,Another one. (And yes it's a little longer but I'm sure y'all will enjoy it)(3 out of ?),"If you have played an Endless Runner in the past then you'll have realized that Endless Runners aren't really Endless in a way. \n\nTo put it bluntly Endless Runners only goes for as long as you can/ decide to play it for and no matter how far ya are in the Run and want to continue it ya have no choose besides quiting by killing yourself, losing by an obstacle/ enemy or keep going\n\n\n\nSo here's my solution to make Endless Runners truly Endless:\n\nMilestones - Where when ya get to certain points in the ER you can save your run and continue it at another day or time\n\nIf ER games started being built with this while still having Milestones being a toggle-able option to have on/ off (that way ya can still have option to play it in the regular way without milestones whenever ya want as well) then it would bring ER's to new heights making them TRUE Endless Runners since you're grinding across different days/ times to get a highscore as high as ya can whenever ya want)\n\n(And for quality of life ya can adjust settings to pick whether or not the game will ease you back into the run when ya come back or place you right where you were, no matter how fast ya were going/ how crazy things were whenever ya left, and continue from there, etc etc for settings)\n\nTo make the gameplay even more enjoyable ya can have it also be an Action-Endless Runner where ya slash enemies (2 finger swipe) and/ or shoot enemies (tap) while avoiding obstacles (1 finger swipe to move around screen), ability to wall-run infinitely and ability to go back and forth whenever from floor, walls, &amp; roof flipping the camera view everytime ya do that\n\nAnd to prevent it from being a simple move from either roof, walls, or floor it can be like this as well to add a more tactical and free movement way to it:\n\n  _   _   _   _   _\n|                      |\n|                      |             _  _  _\n|                      |           |           |\n|                      |           |           |\n| _   _   _   _   _| or      | _  _  _ |\n\n(Each line represents where ya can move to on screen depending on where you swiped to so basically the walls, roof, and floor all have 3 or 5 spots ya can move to, maybe even have some sections where ya need to be in somewhere in middle/ mid-air not on one of the sides to not get hit by doing a swipe to move from one side to another to be in mid-air)\n\nI know it's long but hope it inspired someone and are willing to pick and choose what to do from this\n\n(I'm going to make my own suggestions a series but this one is the only one I think that was super long)"

n8adhc,Keeping Somewhat Simple for this One (compared to games out today),A Megaman Battle Network Successor\n\nNo game has ever to my knowledge done the movement &amp; combat of the Megaman Battle Nexus Games and that game model could be used for any kind of setting/ story/ enemies\n\nAnd maybe there could be also be multiple playable protagonists throughout the game (with the protagonists all against each other and affecting each other's future events) and maybe add some verticality in some way (different levels to go between for platforms) for the combat\n\nIf ya haven't played those games I HIGHLY recommend an Emulator on PC/ Series X|S since all 10-11 Games in that spin-off Megaman series are only on Gameboy Advance
n88pzd,Turn based combat with a network based movement system,"Most games with turn based combat use one of two systems to track positioning.  Either movement takes place on a grid, like chess, checkers, dnd, fire emblem, or they don't deal with movement at all in combat, although sometimes they still use positioning.  Earthbound makes a distinction between upper and lower rows of enemies while persona can make you start a battle face to face or surrounded by enemies. \n\nI'd like to see a game which uses a graph like thise used in graph theory.  Battle maps would look something like [this](https://images.app.goo.gl/bh4oGQw4h8ZSRA248).  Along with you're normal action which you use to attack, use an item, cast magic, or whatever is in your system, you can also move. \n\nOf course, what this mechanic would do depends entirely on the mechanics of the game you're making, but here are some ideas basic ideas.\n\n* Melee attacks only work when you share a node with your enemy.\n\n* Ranged attacks work best a certain number of edges away, how many depends on the weapon. \n\n* When there are two more players on a node than enemies, you are given a considerable advantage on that node.\n\n* AOEs effect everyone on a node, regardless of side.\n\n* Edges can be blocked by either side.  Alternatively, either side can stop an enemy from retreating by continuously attacking them. \n\n* You can only heal or use an item on someone sharing a node.\n\n* Retreating is easier n edges away.\n\n* Knockback. \n\n* Passive buffs and debuffs only work n edges away.\n\n* Status effects that impede movement."
n84yfy,Titanfall 3,"I know that this would be a sequel to titanfall 2, but ea does not give a damm about this series. For the campaign, I would make the main storyline about cooper trying to refind bt, but you would also have side stories, like battlefields war stories, telling the views of all the factions.\n\nFor multiplayer I would not change Much. I would make it so that there are more Titans in the game, and more powerful customization (ex: viper jets for North Star). Also would make a vanguard class titan that would be like Titans from titanfall 1. Also would add more weapons and unique tacticals.\n\nThere are more things, but I would like to ceap it short. Tell me your ideas in the comets."
n83b4p,Katamari damacy but it's competitive MP and also when you get rolled by a bigger player you keep playing as a orbiting cannon shooting out the crap you rolled to disturb other players and help out your devourer,"Ideally played with a large amount of players, game keeps popping in new crap to roll so the level doesn't empty out.\n\nProbably too big of a game to execute considering it'd rely on both physics and MP with a lot of players. \n\nLastly you don't need to be a cannon specifically when you get rolled in, just something that keeps you playing while also shifting the game from competitive every man for himself to competitive team play."
n81pvd,A survival game set in a constantly changing world,"As a heads up, I am unsure of the exact rating for this idea, and it might be best under the ""Experienced"" flair. Depends on how advanced the graphics and actual gameplay are, I suppose.\n\nThe basic story would be that your colony ship crash-landed on this planet, and you and the other survivors need to survive in a building made within the radius of your ship. The next day, everything outside of the radius of your ship has changed. Maybe the planet is an ever-changing space entity, maybe it just phases through alternate versions of itself every day. Either way, the map changes regularly. The ship could resist changes due to it being made of material not from this planet, or maybe another explanation that wouldn't be questioned.\n\nThere would be a separate chance for things outside the radius of the crashed ship to change, and the farther away from the ship the thing is, the more likely it is to change. For instance, the forest immediately around your ship will either stay the same or maybe the types of trees will spontaneously change, while a mile away from the ship, an entire mountain range could disappear overnight. Stockpiled items would also not be safe from this, so a few of your wooden logs might disappear or even change into steel or gold, depending on how far from the ship they are. \n\nThis would apply to sentient NPCs as well, so you should get all of your colonists as close as possible to the ship before night falls. If an NPC gets caught out at night, they will change. Some will have minor changes, such as a different gender, name, or a different set of skills. Others will have major changes, such as turning into an animal or becoming hostile, or even an alien creature. These changes could happen to hostile NPCs as well, such as a hostile person becoming friendly and an alien changing into a human.\n\nThe end goal could either be to survive long enough to be rescued, or thrive enough to build your own ship, or even just have an endless game where you see how long your colony can survive."

It is controlled similar to the Arkham Games, and Batman can punch, glide, grapple and use Batarangs, as well as a Batmobile, Batwing and Batboat.\n\n2nd game: Michael Keaton's Batman joins forces with the late Christopher Reeves' Superman, in a ploy to stop Lex Luthor and Poison Ivy from taking over America.

n7ue9n,An idea for a game mechanic based on how you precieve certain characters,"You know how sometimes in a game, the main character might percieve a character differently than how you percieve it? For example, a game could frame a certain character as annoying while the player themselves may view them as charming.\n\nSo, I was thinking. What if certain games could have a dialogue system in place that changes what you think of certain characters? You could think of them as attractive, charming, or just a generally good person, or you could think of them as annoying, deplorable, and generally a bad person.\n\nSome of these options wouldn't be available depending on the character, such as;\n\n\- You can sympathize with villians, but you can't idolize them or look at them generally positively\n\n\- You can't think of characters that aren't human(iod), aren't above 18, and/or don't have the intellegence to consent as ""attractive"" nor can you view certain characters as attractive if it would be jarring, disturbing, or immersion breaking\n\nWhat do you think?"
n7tirq,An action sci fi game that explores the native life inside of Jupiter,"Feel free to use this idea. The game revolves around hypothetical life inside of Jupiter. \n\nThe dominant life form on Jupiter are floating jellyfish-like organisms called the Gejurotixm. They are intelligent, have a language, and spawn these big bubble-like structures that function as floating cities.   As photosynthetic organisms, they need to spend some time up high (but not too high) to gather sunlight, as well as the radiation from space.  These organisms are about 4 feet tall, and are relatively peaceful with other members of their species.  They are chemovores, in that they consume chemical compounds from the air for food.\n\nEnemies:  There are also savage creatures that the Gejurotixm must contend with. The Mwsouti are manta ray type organisms that hunt and kill the Gejurotxim for food.  Qspikazb are winged centipede-like beings that will attack just about anything, including each other.  Thopsidleh are hovering orange blobs that spit a corrosive substance.  The Lopoodo are unpredictable wormlike beings that rapidly evolved from viruses on a probe from Earth that was sent into Jupiter’s atmosphere, making them semi-earthlings and the only aliens in the game.  There are others too.\n\nThe protagonist: You are a Gejurotxim warrior guardian. Your mission to to defend your kind against the many threats of Jupiter.  Sometimes, you will be defending cities or Gejurotxim expeditions on their resource gathering operations down below.  Other times, you will go on search and destroy missions.  Sometimes, you will be patrolling, and may even need to deal with criminal Gejurotxim that pirate chemical compounds from peaceful cities.\n\nLife:  You have both hit points and energy points. You lose hit points when you are attacked, and you gradually lose energy when you go down below the point where light can be absorbed.  When either meter reaches 0, you’re dead.  You suffer damage when you fly too low or too high.  Hit points can only be recovered by entering a city and joining your tentacled with another of your species.  They heal each other through the process of Cntiyidal.\n\nExperience and levels:  Your gain experience by killing enemies and completing missions.  As you go up in levels, you acquire hit points, energy points, stronger attacks, and more combat moves.\n\nCombat capabilities:  Your primary attack is a tentacle lash, which whips enemies.  Later, you can spit acid, strangle, encapsulate and devour, lay corrosive spores, shoot sharp spines, impale, etc.\n\nMusic and sound effects:  The “music” should sound like the sound effects from the movie “Forbidden Planet”: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unSrf-htPbk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unSrf-htPbk). None of the music or sound effects should resemble anything human.  The music should be more mild in a safe layer of the atmosphere, and harsher sounding as you travel into more dangerous zones that are to high or too low.  Speech should sound like bizarre garbled sounds, with the text of what they’re saying at the bottom of the screen.\n\nThe game is almost total action with little story, aside from tidbits that you pick up from talking with other Gejurotxim.  It’s open world and endless. You can save your game when you’re done playing. The map constantly changes, since Jupiter is a gas giant.\n\nMultiplayer: Players can play as groups by logging on to the server and joining games together.  There are also tournaments and death matches where players can fight with each other.\n\nFeel free to contribute to this idea, or to use it."

n7st3w,"What are your video game ideas that you want turned into a video game for the latest Playstation home game console, latest Xbox home game console, or the latest Nintendo home game console?","This is mine: \n\n(Action-Adventure Hack and Slash Sandbox MMORPG) \n\nWhen you lock on to the battle zone or enter the battle zone, you will hear all the microphones of the players participating in the battle.  Players will also hear your microphone during combat.  Outside of combat, you can lock on to any player and listen to that player's microphone.  The player can also listen to your microphone.  All parties / guild players can always hear each other's microphones, even if the players are in completely different locations.  You can mute anyone's microphone at any time.\n\n To hear a person's mic outside the battle zone, lock on to another player or create / extend one open mic zone.  You can create an open mic zone only if you are not in another player's open mic zone.  The open mic zone creates an invisible barrier that surrounds the creator, including players within the radius of the barrier, without blocking anything.  The open mic zone allows all players in the barrier to participate in open mic parties.  Join with the push of a button and you'll hear all players' microphones from all players in the open mic zone.  Open mic parties are different from regular parties and guilds.  When you leave the open mic zone, you are no longer a member of the party.  For microphones, all mute options are always available.\n\n There are customizations for height, children / adults, fat / thin, clothes, equipment, armor, appearance, weapons, abilities, movements, skills, magic, and summons.  Customizing the appearance of the character is similar to the game ""God Eater 2"" and the game ""Sword Art Online: Hollow Realization"".  You can create up to 4 characters.  You can switch to control one character or one of ""your"" other created party members.  The character's AI can be set in the same way as in the game ""Star Ocean: Until the end of time"".  You can play the game with any character you create.  You can switch control of the party character at any time.  If you don't want to control your ""own"" character during battle, just set the character to AI.\n\n There are several specific places where you can talk to different NPC characters and enter different servers to advance the story.  These servers warp / teleport ""your"" different party characters to any section of the current story.  Each server has a limited number of players, and each server has all players of the same level within 10 intervals (eg Server 1-Level 1-10, Server 2-Level 10-20).  You can always enter a server above your level, but you cannot enter a server below your level.  You can earn certain things by completing different parts of the story.  There are many side stories, hidden ones, and optional ones, which are not part of the story.  There are also many gates and portals similar to the game "".hack: Infection"", where you can choose different servers and experiment with different dungeons.\n\n To engage in combat, you can either attack someone / something or be attacked by someone / something.  A character / player will not gain experience unless that character / player hits an opponent at least once.  The hit must be a hit even if the damage dealt is 0, not the damage caused by the status effect.  During the battle, the radius of the battle zone is automatically set according to the position of the first participant.  Only the first combat participant can lock the combat zone at any time.\n\n Locked battle zones have invisible barriers that keep battle participants inside, blocking entry into all other zones.  If the battle zone is unlocked, other players / characters outside the battle zone can join the battle zone and gain experience points.  You can only gain experience points if you are in the same battle zone as the enemy you defeated when you defeated it.  All different enemies have different amounts of experience points that players earn during their defeat.  If the enemy is defeated by multiple participants, the experience points will be evenly divided among those participants.  If there are no players in the battle zone for more than 2 minutes, it will no longer be an existing battle zone.  There are harsh environments that your character may not be able to tolerate.  The item ""Magic Battle Zone Lock"" creates a locked battle zone that surrounds you, including all players within the radius, and blocks fire, water, etc.\n\n Players cannot attack another non-enemy player unless one player achieves ""G"" status or offers a player-versus-player challenge option.  To provide player-versus-player challenges, get close enough to ""lock on"" to another player, select challenge options, and extend one battle zone barrier that surrounds all players / targets.  ..  All player-versus-player challenge participants must be within the battle zone barrier.  All players in the battle zone must select the option to accept the challenge to start the battle.  The battle music option for this battle allows you to vote / agree or randomly select one playlist from one participant.  ""G"" status is achieved when the bar / meter is full, either by attacking the target or by being attacked for some reason.  ""G"" is a ""special"" that all players can ""use"" with the push of a button.  If you achieve ""G"" status, you will not be an enemy of other players until you attack.  Once you reach ""G"" status, you cannot be attacked by any player until you attack that player or participate in a player-versus-player challenge.\n\n If a ""G"" attacks a non-enemy player in a battle zone, that ""G"" cannot lock that battle zone.  ""G"" gains all experience points from the defeated ones, unless those ""Gs"" do not attack allies.  The ""G"" status lasts for 11 minutes.  When you defeat a ""G"", that ""G"" loses its ""G"" status, is no longer an enemy, and anyone can revive the player.  ""Gs"" cannot steal or mug anything from other players unless they are ""King"" / ""Queen"", ""Boss"", or ""Elite"" characters.  Also, ""Gs"" cannot steal or mug anything from other players unless they are participating in a player-versus-player challenge.  If four or more ""G"" s attack an ally in a battle zone, that battle zone achieves ""Frenzy"" and all players can attack all players.  The frenzy battle zone can only be locked by King / Queen, Boss, and Elite characters / players.\n\n When a player dies, that player can wait to be resurrected by someone else.  Alternatively, the player can choose the option to return to the entrance to the place where the player died, choose a server to return to the open world, or go to the equipment graveyard.  If you die more than 10 times, the option to return to the entrance to the place of death will not be available.  Your mic still works while you are dead.  You cannot earn experience points or items while you are dead.\n\n There are many continents on the map.  All continents are made up of zones.  Each zone has its own enemies and neutrals.  In most cases, all enemies and / or neutrals in each zone are at about the same level within the zone.  When all enemies in the zone have been defeated or all achievements in the zone have been completed, the last remaining players must fight each other.  Anyone who conquers a zone has the title of ""boss"" for that zone, and that player can choose the enemies in that zone.  Players select those enemies based only on all enemies defeated in the game, except for all defeated players.  Also includes boss enemies (different color schemes for boss enemies).  Players also select the level of those enemies, but only up to the highest level of enemies they have defeated so far.  If a ""boss"" player's zone is conquered by another player, that ""boss"" player loses the ""boss"" title.\n\n There is one king / queen per continent, either as a player or an NPC.  All Kings / Queens will now have 4 elite characters.  Defeat King / Queen in battle to earn his / her crown and title.  Kings / Queens can choose an elite character from their list of friends or from AI characters created by King / Queen players.  When you become a King / Queen, you can get a special item ""Crown"" that raises your stats.  You can keep the crown equipped even if you are not a king / queen, but you cannot wear it visually unless you are a king / queen.  Elite characters are kings / queens, as long as the kings / queens who made them elite remain kings / queens.  Kings / Queens can enter any battle zone at any time, even if they are locked.  Kings / Queens can attack any character they like at any time, including other players.\n\n When you reach a boss / mini boss in a dungeon, temple, story progress, cave, castle, etc., the battle zone may be locked by another player who is fighting the boss / mini boss.  You can go up to something that looks important nearby.  Example: A small statue nearby.  At the push of a button, you will be given the option to fight the boss / mini boss alone or with other players on another server.  You will not be able to rematch with the boss / mini boss unless you re-enter the entrance.  You can enter the server with various parties.  Any part of the game can be completed solo or party.  A party can consist of all players and all AI characters created by the player for that player's party.  There are servers with lobbies for dungeons, temples, caves, castles, etc., and players in those lobbies have to wait for the lobby to fill up so that they can enter dungeons, temples, caves, castles, etc.  ..\n\n There are summons obtained by leveling up, summons obtained by achievements, and summons obtained by defeating enemies.  When you defeat the big bosses you face in the game, most of them will be earned as ""summons"".  You can only have a limited number of ""summons"".  The Summon option allows you to summon one ""summon"" to perform one of the most powerful attacks, or control the ""summon"" as an AI party member.  When summoned as a party member, you can switch between the control of the summon and the control of the created character.  Summons are only summoned for 4 minutes.  If you unsummon a Summon, you will have to wait 4 minutes before you can use the Summon option again.  If you complete a very powerful attack summoned with the Summon option, you will have to wait 4 minutes before you can use the summon again.\n\n There are mounts you can get.  Traveling with mounted beasts etc. makes traveling much easier.  You can get a ""mount"" for travel by tame them with items or defeat them in battle.  While moving with a mounted beast / ""summon"", it can take some damage before the player is knocked off or the mount gets confused.  At higher levels of speed racing, you can be attacked by racers.  Also, at higher levels of speed racing, others who are not racers can attack you.  If you tame the same species many times, it will be available as a pet or ""summon"" and can be summoned at any time.  Some mounts can move on / in any terrain, including water, walls, mountains, and even trees, so you can reach hidden areas, hidden treasures / enemies / ""summons"", and more.  Some species have the ability to fly.  There are also cars that you can drive for an easier trip.  ..\n\n You don't need a beast / summon to fly.  There are items you can get that give your party the ability to ""fly"".  With these items you can ""fly"" for 10 minutes.  There is a way to permanently acquire the ability to ""fly"".  In flight, it's the same as in the game Kingdom Hearts 2, unless you select the Ascend option.  Select the Ascend option to allow you to fly freely in all heights and directions.  There is one button you can hold to automatically fly towards a locked-on object / ally / enemy.  With the ""fly"" ability, you can reach floating or hidden areas such as floating dungeons, floating temples, floating castles, floating islands, hidden treasures, enemies, and ""summons"".\n\n There are competitive flight races and other races that you can participate in to win valuables.  Your character can gain the ability to transform your character's visual form into a variety of obtained visual forms.  One such visual form that your character can get is the form of a beast.  These visual forms are abilities.  You can unequip these abilities and select other options such as double summoning.  You can customize your character's race, color, appearance, and more at any time, except during combat.\n\n There is an ability called ""Unlimited Jump"" similar to ""Double Flight"" in the game ""Kingdom Hearts: Fragmented Passage"", but it is not limited to double.  Like the anime ""Bleach"", there is a function called ""Ground Lock"" that allows you to land in the air and run around as if there is an invisible ground in the air.  It turns off every time something / someone hits you.  With these two abilities, you can reach floating and hidden areas such as floating dungeons, floating temples, floating castles, floating islands, hidden treasures, enemies, and ""summons"".  There is another ability called ""teleport"".  Teleport to a random location next to a locked-on object / ally / enemy.  Every time you use this ability four times, you have to wait four minutes before you can use it again.\n\n All player characters can be leveled up to a maximum level of 370.  There are several level 400 optional ultimate bosses.  Some of these bosses always leave the player with a legendary object when the Ultimate Boss is defeated.  There are a wide variety of legendary objects, including crowns.  You can level lock your character whenever you want.  This will prevent your character from gaining experience until you turn level lock off.\n\n Tournaments vary.  Players defeat players, players defeat computers, teams defeat teams, teams defeat computers.  The status of players such as bosses, kings, and elites will be displayed next to their names if those characters are locked on by other characters.  As long as the other player is not an enemy, you are guaranteed to be able to see the other player's health bar.  There are items that can be used to warp to friends' locations, etc.  These items can be purchased or obtained.  When you warp to a friend's location, you will be teleported to the entrance to that friend's location or where the friend is.\n\n Equipment graveyards are places where all equipment lost / discarded by all players is scattered everywhere.  There are no enemies other than the player or multiple players who can attack you.  You can also approach a weapon or equipment and challenge it with the push of a button.  This allows you to fight the ghost copy of the player to whom the weapon or equipment / armor once belonged.  This includes the player's level / stats / abilities / skills / ""summons"" and more.  The ghost's weapon / equipment is in the same state as when the owner lost / discarded it.  When you defeat the ghost, you can acquire the weapon / equipment, and the weapon / equipment will be in the same state as when the ghost used it.  Only the player who challenges the weapon or equipment can get the weapon or equipment after defeating the weapon or equipment.\n\n All weapons / equipment have levels, stats, and optional qualities / effects.  All weapons / equipment can be leveled up and changed through the ""Inner World of Equipment"", as in the game ""Disgaea: Hour of Darkness"".  The color schemes of all enemies and all bosses are different there.  You can reset your weapon to level 1 if needed.  Doing this will reduce the statistics, but the appearance, quality / attributes, and ""effect"" will remain the same.\n\n You can always get things or buy things for their appearance.  With the exception of abilities, skills, ""summons"", crowns, and trophies, you can ""hold"", discard, exchange, or sell whatever you like.  You can give money to anyone you want.  You can get or unlock ""optional visual appearance"" stuff such as pointed ears, tails, various wings, wing colors, accessories, glasses / shades, jewelry, markings, tattoos and more.  All ""visual appearance"" combinations, except the character's visual form obtained from ""abilities"", can be achieved as soon as you start this video game.  Not all varieties are available for immediate sale, but any player can acquire, trade, or sell them.  Most of them are for sale from the beginning, and many are ridiculously expensive, but any player can give you free money or get you to get it.  You can't buy or get anything with real money.  Strictly speaking, it's just in-game money.\n\n There are different types of items, weapons, equipment, and cards with the same name.  These types include differences in ""look"" / appearance, statistics, abilities, effects, and attributes.  If a player uses the ""player skill"" ""steal"" / ""mug"" against another player, only weapons and equipment can be stolen.  You cannot use the ""player skill"" ""stealing"" / ""mug"" against other players who are not enemies.  Stealing attacks / techniques / skills can only be used during ""battle"".  When used against a player, the chances of ""stealing success"" vary between 5%, 10%, and 15%.  If you use it against non-players, your chances are much higher.\n\n You can collect cards and have the ability to turn enemies into cards like in the game ""Final Fantasy VIII"".  You can play card games with other players, exchange cards, get cards from enemies, treasures, prizes and more.  Cards can be converted into items.  Strong and rare cards can be turned into the best and rarest items.  You can challenge random players / NPCs to ""card games"" except during ""battle"".  There are card tournaments held in various places.  You can listen to or mute the microphone while playing cards.  You can also skip directly to playing a card game from the title menu, which has a server that you can enter just to play cards.  All cards and items are shared between characters in the actual game and in the title screen card game.  There are different card game rules in different places.  If no rules are set, players will either play with the agreed rules or the rules will be randomly selected.  The player who becomes the ""boss"" of a zone can choose the card rules for that zone.  Players who become ""King"" / ""Queen"" can choose the card rules of the card game that ""King"" / ""Queen"" plays.\n\n Idea by Jeffrey Robert Palin Jr."
n7qjm7,Feedback on Plattformer/Roguelite/Tower Defense Idea,"I have this idea that i want to work on, but i'm not sure if it would be worth the time. So i want to hear your feedback\n\nThe idea is relativly simple:\n\nIt would controls like a typical 2D plattformer from the 8/16bit era with the added feature of simple melee combat. One would then be placed inside a proceduraly generated level, filled with enemies and treasure and the in the middle the exit, and then have a certain amount of time to collect money, upgrades and towers.\n\nOnce the time is up the tower defense parts comes in, as then hordes of enemy swarm in to destroy the exit and you defend it with your towers, while you're still plattforming. If it's destroyd it's game over. At the end of the wave a boss comes and after he is defeated you move on to the next stage.\n\nTldr. Jump and run with procedural levels, where you collect items to later defend yourself from hords of enemy"

n7lgat,Bookmaking game,"Hi everyone,\n\nI don't know any game where you play as a bookmaker, taking bets and choosing odds on matches/competitions.\n\nIn my mind, I'd mix it with a sci-fi theme. You've been entrusted with a portfolio of racing games of a distant off-world by a mafia boss. Each week, he is expecting you to pay tribute. The more you make money and pay within the deadline, the more he trusts you, the more your portfolio grows. From one planet, you get a system, then two, etc.\n\nEach new planet brings its share of new competitors and circuits, this way the mechanics are added at the speed the player understand the game mechanics.\n\nBefore each race, you have a screen with the information on each contestants: his speed, health, stamina... but also his popularity. Some information are hidden, and you have to ""buy"" them if you think they will have an impact on the upcoming race.\n\nOnce you reviewed the info of each racer, you can now see the circuit on wich they will be running. You can bribe the referee or place traps on the circuit (that you have to buy). Then, you can try to sabotage/enhance some concurrents, by offering them ""gifts"".\n\nFinally, just before the race begins, you have to place the odds on each racer. If it's not interesting enough, not a lot of people will place bet. You'll have to leverage your previous mischiefs to gain money. People will bet because they like a contestant, or just because it seems the more likely to win.  Be careful in your actions, because the more you try to influence the race, the more there is a chance the trust in the race fell, and less people place bets.\n\nThe moment the race takes place, you're mostly a spectator, crossing fingers for your plan to succeed.\n\nI like the idea so much I've started working on it."
n7kdm5,Superhero Game idea,"Hey everyone, I’m new here and this idea is one that’s been on my mind for a minute. A game where you are placed in a random area, as a character from that world. You can have different ways/opportunities to find out a super power and become a superhero. grow from a rookie hero to a powerful cosmic superhero. There would be villains for each tier of hero who all have different agendas and schemes. I realize that this idea would take a lot of effort and but it would be fun."
n7joyx,"If you were to create a Pokémon, what would you focus on?","I’m not sure it makes sense but I’m debating whether aesthetics take priority over (competitive) usefulness . I am creating my project and while developing I am at a crossroads of design philosophy to take.\n\nWhat would you recommend? I’m curious to kind of see how everyone would Armchair CEO?\n\n\nPersonally having played Pokémon for the competition, anything and everything will have tiers (Top to worst). However why create a bunch of different creatures (and thus risk getting dud designs) when I can say, hit a bunch of archetypes? But I am not a fool and know that Pokémon didn’t become the cultural giant without the aesthetics. Not to gush, some designs are the best of the best. Instantly recognizable to a large majority of the population. So this kind of puts me at a crossroads"

n7fbuf,a game idea i had that i wish was a real game," ok so i wish there was a star wars game like cod (call of duty) where you would be able to customize you blasters and armor and skill traits and there are different eras you can play as also instead of zombies it could be invasion where it is a droids or pirates,etc and for multiplayer it is like battlefront but it is clones vs droid or rebels vs storm troopers and there would be different game modes and there was different eras in star wars history where its not just battles there is a story line in the campaign and there is depth to the star wars fps games"
ngjkvj,Some help with characters with my story interactive fighting game,"Due to covid, me and a few people had to stop working on this game idea, but trying to get back on track with it. It was very slow for the past few months, so hopefully all goes well.\n\nThis project is focuses on horror/sci-fi and dark fantasy elements.\n\nBetween the character choices, which ones seem like the best idea?\n\nA snake/gorgon like creature created experiment? Or a female reptilian humanoid fighter experiment that is similar to the predator?\n\nA viking frost giant that controls ice? Or a slender tall ice creature that resembles a wendigo monster?\n\nA supernatural firefighter consumed with fire?

nggymw,Endless runner game idea,Hi I'm new to game development. I wanna create my first game. I have an rough idea abt using accelerometer for navigation instead of swipe. Plz suggest me some themes for this.
nge2dx,Skin of our teeth,"sorry if this was mentioned before. I love zombies and roguelikes but don't have the time to actually learn all the skills to create my own. will lend my voice to whoever decides to make this thing though.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nZombie low poly co-op fps roguelike. PermaDeath, Item unlocks. Characters to unlock. Very gritty/dark atmosphere. Ambient sounds/music. Randomly Generated building layout. Multiple building types as the levels. An apartment complex, Hospital, Asylum, Prison, any big building that would be easy to generate randomly. Keep weapons simple but plentiful. No bosses but zombies react to the amount of noise made. Has to be a headshot to kill. possible body dismemberment to help slow down if no ammo/low ammo. Zombies can grab. if grabbed you have a chance to escape once. if grabbed near multiple zombies instant death. No revives when dead. Maps are chosen at random. able to barricade doors using furniture to cover flanks. NO UI being a one-hit death. Ammo check is in-game animation. no mini-map. a journal you can pull out to read notes that can be found. the journal can be used to also check found equipment. Escaping the building alive leads to the next area. Friendly Fire always on.\n\nTLDR (think RE SURVIVOR but as an actual FPS/roguelike with co-op)"
ngbrq2,My prediction for the next big hit (it most likely isn't). Please add your ideas.,"In my humble opinion, I think If someone could create a game that's simple, and easily-modded. It needs to be multiplayer, I suppose among us perfected the formula in terms of lobby size (10). Make it heavily rely on communication. That way the gameplay changes depending on the players. Procedural content would be awesome; If you have anything to add, please feel free to post a comment :)"
ng8bhs,An aim trainer for console,"I mean... there’s literally no competition on the market at all. I don’t know how to make games for anything I just feel like this would be easy money. Anyone that’s wants to train their aim would only have one choice, which would be your game."
ng88c7,Cannibal Islands!,"Hey everyone, this is my first post about an Idea I had a few days ago. \n\nI will post my story and my thought process in the end, so you guys can read why you are here. \n\nImagine the following: \n\nThere are two relatively close Islands in a tropical environment. Both Islands are inhabited by the  indigenous tribes. Lets call them Rubys and Sapphires. Both tribes live on their respective island and try to find food, water and shelter. Life is hard on these Islands, but it is manageable. Especially when you work together with the rest of your tribe. \n\nThe real threat is coming from the other tribe. Every now and then Rubys and Sapphires are crossing the border and invade the other tribe. The are not trying to steal food, or special items or something.\n\nRubys and Sapphires are invading the other Island to Hunt, Kill and Eat the other tribe! \n\nDoing so will make your character mutate into a better form. How the food is prepared will change the effect on you.\n\nIf you eat it raw, it will make you super strong. Making you strong enough to charge through walls and buildings and being able to take down whole villages by yourself.\n\nCooking the meat on a fire will unlock your  cognitive abilities. Crafting some weapons, or a better fireplace, or some defensive structures. \n\n(Here is some extra room for people eating something like rotten meat, or special parts of the body or something like this. Maybe they will have better night vision, or can hear bare footsteps way ahead of all the others.)\n\nYou need to eat quite some Meat for the mutation to kick in, but your advantages are massive. Also the effect will fade away if you cannot provide more meat for you mutation. So without more food, you will turn into your normal, basic form after time.\n\nThis will be a survival Game with a little twist. Instead of players just wandering around and killing everything that moves just for the lols, they have to work as a team to reach the goal of being the dominant tribe and reaching the 100% Mutation.\n\nThis Idea was inspired by the survival Game ""The Isle"" or to be more specific This Video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cj7JzmEf-\_c&amp;t=1836s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cj7JzmEf-_c&amp;t=1836s) made by SovietWomble. Survival games have been pretty much the same for the last 10 years. Its either DayZ, Minecraft, Rust (DayZ Epoch) or a BR like PUBG. And I try to change the format a little bit.\n\nWhat the game should be when it is finished:\n\n\- You choose Rubys or Sapphires\n\n\- You spawn somewhere on your island\n\n\- You need to find food, water and maybe some special fruits for your health\n\n\- In order to take your character into a better stage, you need to hunt, kill and eat the other team. \n\n\- The way you prepare and eat the meat will decide how the mutation changes. \n\n\- Your Tribe needs different kind of people, some Strong mutants, some smart mutants and whatever class you might think of.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThats the bare Idea behind the game i made up and might never come to live.\n\nThanks for reading :)"
ng6byd,Spark of Life,"The game starts where you're basically looking forward, and can't turn your head. You're being driven through a storm. There's a bright flash, and everything goes dark. Your vision returns slowly, like a static ridden TV. You look around to see the truck you were on driving out of view, and a few robots and parts scattered around you. This is where the game begins.\n\nYou're a robot given autonomy by a bolt of lightning. You need to find refuge, but as a very rare anomaly, you will be hunted by the humans wherever you go, as soon as they figure out you're alive. You can pass yourself off as lifeless by never turning your head, and moving at the same time. This will work for a some time.\n\nYou need to find information on a rumored autonomous underground where humans and robots live as equals. You get this info by scavenging, and asking humans that are sympathetic to your plight. Remember, robots don't ask questions like this. If the human isn't friendly, it will out you immediately. If you manage to kill humans, they might drop anything from money to batteries (for energy using parts, not you), keycards, or possibly info you need to progress.\n\nAs the only autonomous robot you're aware of, that makes others controlled by the humans hunting you. They are almost all your enemies, until you start getting closer to the underground. Destroying robots, and anything electronic drops parts, some useful upgrades and new abilities, some totally pointless, or aesthetic. The stronger you are, the easier you get noticed... but the easier you'll survive an encounter.\n\nLastly, you're a modern bot, made with modern materials. You can't rust. If you're heading into human populated areas, you're going to want to wash off the... uh... red stuff... Trust me, they'll notice..."

nfyjtb,Dangerous Streets (Redux),"Dangerous Streets was once a crappy Street Fighter rip-off in the 90's produced by an Italian studio mainly for the Amiga system (it's even included as a pack-in with the infamous Amiga CD-32). I noticed a very beautiful opportunity with it's main aesthetic, 90's Nightclubs.\n\nI believe it would be a great Killer Instinct-style game. Either based on the original arcade game or the 2016 Reboot. The nightclub scenery, combined with a house music soundtrack akin to Black Orchid's theme from the KI games, and the zaniest characters ever conceived for fighting games. It surely is a lively and nostalgic experience!"
nfv30x,Open world character collecting fighting game," You collect and trade characters and maps. The maps are open world and fully explorable. The story is just to explain why they're all together, it's never fully explored. The character and maps are all stored on the cards and the game itself is mostly to display the information stored on the cards so that you can continue to add more maps and characters. I know this is an ambitious large game and gathering the rights to so many characters is nothing but a dream.\n\nStory\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe story begins by opening to a few characters acting normal before vanishing.\n\nFor example, superman is protecting a city and vanishes while holding a car, then it\n\nopens to few other characters and ends the same way. After we see this 2 or 3 times we see a shot\n\nof a large group of characters all confused, maybe some from the same series next to each other, \n\nfor example, Ben 10 can stand next to ben 10 omniverse who booth appear as they do in the show.\n\nThis isn't limited to heroes but villains as well. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe then hear a loud demand for silence and the screen pans to several extremely strong\n\nvillains who have been the cause for cross-over stories in the past, or just has god-like powers.\n\nFor example ""teen titans"" and ""teen titans go"" Trigon was the result of their worlds colliding, \n\nand Bill cipher from ""Gravity Falls"" just has god-like powers. They will explain that everyone\n\nthere is for an ultimate test of strength. No one will permanently die from the damage they recieve\n\nand can go all out. Some are also shrunk (specific massive characters like kaiju and giant robots)\n\nfor a fair assessment. Their worlds are all on pause and no one will remember anything when it's all\n\nover with. If you want to leave, fight. Characters all poof into arenas across from another opponent and begin to battle\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCards\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe back of each card says has the games logo in the art style of whatever series\n\nthe character is from. The characters art takes up half of the card, full NAME displayed\n\nin the middle, for example, Spidermans will say ""peter parker"" or ""mile morales""\n\ndepending on who they are, And in the corner a symbol indicating what type of fighter it \n\nis, and under the name is a brief backstory description. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBattle field cards are sideways to show off more art, an indicator in the corner for how large the field is, and a name on top. The unique aspect with battlefield cards some stand-alone\n\nand don't have fighting counterparts. For example, the Simpsons doesn't have any characters that can really fight, but Springfield can be an entire map.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ngameplay\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMovesets\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou can freely edit your character's move set to how you want to play. Every character will have move set already picked, but in the character editor you can find even more moves\n\nnot yet active AND you can freely place them on any button. For example, if you so chose you can set ""up"" and ""down"" to attack and ""left"" and ""right"" as ""jump"" and ""down"". Every character is limited to what their continuity has access to. For example, young Ben 10 can NOT be goop. The only type of characters limited to this are ""collectors"" such as Chaotic, or pokemon.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinals\n\nHow finals are used is totally dependant on the character's lore and they are also swappable.\n\nSome abilities need to charge before use, some can be used right away, some are a massive \n\nfinal attack, some are a form change that's either permanent or brief (add character examples later)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIntroductions\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow your character shows up is very dependant on lore. For example code Lyoko characters would reconstruct above the ground, superman would fly in, sailor moon would transform. And after\n\nthe character does their unique intro above them is their title in the series art style.\n\nFor example above peter parker is ""Spider-Man"" and characters with more than 1 title leaves\n\nit up to the player. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCostumes\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll costumes are unlocked right away for owner's customization. Characters who have different\n\nart styles seasons or games but are essentially the same exact characters have their own costumes.\n\nFor example ""American Dragon"" has 2 styles each being their own costume, and Mario has various costumes\n\nacross games all with their own representation such as 8bit or tanuki Mario.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMaps\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBuilding and object in maps are destroyable and even have obstacles or enemies and you have the option to turn off all 3. Map size various and can even be restrictive. For example a large city or a tight enclosed building.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nelements\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFire, cold, and wet will affect some characters more than others. If a character doesn't do well in the cold\n\nit may take more damage in a cold map, if a character is made of fire it will take more damage when another uses a water attack. This is minimal though\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nclasses\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is just a character classification for how they fight to give the player an idea before using it. Players\n\ncan build a preference for class and collect specific players that better fit their fighting style.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDiverse- A diverse player doesn't have the option to change out movsets, but instead characters. Chaotic, pokemon trainers or even single characters like ben 10 will have various characters to choose from. You can swap them mid-battle and their movesets are all pre-set. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStealth- stealth characters may not be very good hand to hand. Characters like Aiden Pierce can use gadgets to fight from afar or trick other players. Stealth characters can deal a lot of damage, but also take a lot of damage fast. Some can go as far as to turn invisible, but that can also be countered by other moves/gadgets or even finals. \n\nWarrior- Warrior characters have very few long-range attacks. Most of their attacks are either various close-range weapons/attacks or very weak and minimum choice of long-range attacks such as arrows. For example, Link from the legend of zelda will have bombs, a bow and arrow, and various other long-range attacks, but he deals more damage up close with hammers and swords. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShooter- Shooters have very minimum close-range attacks but will always have a very wide arsenal of long-range weapons. They also have the option of being played in the first or third person. Critical attacks are also a unique ability that lets them hit characters in the head for extra damage, but the downside is if the opponent's attacks happen to hit you in the head it is also extra damage. The character plays like a typical shooter and the move set is to swap out weapons.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSpellcaster- Spellcasters use various spells either to boost their own abilities, attack, or defend. A lot of their attacks have hot, cold, or wet after effects, and spellcasters can be closed or long-range attacks. For example, Natsu from ""fairy tail"" has plenty of fire-breathing attacks, but also boosts his own punches and can attack up close. The only downside is their attacks are usually slow as they have to announce or read them. For example, Natsu has to yell ""FIRE DRAGON-"" as he inhales and shouts ""ROAR"" as he attacks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRPG- These characters are intended to be played around with. They have various close and long-ranged attacks that its hard to guess how they're built. For example, DragonBorn can come out with bows, weapons, or spells. There will be a choice to choose whether to boost the characters rang, spells, or close-range attacks and a few costumes that represent each type, but doesn't not have to match the boost."
nfuczq,Game Ideas,"Guys it has been a week of constantly searching for ways to get new ideas and play new game, but I can't think of any good idea. I am seeing how all those people in this reddit's section are coming up with fantastic ideas. Someone even got an idea from a mere DREAM tf. Could you guys please advice me on what to do?"
nftll5,Ghost and a victim. Need help to expand my story.,"Ok tittle is not good. But this is my first time of creating some text based adventure game. I had a little idea of game. There were 2 characters ``ghost`` and ``victim/target/boy``\n\n if we play as a ghost our main goal will be to make stay victim/boy, i thought there will be some kind time in which before that time ghost doesn't have a much power to directly kill him or maybe ghost can't do that. The victim/boy will hardly try to get out of there by making some tricky conversation but we need to make him stay anyhow. For ex if he ask for a glass of water and if we go to kitchen he will will run way or something like that and we will lose. \n\nAnd if we play as a boy we play as reverse. Story begin as like this we woke up on a unknown house. We don't how and why we came there and we found there is a lady on a house whose is trying to kill us. Later on we found that there is a time. We need to escape ahead of that time cause she will become more powerful and we will have less time to escape.\n\nSo later on i thought it will be difficult to make character choose able. That's why i need to make only one character playable. I don't know which should i make. I need help of creating some interesting story. Not that much complex cuz before this i had never wrote a story game.\n\nHere i need a story which tells how and why the boy came or we went there, what is the time on which before that time ghost can't kill us or we can't kill. Story need to explain why is that happens.\n\nThat's my basic idea for this game. I know it's ridiculous but this is first game story. It will be just a text adventure game not any graphics."

nffooq,A fighting game where you try to pull off the flashiest moves possible,"Quick question: would any of you play a fighting game in which you try to pull off the flashiest moves possible to win? This idea came to me from some games I've been playing recently: Sunset overdrive and the first injustice game. So why not combine the two? After all, you can never make something completely original, but you can always make something fresh."
nfef16,A 'Cthulu' In Space.," GAME IDEA #4,915.\n\nYou and your motley crew of flesh clumps (maybe 5 others) are stranded on a water planet that has one spaceport connected to one city on the only landmass on the entire world.\n\nYou are heavily armed, and heavily armored, with gadgets on top of gadgets that you can spread out and use amongst yourselves to support one and another.\n\nThe Goal - Gather Parts you need that are spread out across the landmass and City, hidden in areas that need power, security authorization and perhaps some climbing to get into, so you can escape what is happening.  But things break, and bullets are scarce.  Rearming is few and far between and replacing your armor is also slim.  There is no -food- or -drink- meter, but there are Environmental effects, like Radiation and Fire that you will have to contend with.  Thankfully clubs and items of the stability kind don’t shatter like your some blonde mute starring at a broken sword after three wacks, so melee is a viable defense against your foes.\n\nAlso, the Foe(s) you should avoid or fight as sparingly as possible?  Lovecraftian Horrors in the form of two factions, the Old Ones and the Elder Things who are waging a ceaseless bloody war against each other with swarms of lesser critters that rip each other apart to hulking nightmares that could take a small nuke to the face and you would only clear its sinuses.  Neither side takes notice of you and your gang of shooty-bang-bangs unless you are the only ones left in the area or make yourself into a threat they would have to contend with.\n\nThere is no diplomacy.  No communications.  No Rhyme or Reason for what they do.  You and your lot are in a Battleground of Maddening Things that are Blood Drunk for little else other than Slaughter.  They are fighting a war that has Consumed Stars and Shattered Worlds.  All you and those screaming ninnies on your Discord can do is Escape.  Because you can fight all you want, they never stop coming, and they will hound after you until they are dead, or you are.\n\nThe Mechanics would be a sci-fi, 3rd person shooter on an open world, wherein you customize your rambling bag of bones and squishy bits.  You can shoot, stab, and swear vehemently at the twisted husks we call ‘bad guys' in order to win.  You not only have to defend your only means of escape, but you have to set out and seek resources (bullets, med-kits, and go-go-juice or fuel if you want to be pedantic).  Every location is different, and what you need is randomly placed throughout the City.  You die, you lose equipment, resources, and time, spawning back on the ship like a newborn babe, though you get clothes, and don’t have to worry about missing mom at elementary school, or those awkward teen years.\n\nOver time, (and completing a certain threshold of repairs) the presence of said ‘bad guys’ escalated, making forays into the City more difficult than before. The Two AI's are engaging each other like a Real-Time Strategy Game, dispatching units to secure objectives only they could conceive in the effort to remove all other opposition from the map, which is the enemy AI and then YOU in that order.  You, technically, don't want either side to win, instead, you are looking to escape by repairing a down starship and evacuating the Planet because there is no rescue coming.  No one knows what in the name of Bob the Builder is going on, so yeah, you are it.\n\nHowever, as you progress and slay Old Ones and Elder Things, they will start to take notice of you and send forces out to hunt you down and harass the downed spaceship.  Edging the War in Favor of the OTHER side to keep it balanced will keep both sides focusing on the other.  You can do that edging by shooting, stabbing, or sabotaging one side or the other, you just don’t want to garner too much attention in the process.\n\nYou also don't want either side to win completely, not before you are ready to go.  Because once one side has shoved their enemy off the World?  They will be free to wreak full havoc on anything left, and some of those Hulking Nightmares cannot be killed by MORTAL means.\n\nThat anything is YOU, and you are VERY Mortal.\n\nRandomizing objectives for the player, as well as adding lore pieces and exotic weapon types and peppering them across the map would entice players to replay the game.\n\nAlso having a combat system that would allow those crazed, psychotic maniacs who like to hold the line against huge waves of lesser enemies with little more than a dane axe and a colorful vocabulary would help as well.\n\n(NOTE - I have Lore written for this somewhere, I swear.)"
nfdab8,Ranged Tank,"Some of you will agree, some disagree, but mostly this post is here so maybe someone can use it as an inspiration or to discuss this topic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI, personally, don't find the concept of a ranged tank that hard. Instead of keeping the enmy close and soak up all the damage while the DPS picks 'em off and the healer keeps everyone alive, the ranged tank would keep the mob at bay while the DPS picks 'em off, or anyone that comes through, while the healer keeps everyone alive.\n\nThe damage soaking part comes in with big mobs and/or enemies with ranged attacks.\n\nI imagine them as short- to mid-range, with focus on AoEs, stun- and knock-back attacks. The ranged tank would have to stack buffs for more powerful attacks to keep the enemy at range as long as possible. The attacks are fast enough to keep multible enemies at bay, but slow enough for it to be challenging. Of course, this type of tank would be way less mobile than DPS or even healers.\n\nSuch a tank could be a battle mage with powerful ranged attacks and shield spells, or just some person who ripped a Balliste straight off the wheels and wields it BFG-9000 style.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThoughts?"
nfd8k0,Political RPG,"I'm sure this has been done before by like Paradox or similar. RPG where you create a charachter, with stats and skills, and gather stuff/level up etc, except instead of the focus being on fighting, 100% of the interactions have to do with politics.\n\nLike, you start out as a councilor in some small town. Your quests have to do with proposing rules and getting people to vote for your legislation. When you level up, you move on to being a politician in a higher tier, until eventually you're the president/prime minister/ emporer.\n\nThe skills would all be very gamified, and the stats would have something to do with your appeal to different people with different ideologies. There would be some simple procedural quests and a main quest line that is scripted. Individual ""encounters"" would be stuff like meetings with lobbyists, votes, town meetings, etc.\n\nYou can get NPCs to join your ""party"", and in this case it is literally your political party. Probably the main view would be a map with encounters occurring in little models of parliament halls, town council buildings, etc."
nfcw6y,Mortal Engines,"This movie gave me a neat and outlandish game idea.  \n\nYou start off in the bleak and open world as a very small campsite attached to a tracked vehicle.  You're quite quick but you have very little in the way of defenses.  You must keep mobile in this world because of the hostile world around you\n\nThe world is full of minerals and materials that you need to mine to grow your city.  Mining minerals and resources helps you to upgrade various components on your vehicle. \n\nYou can upgrade:\n\n- mining equipment to mine faster\n\n- engine to move faster\n\n- different chassis to build different platform (tracked wheels, arachnid legs, hovercraft, all have pros/cons)\n\n- defense systems (shields, laser defense) \n\n- offensive systems: a harpoon that allows you to skillshot and hook other players to slow them down, an auger that allows you to ""mine"" other playercities to absorb them in a very violent manner. This is the urgot experience.  General weaponry\n\n- surveillance - air balloons, primitive planes, etc to observe the world around you (find resources, find other players, etc)\n\n\n\nThe bigger you get, the bulkier you are and generally slower you are. You also become a primary target for enemy players larger than you.\n\n\nThere would be various playstyles available-  pirate/mercenary who strictly hunts other playercities,  fast and small cities who are able to mine smaller patches quickly,  large lumbering giants with very strong defense systems but would need to stay near large resources to sustain themselves.\n\n\nResources are used to repair and refuel your city. If you run out of fuel you can't move and become a target - you'll have to downsize your playercity by selling components you've built to move.\n\nIf you die you start over.\n\n\nYou can build outposts and temporary structures that offer various benefit, but due to the violent world these are rarely permanent and are often destroyed.  The native life on this world are slow tremors-style worms that will attack structures and cities that remain still for too long. \n\n\n\nBalance wise, you start off small with little resources. you're quick and evasive so you stand a chance at surviving but also generally you would not offer a lot of resources for enemy players who would be looking to harvest you."

You can customize your character to look like anything."
nexeju,Cooperative Vehicular Combat Game where the tracks do circles around giant bosses.,"[](/gottagofast)Sometimes I have weird dreams. Sometimes those weird dreams make for good game ideas.\n\nSo for this particular fever dream I envisioned a multiplayer boss battle arena where players were all in go-kart like vehicles armed with a variety of weapons. The goal was to kill the boss at the center of the track. Players had to alternate between driving like madmen to get out of the range of attacks to doing high flying stunts to hit high-up weak points to unloading their stored power into the boss' back while their attention was elsewhere.\n\nThis concept could also be expanded to tracks where you race alongside the boss like the ending of Jax andd Daxter 3. Also you could have another player be the boss of asymmetrical PvP.\n\nDrivers could gain temporary damage multipliers by driving through boost rings or doing tricks, so fast and skillful driving resulted in higher DPS. Vehicles had pretty tight handling compared to most driving games so they could quickly face their vehicle towards the boss and unload with front-facing weapons instead of their weaker multi-directional ones. Vehicles also had jumps and hovers to make use of vertical layers of tracks and to get themselves off of damaging floors.\n\nGenerally being in front of the boss is dangerous so one player could try to distract them while the others shoot them from behind. Bosses could also summon minions or create traps that would have to be dealt with so the track didn't get too cluttered.\n\nAccording to my subconscious this game was Sonic Baobao, a Japanese arcade exclusive that was later emulated and took the internet by storm. So you might want to look at procuring the rights from SEGA for maximum authenticity to my dream."

newug8,Need help coming up with a good name,"I'm making a game, but I'm having trouble coming up with a name for the main character. The main character is a slime who starts off really weak and can barely move but he strives to become the pinnacle of strength. Any ideas would help."
new5qe,Player Quest: A World Run By Players,"Excuse this for being really long, I just had a lot of ideas. Also if there's a game similar to this please tell me because I would like to play it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\nIn the world of Player Quest, everything is run by the players. The player can fully customize their character to look however they want, there could be different races idk if you want you can add that I guess. Every player starts off in The Hub, a city and commonplace protected by city guards, in the center of the world. There they are given their training and then set off into the world to explore dungeons, fight bandits, and forge their name in history. Each player is given standard gear and a memory shard, which allows them to view visions of the past in dungeons.\n\nPlayers gain a reputation from the King and Queen by completing quests. The more reputation you have the cheaper items will be to buy from NPCs and you can sell items for a higher price to them too, but only for NPCs. This obviously grants you more reputation to buy better gear, new pets, mounts, or homes/bases.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Visually**\n\nVisually I'm not picturing this game to be realistic. I think something more cartoonish and outlandish would work great for this. The environment, NPCs, dungeons, and enemies can all be really unique. I'm feeling like something like Breath of the Wild or Wind Waker type of cartoonish graphics would work well for this game. Idk that's just how I would make the game.\n\n**Fast Travel**\n\nThere is a very limited fast travel system. To fast travel you must sacrifice an item you are currently holding, and the value of that item depends on the distance you are fast traveling. For example, if you want to fast-travel to a nearby location you would give up something minor like a healing potion or something. But if you want to fast-travel halfway across the map you would have to give up a much more valuable item. The reason for fast travel is that the wilds are very dangerous. You have the environment that can kill you but also other players. And once you die you respawn on your own and you have to go and get your loot back, hoping that another player didn’t take it. This is why it's important to gather loot so that when you die you equip yourself and try and find your stuff as quickly as possible.\n\n**Questing**\n\nOne of the first quests you can get is to explore a dungeon and recover a lost relic, but things are more complicated than that. Dungeons restart occasionally, probably every day, and they are open to the public so there is a chance that another player has already gone into the dungeon and taken the relic. If you’re early enough, you can get to the dungeon first but you’ll have to survive all of the traps and things within which can be very dangerous. Once you reach the end of the dungeon and the relic is gone you can use your memory shard to see the player that took it, identifying them. You now have a chance to hunt them down before they return the item and return it yourself.\n\nThere is also the chance of someone stealing that relic from the NPC. If someone steals it you can take a bounty quest which would give you the identity of the thief. It won’t give you the location of the thief but if you go near them the game will notify you and you can kill them. The reason to steal it is if you can hold onto that item for a duration of time you can sell it for triple or 10x the price or whatever. But that time duration is only if you are playing the game, so if you log off that timer stops, and the timer stops if you enter a dungeon or a base or something like that; you have to spend that duration in the wilds which isn't that bad since the fast travel is limited so you’ll probably be walking or traveling to the next locations anyways. Once you steal the item the timer begins. You don’t know who the bounty hunter players are so you’ll have to be very careful with avoiding and surviving them. Also, all bounty hunters are competing against each other, so just because one player kills the thief doesn’t mean you can’t kill that bounty hunter, take the relic from them, and return it. The bounty hunter quest ends once the item is returned or the thief survives. The thief is also unable to return the item. Once the thief’s timer runs out they can sell the item for the increased price or just store it for later in their home.\n\n**Housing**\n\nWhen the game begins each player is given a room at an inn. In this room, you have a single chest that you can store a very limited number of items in. Players can also put decorations and stuff too. Later on, you can buy houses and even land out in the wilds to build your forts and stuff. Each home is its own area so you would have to load into it. If you purchase a piece of land in the wild a player approaching that land will be notified that they are entering someone’s land and if they want to travel to the location, if they say no then they’ll just keep exploring. \n\nBut anyone can break into your home. You can’t just buy any area in the wild, there are specific locations all throughout the map that you can buy. But since you have to load into your home other people can buy that plot of land too. When you go to that plot or home it will give you the option to enter your home or enter other players’ and it will give you a list of all the other players that own that plot or home and you can enter them and try to break in and stuff. But when you are offline they are not allowed to break into your home. Players can only break into the homes of players currently online. If you are breaking into someone’s house and they log off then you get 10 seconds to grab as much as you can before you get kicked out. During that time guards will also be twice as powerful.\n\nBut you have to be careful because anyone can purchase hounds or guards and defenses to protect their stuff. If someone tries to break into your home and they’re caught you get notified and you have the option to fast travel to your home and hunt them down. But you cannot fast-travel to your home at any other time without giving up an item. When someone gets caught and you kill them, you aren’t allowed to open any chests or anything. If they stole anything and you stopped them then all those items go back to the chests they were last in. You can loot their body and once you get everything you can from them you can dispose of it and anything you didn’t take gets thrown away forever.\n\n**Guilds**\n\nPlayers can also create their own guilds, at any level. Each guild is private and the guild leader can accept any players they want. When a player applies to a guild their relationship with other guilds and members within the guild their applying is shown to the guild leader so that they can decide whether they should be accepted or not. So like if someone is trying to apply but they have really bad beef with another guild or a bigger one, you can decline them out of fear of being attacked. Or if they have or had beef with a current guild member you can discuss it with that guild member and then determine.\n\n**Enemies**\n\nEnemies follow the ESO style where they level up with the player. So an enemy will be as difficult for a level 1 as a level 100.\n\n**Dungeons**\n\nAny player can create their own dungeon using a separate dungeon-making app or something. To create it you must first pick a prize which you will give up. So if you want the reward to be 10,000 reputations you must give up that much of your own. This is relevant since other players will be more inclined to play player-made dungeons with better rewards, which would benefit you more (as discussed later).\n\nWhen creating a dungeon you can pick how many players are needed for it, the max is 8. You can create your own traps, mazes, use whatever enemies, have parkour, literally whatever you want. Every week, player-made dungeons get open to the public and you have a 1-week timespan. During that time span, players can play your dungeons and rate them at the end. The rating is a “like” or “dislike”. At the end of the week the game will tally up your score and it'll rate it out of 5 stars and if you get anything less than 3 stars then your dungeon gets removed and you basically lose your hard work and effort. But for every “like” that you get you receive the amount of reputation at your level; so if you are level 10 you will receive 512 reputations for every “like.” At the end of every week, the top 3 player dungeons get special rewards. Every week there will be new player dungeons and there will be random weeks where popular dungeons are opened. There will probably be like 12 or something dungeons that change every week but if there aren’t 12 player dungeons to choose from then randomly generated ones appear which allow the bounty quests, but otherwise the bounty quests don’t apply.\n\n**Leveling**\n\nLeveling is based on your reputation. Each player starts at level one with 0 reputations. Each level increases the reputation requirement by 2. So level 1 starts off with 1 reputation required, level 2 needs 2, level 3 needs 4, level 4 needs 6, etc. The max level is 100. You gain reputation by completing quests. Quests are given by NPCs or Quest Boards found through the map. The quests can be completing a dungeon, getting a relic, killing a certain number of enemies, or gathering resources or something. These aren’t things you necessarily focus on but you end up achieving as you're playing. You gain reputation by just killing enemies and selling things. The amount of reputation you get from defeating enemies, gathering resources, and completing dungeons depend on your level. So if you are level 5 you would get 16 reputations from those actions. You get double your level in reputation for completing quests. So if you are level 5 you would get 32 reputations for completing quests.\n\nYou also earn reputation points from selling things. There are 5 rankings to items: Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, and Legendary. Every 5 levels the amount of reputation per item sold increases. So between levels, to  1-5 Common items will give you 1 reputation, uncommon 2, rare 3, epic 4, legendary 5. When you are level 15-20 common items sold give you 3, uncommon gives you 6, rarely gives you 9, epic gives you 12, and legendary gives you 15.\n\n**Skills**\n\nThere are many different skill branches within the game and each time you level up you gain an increase in the branches most used. When you level up you also get an increase in Health, Stamina, and Magicka, but you also get an extra point increase you can put into any of those three. You level up skills by using that skill. So if you want to increase your skill in archery you have to use a bow.\n\nBut it is your reputation that is really important. The higher your reputation the better quests you get with better rewards. NPC shops will also be cheaper and will provide you with higher-level items to purchase. Certain homes and plots also aren’t purchasable without a certain level of reputation. But you can also lose your reputation. The currency in this game is reputation. So when you purchase something you pay with reputation. You won’t go down a level, you’ll stay at your current level, but to level up you’ll have to regain all that reputation you just spent and then level up to your current level. Getting killed causes you to lose 25% of your current reputation. So if you are level 3 you need 4 reputations to level up so you’ll lose 1 reputation. But that percentage is determined by the level that your reputation is at, not your level. So if you buy something with a ton of reputation and your reputation goes down a couple of levels, the amount you lose is 25% of the level you went down to, not the level you are actually at.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Random Extra**\n\nReaching max level will probably be pretty difficult so when a player does it they are commemorated by having a statue of them be added into the game in The Hub. You can create up to 3 players.\n\nIf you have any questions please ask and I’ll try to answer them. Thank you for reading!"

neti1y,Keteru yamiko,This is first game i have ever thought so please feel  free to  give criticism and help me. \n\nThis game is mainly inspired by SCP 835 - JP\n\nThis is a horror game that has  every realistic features and it's set in a  huge lab not a foundation one where a group of players have to avoid being killed by yamiko. The total amount should be 12 players for a game. Just like FNAF or among us the players have tasks to complete for example changing water checking in on equipment and listening or reading yamiko manga  and anime. The reason you have to read the Manga or the anime it's because if you are the last one to not complete this task you are the first target  she will be looking to kill. There also a catch if you read the Manga too much you will also still be our first Target. The first stage of the game is basically doing test the second stage is avoiding try not to be killed as a side note only the person that does not read the Manga first gets killed everyone else who has read the Manga will not encounter her and vice versa if you read the Manga too much since one of the mechanics is to reread it multiple times. The third stage is Task and investigation is still continue to do your task at the same time you have to do a investigation on the death of the players. Keep in mind the deceased player is muted and everyone is muted during the task stage but there is a group chat. when the player is being stalked their chat becomes unusable to the targeted  player between stage there's something like Among Us where you can do a group call or group meeting to give the evidence that you found in present your case and vote  players out or lockdown in a cell. Another side note due to the fact that player locked in they will be the one that  get killed during the next stage with another player. By the  fourth stage if all players are dead or it is one remaining the game is lost. To win the game you have to at least find out that it was a SCP by gather enough evidence to prove it and calling the foundation. This is where the bonus stage comes in for the both winners and losers. The game now becomes more of a first-person to third-person shooter smilier to battlefield  and rainbow six siege the  objective of the mission is to rescue the one player that was remaining that's now NPC and capture the SCP for those who lose. For those  who won main task is retrieve data and capture the  SCP. At the end of for the winners there's a little cutscene or a continuation of the stage where you're trying to deliver the SCP but there is mysterious beat up old rusty police car chasing you too be continue for a dlc. \n\nThis game is made for PC and gaming consoles

You need more people and greater or more advanced buildings in time to boost your thinking efficiency. \n\nIt is a city builder but unlike other city builder you can, next to thinking, build your own buildings with a tool kit (like in planet zoo or planet coaster). The tool kit you expand with the thinking mechanic. Unlock a saw to create a sawmill and gather planks. With the planks you can build a planked wood wall. If somebody though about that. This should create organic and individual city development through the ages.\n\nIf people don't work they can think. Maybe they can go to a school or university to think better. \n\nI think you can imagin the game."
nelgyd,"A Multiplay SPC Game, But with a twist!","So here’s what I’m thinking: this will be an 8 v 8 v 1 multiplayer game pitting the SCP Foundation against the Illuminati, with an escaped SCP hunting both groups and interfering with whatever mission they undertake.\n\nThat’s the main loop of this game: each map will have a unique objective pertaining to either “Containment” for the Foundation or “Breaching” for the Illuminati. For example, the Foundation is working to retrieve several active SCPs from an abandoned shopping mall while the Illuminati are working to stop them and keep the instances active at all times, with The Plague Doctor roaming around trying to “cure” both sides."
nek0u1,Ideas For My New Game,"I have been working on a new game, or at least planning. I need some inspiration. It is going to be a 3D Open World RPG, sort of like Genshin Impact but instead of anime looking characters it will be cartoony looking characters. I also want to implement some building mechanics and a whole ton of items and weapons, aswell as different heroes, pvp and a campaign. I just need ideas and a way to organize this game. Feel free to message me or leave some ideas, and of course I will credit the ideas if they manage to get into the official game."
nejavh,I've had this idea for a while now ...,"For a few weeks I've had in the back of my mind a game idea. It is set in a dystopian country that has been at war for some time. You play as someone who is a part of the military and is becoming disaffected with the world you live in. You are picked to test a new piece of equipment to help win the war: an armoured suit. The protagonist gets in the suit through its back and starts to learn the basics (the tutorial). During this process some kind of disaster happens resulting in an explosion and you have the opportunity to escape with this new piece of tech. You get to a nearby town and to safety but realise that the back of the suit has been damaged thus meaning you are stuck in the suit. This is the crutch of the game, you have 3 days to live before succumbing to dehydration and as the days progress the functions of your suit fail and you become weaker. The campaign is divided into these three days and you can unlock perk points that allow you to pick functions that you want to keep and will force you to specialise your play style. Your overall objective is to free the town and nearby area of the presence of the authoritarian government and fight off any forces they send in."

ndvwik,From Mook to Villian Game Text RGP/Interactive Novel,"Pretty much what it says on the tin: the character starts off as a garden-variety mook (Star Wars stormtrooper, fantasy orc, security-guard-for-evil-cyberpunk-corporation, a low-level bureaucrat in an authoritarian government, whatever) and works their way up the Ladder of Evil, defeating or misdirecting heroes, allying with or backstabbing comrades, and generally Kicking the Dog to become the Big Bad themselves, or at least the Big Bad's top henchperson.\n\nWhile I'd love to make this a full-blown Fallout/Skyrim/Red Dead Redemption-type RPG, that's probably a bit too ambious. The basic mechanic would be a text-based or point-and-click story game, but with weapons/supplies/MacGuffins inventory and personal attributes (strength, stealth, health, intelligence, magic? horror?). Having top-down maps would be cool for certain situations (see a few paragraphs down). Inspirations include:\n\n* [Fallen London](https://www.failbettergames.com/fallen-london/)\n* [Sunless Skies](https://www.failbettergames.com/sunless-skies/)\n* [Tyranny](https://www.paradoxplaza.com/tyranny/TYTY01GSK-MASTER.html)\n* [Beholder](https://beholder-game.com/)\n* [Suzerain](https://www.suzeraingame.com/)\n* [Eighty Days](https://www.inklestudios.com/80days/)\n* [Heaven's Vault](https://www.inklestudios.com/heavensvault/)\n\nYour character can pick different career paths (magician, spy, thief, thug, military officer, etc.), whatever will give them a leg up in the dog-eat-dog world of villainy.\n\nYour character can align with various factions within the evil army/government/business they work for, or be secretly working for another villainous faction outside the organization, or even (gasp!) spying for the good guys. They can also go out (setting permitting) and spy on the good guys, possibly even sabotaging their operations or giving bad advice.\n\nWith that basic concept said, here's a couple of rambling, optional ideas, in no particular order:\n\nI don't really know what the best combat system would be: perhaps just a skill check or a bunch of options (charge, dodge, shoot, etc., depending on the setting), with success depending on the character's stats.\n\nThe character could also be a more verbal type, using flattery, rumors, and so on to misdirect enemies into your literal or metaphorical traps. For example, the villainous mook character you play attempts to misdirect a hero (the type of character you'd usually play in a video game) to assassinate the wrong target or steal the wrong MacGuffin. This could be by pretending to be a ""quest-giving"" character or by setting traps, blocking doors, messing with the ""signpost"" clues, stealing the MacGuffin themselves and escaping, and so on.\n\nThese ""misdirection"" parts of the game could be just textual choices like the rest of the game or they could be top-down 2D maps that allow you to move through and mess with the map as the hero you're fighting goes charging through. Imagine if you were playing Dishonored or some other action game, but one of the ordinary-looking guards anticipated you showing up and messed up the level design and/or your mission goals in the first place. Maybe that's too much for a simple text RPG, but I thought I'd throw it out there.\n\nOf course, it being an evil protagonist game, your character is also cozying up to various other ambitious villains, running errands, choosing factions, and looking for an opportunity to backstab. Perhaps you'd also have a reputation stat or multiple faction reputation stats, which you can fill up by pleasing your current boss or your boss's rivals to earn promotions.\n\nThe game ends when you reach the top...or if you get killed or expelled for your ambition.\n\nPlease let me know your ideas!"
ndsyad,Inspiration,I am working in Unreal Engine and I am looking for a game idea. It's my first game so I want it to be smallish but I want to be able to post it on steam as well. I dont want to create anything specific I just know I want it to be a 3D game.
ndrf4y,What really is there to do in space?,"So, there are two types of space games I can think of right now: flight simulators and colony builders. This post is exclusively about the latter.\n\nWith the flight-simulator kind of space game, what you do in space is pretty obvious: you're the pilot, and you fly around and shoot things, and there's various ships, asteroids, stations, and other obstacles to shoot at and fly around.\n\nFor builder-type games, you're in charge of a crew and you can obviously build things like expand your ship, place equipment, manufacture stuff, and maybe fight off enemies in a vaguely X-COM-style way. The view is some kind of cross-section, either top down or isometric.\n\nThe game I want to make is based a bit more in hard sci-fi and I'm trying to keep that in mind, though we'll see how long that lasts 😀\n\nTo clarify my issue I want to talk about a couple other games first. First game is [Starship Theory](https://store.steampowered.com/app/574760/Starship_Theory/), which despite the reviews \_is\_ fun for about 10 hours. You start out on a tiny ship and can use a mining laser to choose asteroids, gather materials, and build out new hull and flooring for your ship. However, other than building up more resource-generating equipment (e.g. solar panels), accumulating resources, and placing items, there's not much to \_do\_. There's a continuous stream of events: asteroid fields, friendly trading ships, hostile warships. And you fly too close to suns sometimes. Normally, the way games are paced (e.g. Rimworld, or any game), it's maybe 70% downtime and maybe 30% do-or-die-oh-shit-we're-being-attacked. This game is 100% ""there's an event happening right now"", and it's always one of those 3 events.\n\nAnother (more finished) game is [Space Haven](https://store.steampowered.com/app/979110/Space_Haven/). This one is for sure more rounded out, and has similar ""collect resources, expand your ship"" mechanics, but as you can see from the [screenshots](https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/979110/ss_ef63e55182d8068e762d3824ab52a569df12ae4d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1620996077) it eventually turns into a build-an-entire-supply-chain-in-space simulator. You could \_buy\_ microchips, but why do that when you can research and build up a dozen different fabrication devices and build them from scratch? /s There's of course a fair bit more content like mining and breaking down derelict ships, all the while being chased by pirates to keep you from lingering in one place for too long, but the core building mechanic is just building up tons of factories to convert resources into different types of resources.\n\nMy issue with Starship Theory is that the crew just sits on their consoles until they're hungry, thirsty, or tired, and then eats, drinks, or naps (hey, a little like real life?). Space Haven is maybe 75% building factories and resource management.\n\nThe game I want to make, as mentioned earlier, aims to be SLIGHTLY realistic:  \n\* You can't just float outside in an EVA suit and expand the hull on your ship. You need to be at a station to modify your hull.  \n\* Not building an entire supply chain on a small spacecraft.  \n\* Not fielding a continuous stream of severe events\n\nBut then if you're not building a manufacturing line, and you have proper downtime between random events, what is the player (and crew) actually doing?\n\nIs your reaction reading this ""Yes, that's space games for ya"", or is there something more interesting someone could build in this genre?"
ndrdxr,"Lintu, Survival of the birds","The title may be changed.\n\nIdea: a survival game where you either play as a bird or can change into a bird.\n\npreferably with terrain that compliments the ability to fly, and not necessarily earthly.\n\nfor inspiration for the flight and transform mechanic you could look up a cancelled project called Vind"
ndoqk5,Game based off Hypixel Bedwars,"So something I noticed was that Minecraft servers have some games that are similar to some very popular games.\n\nI mean there’s Minecraft hunger games and a bunch of battle royale games which were incredibly popular for a while.\n\nThere’s minecraft murder mystery and there’s among us which are basically the same games.\n\nThere’s also a bunch of capture the flag type games in Minecraft which is a popular game mode in many popular games.\n\nI mean all these popular Minecraft mini games tend to have popular real game counterparts. And since bedwars is one of the most popular games in the most popular Minecraft server, and is actually an interesting and fun concept, I’d say if someone were to make a quality game that’s similar to bedwars, it has potential to blow the hell up.\n\nIt’s also the type of game where many youtubers can make content from especially if they add a bunch of variant game modes. I mean of course as usual, whether it succeeds depends on all kinds of stuff other games need to succeed, such as the visuals, gameplay, controls etc.\n\nBut I think such a game would have a higher chance than others, simply cuz it’s already a well known and fun concept that’s only existed as a mini game.\n\nSo as long as someone makes it right, I feel like it could blow the hell up."

ndhpkz,Autochess genre variants,"With the success of tactical shooters, I'd like to see a Valorant autochess.  Instead of the pieces battling in a normal autochess manner, they attempt to plant/defuse a bomb each round.

Pretty sure I don't have to explain that one, but I feel like it could be fun.  :D"
nd8bsz,A base building survival game set on a sleeper ship.,"I might try this, but it isn't fully fleshed out. I've been reading a bunch of hard sci fi set on ""slow"" interstellar ships. Think big spaceships full of frozen people that are thawed out 100, 1000 or 10000 years later after they reach their decremated. The thing that interests me is: what happens on these space ship's when things go wrong? Does someone have to wake up and do maintenance? Are there robots?\n\nIn this game you would play either as the ship's AI, or as one (or several) crewmates. The goal would be to reach the destination without the colonists dying or the ship getting destroyed. I was imagining that mostly this is a building and resource management game. You start with resources that you can use to build your ship. \n\nThe ship is constructed of modules and is viewed in a top down way. Each module has equipment in it that has inputs and outputs (say, heat electricity, oxygen, co2, proteins, etc.) And your goal is to construct the ship so that it is in homeostasis.\n\nAfter a long time, the homeostasis breaks down, and modules have to be repaired, replaced, or rearranged.\n\nThe way this would work, I imagine, is that you have ""sleeping"" and ""waking"" cycles. When you're asleep, the game cycles through years rapidly and simulates the breakdown of the ship, and maybe throws in some randomly generated ""crises"" like a meteroid impact. When something starts to go wrong, the player is ""woken up"" and has to check out the ship's status, the levels of all the inputs and outputs, and then rearranges modules, breaks modules down and recreates modules as needed.\n\nThere could be some resources that take 1000s of years to come to fruition, like a forest module that generates wood, or a compost module that breaks down dead organics into methane. So you could wake up to harvest those resources.\n\nI think the major challenge in this game would be making the emergent effects balanced enough to be a challenge while also not being impossible. Showing the player what the full state of the system is might also be pretty hard."
nd2rcp,Upside down camera rotation for an FPS/TPS combat drone game.,"(I think I'm flairing this as mechanic, since the all the further concepts are designed around this mechanic.)\n\nSpellbreak is a TPS with lots of vertical movement, so a common ""issue"" is that it becomes hard to aim an enemy directly above or below you due to how cameras in FPS games normally work. The default FPS camera works so that you have infinite yaw rotation (horizontal rotation) but where pitch is limited to 90 degrees up and down from the horizontal level.\n\nThis isn't really a fix to that problem, that's just how the idea came to my mind: So, I thought, wouldn't it be funny if you could rotate your camera OVER that top/bottom limit and do an actual flip, going upside down? Basically, this would double the range of possible camera positions, the new positions being otherwise equivalent but where the camera is upside down. This also provides infinitely looping pitch (vertical) rotation.\n\nNote that this is NOT the same as going upside down in flight simulators, where there's no preference relative to world axis and where turning pitch and yaw will cause roll. In my idea the horizontal rotation would still happen around the top and bottom ""poles"" like in FPS games, and therefore the camera is still defined around this up/down axis and there's no roll, and sideways is always sideways. It's just that now for every possible direction the camera can be facing, it can be either upright or upside down (or, literally ""on the flipside"").\n\nThe logical choice for what the player character considering the camera system is a combat drone/(quad)copter, for which being able to flip over and fly on either side makes sense. [Bad, quick, basic drone design](https://files.catbox.moe/qnu2ew.png) From this point on, an endless number of possibilities rush into my mind.\n\n---\n\nThis kind of game would create whole new skills compared to traditional FPS games\n\n- Choosing flip side situationally with potential sacrifice in awareness: You could have different set of abilities available based on which side you are flipped on. Strengths, weaknesses and synergies could depend on which side you are on, or depending or whether you or your enemy are on the same or different ""polarity""\n\n- Ability to flip and keep track on enemy: To flip, you need to turn 180 degrees horizontally and 180 degrees vertically. Both can be executed towards either direction theoretically without ever lifting your mouse from the pad given enough sensitivity, since there's no top/bottom limiter to change the relative mouse position when gone against it.\n\n- Navigation ability, to not get disoriented while flipping and being able to comprehend the battlefield on both flip sides.\n\n- New manuever possibilities, like circling around an enemy vertically. While this is technically a thing in flight sims, it's different due to free mouse aim and top/bottom poles.\n\nMap and gravity possibilities: All of these should ultimately be wider horizontally than vertically, since aiming sideways is still better than straight up/down.\n\n- Traditional map on earth surface with gravity.\n\n- A map within an open space, with floating obstacles and points of interest approximately on the middle plane. Could have no gravity, or gravity towards the middle plane, or away from the middle plane.\n\n- A flat, two-sided ground surface surrounded by sky or space on both sides, with holes to go to other side, or if it's a smaller disk, you might have to go around the edge to get on the other side. Gravity is towards ground plane. Team bases are on opposite sides of the disk. \n\n- A map with sky sandwiched by two grounds on opposite sides (floors/roofs). Gravity is towards both floors and switches in the middle point, abruptly or gradually becoming zero-g in the middle. Team bases would be on opposite grounds and also at some distance horizontally.\n\n- The definition on which flip side you are on could either be set in stone for a map, or be determined by the direction of gravitational field you are in. Or it could be determined by the side of your base, meaning that opposing teams potentially have the opposite favorable side.\n\nAdditional game ideas:\n\n- HUD features and color change to indicate which side you are on, normal side or flipside. For example, your crosshair could change from this /+\  to this \\+/. Also, show a border across top and bottom poles and/or or color tint on the side you are not on, to indicate when you are about to flip sides.\n\n- Different unit types that vary in speed, properties and abilities, different classes. Some heavy classes could have limited turning rate, with a free aim being limited to a square that slowly adjusts towards the crosshair. The meat of the game however, is focused on drones with FPS-like free aim and mobility for extremely fast-paced 3D dogfighting.\n\n- Ability to land ground and horizontal surfaces. Available abilities and unit properties could depend on which flip side you land on (which will also determine whether you are attached to ground or ""roof"" visually). You might be able to travel on ground with wheels or in a humanoid form, or it could be a static mount on a surface, where your drone transforms into a temporary turret which could provide things like vastly increased defense and firepower. Your unit type could have limitations on which side it can land on at all.\n\n- Some unit type could flip using an ability, by doing a quick 180 roll, so that you don't need to manually flip (by turning 180 horizontally and vertically), though this should be a specialty, not a norm.\n\n- On most unit types, levitation thrusters would be omnidirectional and automatically point towards ground/gravity, but a special unit type could have thrusters work only towards one side, limiting the time you can spend flipped upside down before you crash down. The advantages for flipping then would be greater. This would result in some high risk high reward aerial acrobatics to maximize combat potential. This could even be a whole unit category."

ncsi7w,AI for enemies being attracted to a player whistling,"I dont know anything about AI at all, but I'm gonna start diving into it soon though, because I'm trying to make a game in Dreams on Ps4, and I want to have some stealth in it.\n\nLike I said, I know nothing about it, so I dont even know if I'm thinking about it in the right way, but it seems like it could work to me. Idk.\n\nSo, here's what I was thinking. Let me know if it makes sense or not. Its \n\n- When one enemy hears your whistle, 2/3 of the time they will casually stroll over to check it out. This sets them up for easy stealth kills.\n\n- 1/3 of the time they will draw their gun and become suspicious, making the takedown more challenging. \n\n- If they are suspicious, there is a 1/3 chance that they would say, ""Hey, I heard something,"" alerting any enemies within a certain distance. \n\n- The alerted will then turn and watch while the other investigates. \n\n- If two or more enemies hear your whistle, they will each react independently. So, two might be calm, while one is suspicious, or they're all suspicious, or all calm, etc. They will each have the 1 in 3 chance.\n\n- If three or more enemies hear your whistle, they will always only send two men.\n\n- If your cover is ever blown, or if enemies discover a dead body or something, they will be suspicious of every whistle from then on out.\n\nDoes that make sense? And is it insanely difficult to do?"
ncq9j8,WW2 choice based game,"I was thinking about an idea of a call of duty game based around ww2, its a choice game like telltale but the choices arnt button presses, they are things that change as you play it differently.\n\nIf you remember the 2nd or 3rd cod game (id remember which one it is) but in that campaign, your able to pick a variation of countries and fight with them in cod fashion. I feel like in this game, you can pick different countries from ww2 and play with them in a story, but your actions can change the campaign and or cross over different place you might have seen playing another side. Basically its choice based like telltale, but centered around player action not a selection of 4 choices, based in ww2 with interesting plot and historical areas across the world such as moscow, Leningrad, berlin, you get the picture\n\nIdk give me your thoughts 😁"
ncoxiu,Money Down: A Battle Royale where money is on the line every round.,"Now, I know this idea is basically dead in the water because cheaters would probably ruin it but anyway...\n\nI would like to see a battle royale in line with something like PUBG but each round requires putting money down to buy into the round. \n\nThe ante money is in-game credits that would be purchased through a store and could also be spent on cosmetics. Once you have credits in your account you queue up for the level of ante you want. I'm thinking the equivalent of $1 or $5. \n\nAs far as pay outs my first though is something like, bottom half loses their ante, top half at least breaks even, top 10 at least doubles, third makes 3x, second 4x, and first 5x. The house take the balance and is the primary way the game makes money. Credits won from rounds can be pulled out once you get to a minimum value so if you make money from playing well. \n\nEven if you couldn't get a full lobby of 100 people into a 5 dollar game on a Tuesday night, having money down would even make a 10 person battle royale round intense as long as the circles and loot were appropriately balanced. \n\nI think the money on the line aspect would also make it popular for streamers. Twitch account integration could let people bet their credits on the contestants."
nclo6f,How to increase the creativity of the game developer?,"Throughout my 20 years working with art, I have always found myself in the need to seek new sources of inspiration, whether for a personal or professional job. One of the best ways to increase your creativity is to collect images and references from other artists on a daily basis. Every year I create a reference folder on my computer, collect everything I like and that can inspire me in future projects. The first page of your browser must be a portal for artists' works, that is, there is no escape, daily I am bombarded with images and magnificent works, which only contribute to my creativity and perfectionism.\n\nOne of the websites I recommend is ArtStation and CGSociety, both of which are an excellent source of inspiration. \n\nI believe that this is the minimum. Watching movies, being extremely curious, playing different types of games, drawing, writing a story, watching documentaries about the universe, mysteries, in short, all this contributes to having more and more references in our minds. Get inspired and use your creativity to create new projects."
ncl2e3,CS:GO case simulator but for Pokémon cards,
ncj2vq,College Simulator,"Genre: Roguelite/Roguelike deck builder with cartoon themed students (you) and professors (enemies)\n\nCore loop: Card battle against a bunch of professors to pass their classes and graduate from university. If you fail against any professor, you lose the game. Each fight is a specific number of rounds and then you get a final grade; 60% or higher to pass on easy mode. 70% or higher to pass on hard.\n\nResources themed as ""energy"", ""comprehension"" (and possibly more). Use abilities to fight professors who throw tests and homework at you. Professors have different grading schemes and tests/homework assignments that have varying negative effects, like ""Pop Quiz"" that can be blocked by a high enough comprehension level (like Armor), or ""Bad Lecture"" which subtracts your comprehension level.\n\nSome professors are notoriously difficult. Others are a cakewalk. Some come with TAs?\n\nGo through four ""worlds"" themed school years. You fight 12 professors for 4 years and then graduate with a GPA. Choose which classes to take.\n\nYou would have abilities like ""Crunch night: -2 energy, +2 comprehension, -2 energy next round"" or ""Illicit Drugs: +1 comprehension when any Study ability is used"""

ncbn3f,Not sure if something like this exists already?,So my girlfriend and I were talking about what our dream games would be. She loves games she can just turn off her brain and play but i think my dream game would go something like this. Its set in feudal Asia like dynasty warriors (i love the aesthetic dont judge me) but its an open world game with quests and fantasy monsters and magic items/weapons/rituals that fit the setting like the elder scrolls universe with the build your empire mechanics of fallout 4. Basically taking my favorite parts from some of my favorite games and putting them together. Again its just a dream game and im not sure if something like this already exists?

ncagfl,Sea of thieves except Star Wars,"Sorry for bad grammar and bad spelling \n\nOk so the concept of the game is almost like sea of thieves except in space like a Star Wars Version of it. The game would be set days after the battle of Jakku. This would mean the empire is all but destroyed there are still parts of it floating around space but for the most part it’s gone. \n\nSo My idea is we would split the mechanics in games like sea of thieves, red dead redemption and No Mans Sky. What I would  want to take from no mans sky would be there ship mechanics and there space exploration stuff but scale it down a bunch so you have like 2-3 different systems with 1-2 planes in it.\n\nThe Red Dead Redemption part would be taken from there. Honour system. You could ether be good or bad if your bad you would work for people like Jaba the hut or other groups like that. If you’re good you would work for the new republic doing bounties and other missions. Now let’s say you want to make a switch from the new republic to the hut clan, to do that there would be a very special mission for you to complete. What I was thinking for that mission is Raiding a ship that belonged to the empire. The ship is still active and is trying to restart the empire but you come to stop it, this is how you would convert from a bad guy working for the Hut clan to someone in the new republic. \n\nThe Sea of thieves part is pretty self explanatory but there could be a whole variety of missions for someone to do depending on what honour you are. If you work for the Hut Clan you could be doing hit jobs or running spice. If you were on the new republic you would do things like bounty hunting or find officers who were apart of the empire.\n \nOne last thing to mention would be how you would maneuver around space. In sea of thieves everyone is given the choice between three different ships with different numbers of crew mates aloud on. This game would completely change that. The ships customization would be depending on how you play. If you play alone then you might want more speed on your ship because you might now be able to control the turrets the best alone. If you play with your mates you might want a ships that built for combat. What I just listed was the customization inside the ships but what about the actual ship you can purchase. What I’m thinking is this, for the two sides of honour there would be different types of ships, each having there desirable attributes compared to the other.\n\nAnyways this is my idea for a game. Personally I think this would be a fun game that would make you feel like your now apart of the Star Wars universe. Sorry for making You read a bunch of grammar mistakes and spelling mistakes."
nc6sri,Brass bones,"I know rule 6 states that anyone can use my idea but I'm looking to develop this one myself, I'm just looking for feedback.\n\nProcedural Rogue-lite with PS1 style graphics and a steampunk theme. Titanfall style mobility with a few dozen unique weapon types. Here are a few examples:\n\n* Arc-rifle: Fires multiple short-range lightning bolts that chain to nearby enemies on hit.\n* Ramper: Machine pistol that fires faster the longer the trigger is held. The magazine is inserted through the top like an M1 Garand. Ping included.\n* Gibstick: Charge-up railgun that obliterates enemies.\n\nEach weapon will have three perks that are randomly generated. Here are a few examples:\n\n* Wormhole Accelerator: (For projectile weapons) Simply teleports the bullet into the enemy. Less damage due to some quantum wormhole magic.\n* Recall Beacon: On precision hit, return the next three shots to the magazine. These recalled bullets lose some velocity.\n* Cheese Grater: Bullets are split into multiple short-range versions of themselves. Must be a strong cheese grater.\n\nI'm still debating whether or not to have these perks physically appear on the gun due to it being a colossal amount of work. As stated in the Recall Beacon, some weapons will have elemental properties. These do nothing by themselves but when combined... for example, if an enemy is coated in tar then hit by fire, they will combust. If an enemy is coated in water, then hit with ice, they freeze, temporarily stunning them.\n\nThe lore consists of you being a worker robot that was accidentally left with their consciousness when they got thrown away. Every time you die, your AI is transferred into a new robot. You start in a hub area called, fittingly, 'The Junkyard'. Upon dying, you can choose a new frame to 'possess'. I'm planning on adding three classes but aren't super sure with the specifics yet. I know I'll have one mobile frame, another more tanky frame, and another specialist that's maybe more of a hacker that can 'tame' enemies?\n\nAt some point in your runs, you'll unlock the permanent aspect. The upgrade booth which for some reason is sentient. You'll get cogs from defeating bosses which you can then use to either upgrade health, speed, or damage. Every three upgrades in each category introduces a new mechanic such as grenades, slow motion, or even b-hopping.\n\nPlease, please give me feedback as it is greatly appreciated. I hope you liked my idea and maybe even buy it someday!"

nc5lru,An intuitive way to handle walking through and interacting with doors.,"There's really not much too it. It may have already been done before. I dont know. It seems like the perfect way to handle them. \n\n- Say you're on Ps4, basically, if you hold square at a closed door, the player character will walk through and close it behind them, in one fluid animation. If the door's already open, the player will walk theough and close the door behind them.\n\n- If you quickly press square instead, the character will only open it. Same goes for closing it. Pretty much like every other game. \n\nSeems like this would be great for both immersion/realism, or if enemies are chasing you. \n\nIn real life if I go through a door and close it behind me, it pretty much feels like one continues motion. In video games its four: Open, walk through, turn, and close. All with a small pause in between. Something that feels so second nature in real life, should not be so difficult in a game. It seems like this would finally make handling doors feel very natural.\n\nHas any game ever done this?"

nc30g6,Random game stat i thought about in FPS competitive games,"i was thinking if the stat of distance between the player and the enemy they kill, then getting the average determined by each kill they get would be an interesting thing to see \n\nfor example, there are 2 people with similar scores in a 5v5 game of csgo (can be applied to the likes of R6, Valorant, etv) lets say guy #1 is 20/11/7, and guy #2 is 19/5/2 in the rounds they played were 15 at half time. if each kill were to be a calculated distance for the kill shot then each kill being averaged and displayed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* determines if you're a long range shooter/entry fragger (first contact) with the ak for example or someone who kills in close range/holding angles \n* of course every kill is going to be a mixture of both in game play but im focusing on the frequency and how often kills like these occur and what scenario/gameplay style you play as discussed in the comment above\n\nbut yeah thats just an idea that i expanded on from a random thought and found this page to share, any feedback is welcomed."
nc2nuv,1-Hub 4-Portal Random Map Diablo without respawn,"A diablo-like game where you start in a town/hub like world with 4 portals to other worlds. You can visit them in any order you like. Each world behind a portal is a random generated map with a certain theme and monsters. You must find some keys, activate some switches and then beat the map's boss. Your goal is to visit all 4 maps and kill the bosses, to unlock the  final boss of the game that will appear in the hub town. Each map takes about 10-15 minutes for an average player. The skill level of the monsters is balanced to your XP/skill-level.\n\nSo to beat the whole game will only take \~1 hour!\n\nThe clue: When you die...you must restart the whole game!\n\nI thought about a game that has a high rate of replaying, you can further make speedruns or play in larger coop groups where the game is over when only one player dies!"
nc2f7k,Plants Vs Zombies 2,"\[Insert idea for title involving number 2 pun like Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa\]\n\n^(Idea: Plants Vs Zombies Trwoo (Portmanteau of Two and True, as in this is the true sequel))\n\nI've always thought that og PvZ was so insanely well designed. It's a one in a million game. Looking at PvZ 2, I thought their approach lost too much of the original thematic and charm. I wanted to expand the game's mechanics with more plant-related stuff rather than put them of some kind of weird SF II campaign and have them do some weird electric stuff and wear &gt;!bdsm !&lt;gear.\n\nThe first idea I had in mind was the implementation of a four seasons theme. I was thinking that the player from last game has since founded a zombie-defense business, going from house-to-house, defending them from zombies. I couldn't decide whether the player should defend the same house through four seasons before moving on to the next or you defend a different house per season. In the end, I think the latter stays true to the original format and so let's go with that. Instead of Day/Night/Pool/Fog/Roof/Boss, we have Winter/Spring/Summer/Autumn/Halloween (Boss)/Winter/Boss.\n\nNext, I think it would be nice to have something like a rune system. That seems in nowadays. Basically, the Zen Garden is unlocked since the early part and has palpable effects in gameplay. If you go into the Zen Garden, there are three slots by the window and you're given a free sunflower plant when you first enter. If you put the sunflower by the window slot, then you have an extra sunflower giving you sun in-game. Other ideas are the ice-shroom, giving you free freezing every now and then; Cattail, you have one free homing cattail from the window; Blover, free blow-away of insects and balloons every now and then; etc.\n\nThen, going back to the seasons system, depending on the season, some plants are weakened or strengthened. For example, during the summer, freezing plants freeze for shorter but fire peas damage for three times instead of two times the normal pea damage, melon-pults are cheaper. During spring, sunflowers yield rate increases. During autumn, squash, pumpkin, and kernel pults recharge much quicker. In the winter, freeze plants are cheaper but torchwood creates an area around it where you can place normally non-winter plants. Additionally, the pool is frozen over and you need flower pots before you can plant on them. Since it is permanently frozen, there will be a lot of bobsleds going through there. Alternatively, we can make it defrost temporarily (like how you can push back fog temporarily in og) using jalapenos, but you will also sink all plants in that row. Using ice-shroom refreezes instantly.\n\nThere will also be new zombies, and they're introduced throughout the seasons. For example, in the spring there are hive-keepers. They bring harmful insects that fly ahead of them. To counter them, you'd need to place a pitcher plant near your plants or blow the insects away with blovers. Fume-shrooms can also attack the insects. In the summer, there are surfer dudes who run fast and carry surfboards over their heads. They protect a small area around them from overhead projectiles. So far, those have been my only ideas.\n\nI think it would also be fun to be able to deploy a small inflatable pool - a similar mechanic from BTD5 - where you can place water plants there.\n\nLast, but not the least, Crazy Dave is replaced by this Asian shop with an Asian merchant stereotype (not sure if that's offensive. if it is, let's just change that) which grants access to new types of Asian and tropical themed plants. For example, the pitcher plant, the snap dragon from current PvZ2, some kind of vine-themed plant, and more. Crazy Dave instead shows up at winter seasons as a Santa Claus cosplayer, bringing you random seed packets or other stuff.\n\nAnyway, that's about it. Just wanted to throw this out there. Ngl, I'm pretty disappointed at current PvZ2."
nc20wt,A Quiet Place: The Game,You're basically in a quiet place universe and the game/monsters can hear you making noise in real life
nc1qun,Space 4x/grand strategy that’s less gamey than stellaris,"This game idea influenced by stellaris, endless space and crusader kings\n\nWould use something similar to ES2’s gameplay affinities so that instead of just having different stats each empire would have unique rules/abilities.\n\nWould use a character-driven system like crusader kings to simulate internal politics. To make it more flexible you wouldn’t be playing as members of a dynasty.  Instead you would choose a vision (which could also influence available victory conditions) and your “heirs” would be other characters that are inspired to carry on that vision.  Sounds vague because it’s meant to fit into a variety of government types/cultures, some more alien than others.  If I called it a political party or faction or something it would force every alien race to be similar to humans in some way.\n\nVisions would include things like conquering part or all of the galaxy, brotherhood between all aliens, anything else you (or modders ) could think of.  Basically how I play crusader kings except it’s an actual gameplay mechanic instead of metagaming.\n\nInternal politics would consist of conflicts between different characters in your civilization and would serve as an anti-snowballing mechanic.  That way if you fall behind in the early game you can still catch up when the empire next door splits into 3.\n\nTl;dr a space strategy game that focuses less on perfect gameplay/snowballing/map painting and more on emergent storytelling/an ever-changing balance of power/creative ways to take over the galaxy."
nc1e3f,Kingdom Hearts MMORPG,"Overview\n\n\nConcept\n\n\nDescription\n\nThis is a hypothetical MMO taking place in the same world as Kingdom Hearts. It functions as an instance-based hunting game where players go through various environments doing platforming challenges, obstacle courses, and of course fighting enemies and bosses most with branching paths and collectables throughout. This game combines gameplay elements from across the series, including spin offs.\n\nInspirations\n\nThis game takes inspiration from Kingdom Hearts, Monster Hunter, Super Mario 3d World, Rayman 3, and Spyro.\n\nStory\n\n\nSetting\n\nThis story takes place in a realm beyond the one we know. In this realm, all of civilization is powered by magic, all magic is powered by emotions. In the days long past, magic was a scarce and volatile resource as a result of humanity’s diverse nature and the circumstances of daily life. One day, they discovered a way to harness a reliable and plentiful source of magic by creating worlds modeled after stories. However, if left unattended, these worlds would become corrupted and start producing a dangerous and uncontrollable magic that threatened all around it. As a result, young warriors with the power to summon Keyblades were sent into these worlds and rectify whatever was threatening their stability. This time, you were chosen.\n\nGameplay\n\n\nControls\n\n\nDualshock\n\nL Stick: Movement\nR Stick: Camera\nA: Attack\nB: Jump\nX: Block\nY: Reaction\nLB: Lock Target\nRB: Shotlock\nLT: Strike Commands\nRT: Magic Commands\nPad: Selection\n\nOverworld\n\n\nTraversal\n\nThe user can move throughout the world using various jumps, land and aerial maneuvers, and Special commands. The user must also take advantage of the environment to get to various points through the use of gimmicks and objects, some of which require a specific command to make use of. Some obstacles also can only be exceeded by using specific commands.\n\nBattle\n\nWith the Abilities equip between Missions, the user has diverse range of combat and traversal capabilities. The user can utilize basic attacks and combos using the Attack Input, these can be further supplemented by using combo finishers and mid-combo attacks through using the Block Input. Most direct attacks can be neutralized or even countered by either hitting them with an attack or with a Block Input. Shotlocks are precise projectile attacks that at their most basic launch many homing projectiles at multiple enemies, but there are variants. Shotlocks draw upon a FP, gained by hitting enemies with attacks, as their resource. Between Missions, the user can use the Command Board to fill slots that when using the corresponding input. Magic Commands utilize MP in the Player Character’s stockpile, and Strike Commands require a cooldown period after use. A Command Board for Items can be utilized by holding both inputs. By using the Selection Input, the user can exchange their Attack Input for things such as Special Commands, Summons, Limit Brakes, and Form Changes.\nSpecial Commands often involve things outside of battle such as manipulating certain gimmicks, objects, or the environment in a certain way, enabling the Player Character to traverse the environment in a new way, or to access areas not possible otherwise.\nSummons involve making a particular character from a particular world and utilizing their abilities as the users in exchange for all of the user’s MP.\nDatas are autonomous constructs of characters from each story unlocked through progression. Up to 2 can be used at any time.\n\nLimits are special high-damage attacks that can be used as a combo between the Player and a Data that modify their primary Attack, their Reaction Input, and end in a powerful Finisher. These take all of the user’s FPs.\n\nForm Changes are transformations specific to each keyblade that change the user’s primary abilities and current commands to specific unique ones, sometimes endowing them with unique passives.\n\nMultiplayer\n\nIf the Player engages the multiplayer lobby, they can create and join rooms where many players can gather. When one begins the “Prepping” phase of a Mission, up to 3 other players can join to assist them, however, Datas can’t be used while at least 2 are present. Players can use True Limits and True Finishers provided at least one has unlocked one.\n\nProgression\n\n\nLeveling\n\nIn this game, the Player Character themselves doesn’t level up, but the keyblades they use do. When a Keyblade levels up, the Player Character gains stat boosts, armor and accessory slots. Abilities and Commands unlocked can be equipped with any Keyblade.\n\nKeyblades\n\nThe Player starts with the Kingdom Key but can unlock more through progression. Depending on the Player’s equipped Abilities, they can even equip and/or use more than one Keyblade at once.\n\nMixing\n\nBy Mixing, the Player can create the most effective equipment, items, and stat upgrades. The Player can also Mix materials with their Commands to increase their efficiency relative to the Level and Stats.\n\nLists\n\n\nMission Structures\n\n\nCourse Missions\n\nThe Player must traverse an environment within a mission, defeating enemies along the way. The Player must complete various platforming challenges and puzzles as they go, often collecting items throughout.\n\nTask Missions\n\nThe Player must accomplish a specified task while staying within the guidelines presented such as a time limit, tagging specific targets, or gathering needed items. There is usually some manner of opposition the Player must mitigate throughout.\n\nArena Missions\n\nThe Player must defeat one or more teams of predetermined enemies. The consequences for failure aren’t as severe, but the task of doing so may be more difficult.\n\nGame Mission\n\nA Mission involving mechanics beyond standard gameplay. The Player’s reward is often scaled with their performance in the minigame.\n\nBoss Mission\n\nThe Player must defeat a specific high-powered enemy. These enemies do not appear in normal gameplay and as such offer unique rewards.\n\nKeyblades\n\n\nKingdom Key\n\nLv. 99 = 1000 Exp.\nStrength: 1 (x110%)\nMagic: 1\nAbility: Draw\n\nStrike Commands\n\n\nLv 5 Quick Blitz: Perform a jumping attack.\n\nLv. 10: Rising Strike: Smack enemies high into the air.\n\nLv. 15 Sliding Dash: Punish faraway enemies with a charging attack.\n\nLv. 20 Quick Raid: Throw the Keyblade at the enemy once.\n\nMagic Commands\n\n\nLv. 3 Fire: Launches a dart of flame at an enemy.\n\nLv. 8 Ice: Launches a shard of ice at an enemy.\n\nLv. 12 Thunder: Calls down a bolt of lightning on an enemy.\n\nLv. 18 Cure: Heals either the user or an ally.\n\nAbilities\n\n\nLv. 1 Jump: Press the Jump Input to leap into the air.\n\nLv. 23 Guard: Press the Input to raise the Keyblade for a brief moment to deflect enemy attacks from the front.\n\nLv. 2 Dodge Roll: Press the input while moving to temporarily become invulnerable to enemy attacks.\n\nLv. 28 Scan: View an enemy’s HP gauge during battle.\n\nLv. 32 Draw: Attract Prizes from a distance.\n\nMeteor Shower\n\nLv.  16 Lock onto multiple foes and launch small, star-like projectiles at targets in a volley.\n\nArms of Awakening\n\nLv. 21 Gain different attacks depending on the currently equipped weapon.

In Game Recommendation Series)(Depending on what ya do this could be Advanced instead of Intermediate)\n\nA 1 to 4-Player 3D Platformer w/ 4-Player Drop-In/ Drop-Out Local Split-Screen and maybe online multiplayer as well, along with potentially the ability to do both at same time would be cool\n\n(For example: by playing with one friend online and 2 other people on your coach at same time, or any other combination of online &amp; local Splitscreen multiplayer mixed together)\n\nBecause truth be told there have been many Singleplayer 3D Platformers and even quite a few Online Multiplayer Platformers but to my knowledge there aren't ANY 4-Player Splitscreen 3D Platformers except maybe Minecraft but that's more of a Sandbox-Survival kind of game and not a full blown 3D-Platformer\n\nSidenote:\n\nY'all can't tell me running around in a nonexistent Psychonauts Spin-Off 4-Player Local Splitscreen game fighting bad guys, or even for some of y'all with connections to the big guys in the industry, a Smash-Level Collab Super Mario Maker-Like Game but for creating your own 3D Platformer levels/ worlds/ campaigns and picking your own 3D Platformer character to play as against various enemies/ bosses/ worlds with all kinds of building pieces from different franchises wouldn't be pretty cool as well\n\nSo yeah a 4-Player 3D Platformer would be cool with a Realistic, Cartoon, Artsy, Japanese, or Anime look and your own choose of setting/ world/ characters/ enemies/ bosses/ etc etc\n\nHave fun and hope it came across well!!"
nbxxwx,A school shooter game,"Like Friday the 13th the game, one person has the chance to be the shooter, and the others have to be the students. Students have to survive and the shooter has to kill all of them. Students can search around the school for weapons or items to help them. The doors are boarded up (by the shooter) and have to find a way out. The police haven’t been called because the shooter killed the people in the office. oh yeah and it’s set in the 1960’s so that nobody has smart phones."
nbx2hr,Looking for ideas for a meta(inside of a computer type) horror game,"Hey! I’m a relatively experienced dev, but I’m not the best at coming up with ideas. I’m twiddling my thumbs thinking up with a new project, but I’ve got a semi-idea of what I want to do. I’m absolutely horrific at any type of art, so the game that I’m thinking of would be simulated on a computer screen. Like the player would be interacting with an 80s virtual desktop, clicking buttons, playing minigames, reading files, etc etc. \n\nRight now I have the idea that the player is maybe going through an old friends computer, when they realize there’s a virus on it. The virus is like a demon or something that is corrupting the computer, which leads to terrifying shenanigans. Technically, that wouldn’t be hard for me to do- I’ve actually made a game fairly similar to this concept, but just didn’t have enough ideas to make it fun. I think it could be cool though, so now I’m asking around for ideas lol. If anyone has a good head on their shoulders for horror games like this, mini games, or just have a story beat they think would be cool, I’d love to hear it !"
nl0uf3,Caitlyn Jenner Driving Sim,"You play the role of Caitlyn Jenner and you have to speed across the state of California to make it to speaking engagements, photo shoots and campaign meetings on time - all while killing as many pedestrians and other drivers as possible (bonus points for homeless people). Points can be used to upgrade your car (spikes, grenade launchers, etc.) and to pay for your family’s innumerable plastic surgeries."
nl0lze,"Kamaz - a realistic VR driving sim where you are a soviet army driver, delivering supplies to an isolated platoon over rough terrain in the Russian-Afgan war","So, as an intro, I've been listening to a [playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7LqrwVkBeoZmlENBNjrzBxbBzX8nq4ms) of soviet war songs I put together, and I came across a comment from a Sam Matthews in the comment section of [вперед КАМАЗ](https://youtu.be/ZB1ezt0r48w). I'm mostly just an ideas magpie, but I have thought of some expansions to his idea.\n\nin his own words, *""You are the driver of a KAMAZ truck and you must drive from hayratorma to Kabul. And while you are driving your truck becomes stuck, shot at, lost, dug in, engine problems, lost cargo, wounded people, road conflict, unusable roads... A 12-hour drive in a slow vehicle on a dangerous path that must deliver its cargo no matter what... maybe even a sleeping feature where the driver goes to sleep for the day and so the player can sleep or rest in real-time.""*\n\nThis, ladies, gents, and all of you in between, is simply a phenomenal idea.\n\nmy immediate thought was something tonally like the depressed love-child of Desert bus,, euro truck simulator, stalker, mud-runner/spintires, and a pinch of rimworld, and to go even further. a 4-day round trip to refresh and resupply a dug-in platoon in deepest Afganistan, where you sleep in real-time. after you set a wake-up and bedtime in the settings. I'm not a monster, although...\n\nmidnight life or death raids on your supply column interrupting that *would* make the IRL sleeping a bit less of a gimmick... and running to your truck to frantically start it up packing supplies up as you go, or to act as a runner to pass medical supplies and ammo to the troops defending the convoy would also be amazing. give the player some agency, but prevent the player from just picking up two aks and going full Rambo. you are just a driver after all. perhaps you have a weedy little Makarov and a spare mag. perhaps not. all I know is I think the player should be very fragile and the enemies amateurish, but vicious,  frightening, and a force to be reckoned with. The cover and thin armour of the KAMAZ will be your best friend\n\nAnd every morning, because you would have to travel by night (hopefully this would be accounted for in the self-set schedule as to not fuck with your circadian rhythm too much) you would wind down and sleep with a campfire and the other truckers, tankies, and the odd soldier. this is where stalker can be seen, as you unwind from a night of stressful driving with some interactive toys. perhaps a guitar playing soldier you could request songs from, a pack of fags with a limited number for the whole journey. A bottle of vodka will affect your driving the next day if you hit it too hard and piss of your superior, but might give you the chance to keep moving if you catch a bullet. a map on which you've got to contemplate the next leg of your journey. deciding on the quicker route through a ravine, or fording a river that might kill or beach your truck and so forth. A radio you could chat with the blokes you are trying to save on to keep the goal in perspective. and depending on the progress you made and the casualties you suffer, they disappear one by one from the fireside, and the people on the radio get more and more worried. you can see the fuel trucks get lighter and lighter, and the meds and rations get fewer and fewer. you lose all of them, the game doesn't even end. even having the platoon you are trying to save cannibalize the trucks for parts, or use support staff like you as soldiers, would fractionally increase their chances of holding their position and surviving.\n\nThis is where that pinch of rimworld comes in - this would be an experience designed to make you fail miserably, figuratively and literally. perhaps the framing device would be an old war veteran recounting his story to his grandkids, an unreliable narrator. a story of resilience and perseverance, of pointless loss and suffering and camaraderie, only for it to happen again the next week. it would tell a story through interactions with the rest of the crew, and through rock hard gameplay. anything could go wrong, and you would have to fix it, and if you aren't fast enough with fixing it people you know and like will die.\n\ndriving a big, heavy, loud, and slow truck through dark, squat forests, deep ambush friendly ravines, fields of slowly sinking flares and the occasional danger close airstrike or minefield with being able to do nothing but drive like a 20-ton bat out of hell in VR sounds like hell, and I love it. it could be so tense when absolutely nothing happened yesterday, but a tank was hit directly with an RPG right in front of you the day before. you would never know if it would be a flat tire next, or an RPG to your trusty KAMAZ.\n\nAs a side note, I could see two-player co-op being a thing too. If there were separate threats to life and limb for you and your co-driver, played by your friend or a random, then losing then could become part of the story too. they flag a stray bullet, but survive, you'd better hope there are enough meds to go around that night, or even enough to stabilize them during the journey. having someone to chat to while driving the lonely roads would be nice, but I'm not sure how that would work with the IRL sleeping mechanic or then fireside conversations\n\nif you wanted to go truly off the rails, you could introduce cosmic horror and channel the more subtle side of stalker. have the journey be a slow descent into madness, doggedly trying to outpace an unspeakable horror and a chill down your spine. random people could disappear from the fireside, have the other characters mourn them, and suddenly have them return like nothing was wrong. everyone has no idea what you're talking about - ""no, what? he's been there from the start. never left"". and they just stare at you for the rest of the night with cold, dead eyes. the map changes regularly, but the route doesn't. you could wake up somewhere completely different from where you stopped. you could hear non-existent battles, see non-human objects no one else could just beyond your headlights during a long drive. having the player second guess themselves for 3 of the four days would be a massive feat, but my god would it be good. this is completely my invention, this part, and I'm not sure if this would work at all with the setting or tone or gameplay loop, but I'm still quite proud of this.\n\n\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nlast stop folks. If I haven't bored you yet, then me going into the technical details defiantly will. read on at your own risk. thanks for coming to my ted talk.\n\n\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSpeaking more on the technical side, this is where mudrunner and spintires come in. The main mechanic would be driving, defiantly, so it would have to be highly detailed and polished. A simulation similar to what they did to create an incredibly hard challenge from the get-go. manual gear shifts, the clutch, perhaps a winch to help other vics that get stuck. support for driving wheels, sticks and pedals would be a must for immersion, [here's an example](https://www.amazon.com/PC-Driving-Degree-Vibration-Steering-Shifter/dp/B08MT6F3C9/ref=sr_1_4?dchild=1&amp;keywords=pc+steering+wheel+and+pedals+and+shifter&amp;qid=1621974639&amp;sr=8-4), but they would not be required. it would be a largely seated experience, so the user would only really need a VR headset if there was keyboard support implemented too. hopefully, that would expand the already rather small customer base.\n\nThe art style defiantly couldn't be low-poly, or simplistic. The tonal clash would be horrific, but I understand it's easier to make for solo indie devs, and I could see it working if you tried to match the depressive tone and didn't go too simplistic or oversimplified. speaking of simplicity, I don't think you could craft 48 straight hours of random events, difficult terrain, and scripted sequences without a AAA team or a spare decade, so it would have to be randomly generated. This could hurt the campfire scenes, but if you play your cards right this could be a benefit. You couldn't know when a character you really like would die, or when you would run out of spare wheels, or when the next attack would come. Could be basically plain sailing, or the journey from hell this would help keep the game as fresh as possible for the madmen who want to replay the damn thing.\n\nFor the campfire scenes, I'd prefer to avoid any sort of dialogue tree or end goal. They simply couldn't be randomly generated, because then every single character would lose any personality and purpose and the player couldn't really develop an attachment, but a fallout 4 style ""yes, yes, yes with sass, fuck you"" dialogue tree would also be really detrimental. it would have to be fiercely well written, and somewhat reactive to the player. something large, and seemingly bottomless like Disco Elysium's writing would be good. something not designed to be exhausted, but to be absorbed and engrossed in. Again, very difficult for indie solo devs, but worth it. because of the sheer amount of dialogue, I think voice acting would be the best idea. It would help the conversations flow between the player and the different NPCs, and prevent the player from getting hit with a wall of text. perhaps the conversation could continue without the player, but they could interject when they want more detail or want to make a quip of off the cuff remark. perhaps a system like [Façade's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fa%C3%A7ade_(video_game)). but I can see the player breaking it very easily, and ruining one of the game's core pillars - immersion.\n\nAll of this is basically a moonshot. This amount of content, dialogue, random events, high detail assets. terribly inefficient and impractical. but as a very famous man once remarked on moonshots, *""we do not do it because it is easy, but because it is hard.""* if one or two ideas here make it into the core principle, we could have our hands on a winner here. even if we have to scale the time involvement back, this could be an amazing experience."
nkylb8,"I started developing a game but want to know if the idea is worth going forward with, I also needed to create a survey for a school project, so I created a survey to get a better idea of what to do.","I hope this is ok to do, I just not sure where else to go.\n\nThe main idea of the game is the player walks through out the world to discover mythological creatures and unlock information about them.

nkxwhe,Discord logic! The game about everything as long as it’s related.,"\nHow to play: \n1: Decide turn order (preferably based on order of icons in call)\n2: The first player will post a random image of anything. The second will post another image, (within a given time frame), along with a caption as to why it’s related. This continues, but a relation can not be the same as a previous one.\n3: Keep playing until someone fails to meet all of these requirements. Then, the loser has to say (initial picture) is like (last) because (initial) is like (next) which is like (next) which is like (last).\n\nAdditional rules:\n1: Call outs. When you think a persons logic is fallible, or that it’s been mentioned before, then you say ‘call out’. If you can prove your call out with most people agreeing, then that person loses. If you don’t, then it moves to your turn and you have a shorter time to act. You also can’t call out a turn if one has gone after it.\n2: Muting. It is polite to mute yourself while it’s during a call out.\n\nOptional rules:\n1: Points. You can decide to use points instead of just an instant lose. You gain points by the amount of seconds left in your turn when you post. You can also earn points by calling someone out, and proving it. In this case, they do not automatically lose, and you get the points they would. If you fail to meet the time limit, then you would not fail but rather revive no points. Play this until a certain amount of points or rounds. The least amount is the loser, and we know what happens to them.\n2: Long game. Whenever someone would lose and end the game, instead, they lose and the rest keep playing (with each consecutive loss adding more and more onto the ‘this is like that’ pile). The winner will not have to go through the losing process."
nkwofr,Cool horror/puzzle game idea,"I got a great idea for a 2d horror/puzzle game.\n\nYou get a light and have to complete tasks to get to the next room. There would be 50 total rooms.\n\nThing is, to see you need to use the light but then creatures are attracted to you.\n\nWith the light off you cannot see but they will not be attracted to you. They cannot see you in the dark.\n\nThere would be a paranoia meter that scales the longer the light is off.\n\nYou would have a battery meter on your light that stops it from working. If your light stops, your paranoia meter goes up faster and you have to complete the level in complete darkness.\n\nYou can still interact and escape the room without a light but it's faster, and if you bump into a creature with the light off you will be chased by it.\n\nIf your paranoia meter goes to max you will scream, which will put your paranoia down 1/4, but it will alert the creatures to you.\n\nIf you are caught by a creature you have to restart the room. Some rooms will be long to raise the steaks of you being caught.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nAlso give me credit please if you make or build off my idea."
nkukdn,"Snowpiercer game (based on the series, not movie)","Hi all, \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPre-note: if anyone is a game dev and wants to use this idea, feel free! and consider me your first customer.   \n\n\nBasically, I would love to see a game based on the netflix series of snowpiercer. Copy rights etc asside here is my kinda basic idea.  \n\n\n**Intro:**\n\nThe game starts 4 revolutions after the series ""end"", with Layton's democratic experiment a success (or failure if you want to play dictator mode...Wilford Mode) there is a general election for a new leader of the train. (we're not sure where Wilford is exactly, but perhaps S3 if there is one can give us a little more story, or he's eventually killed by some means or other in game). You play the part of the newly elected leader, and it is up to you to decide how best to run the train from there on. All decisions regarding the status of the train come through you, and it's up to you to keep everyone as happy as possible \*insert obligitory RPG character customisation menu\*   \n\n\n**Responsibilities:**   \n*Resources:*\n\nFood:&gt;!\nAg-sec cars grow crops and livestock to feed the train. There is also supplimentary protien bar cars that can be converted to Ag-sec, but protein bar cars are a ""higher density"" food producer.!&lt;\n\nWater:\n\n&gt;!The world is a ball of ice, so melt the snow and that is right? Wrong, Snowpeircer has scoop intakes and water treatment plants to remove polutants from the water, but in thick ice drifts these scoops can break. They have to be retracted going through cities or high drift zones, and so water conservation is important. The treatment plants can also be broken causing more issues. Cars can be converted into storage tanks, but that may not always be the best choice. !&lt;\n\nEnergy:\n\n&gt;!No energy, no lights, no heat. Without enegery the train runs the risk of grinding to a halt, or a rebelion arrising again. some cars use more energy than others and can be turned off and on as needed. But rolling blackouts may be necessary on some stretches of track else risk stopping. !&lt;\n\nWarmth:\n\n&gt;!While energy and warmth are intrinsicly linked, heat can be lost in other ways even if you have surplus of energy. Breaches, every time the train slows, higher altitudes, couplings. If it's too cold passengers will freeze. Passengers can be relocated to tempory ""hot cars"" if power needs to be turned off to a section, but only temporarly, else they'll get frustrated and loose morale. !&lt;\n\nWeight:\n\n&gt;!If the train is too heavy if wont be able to get up some hills, will take more energy to speed up, will take longer to slow down, and may derail if coming into a corner too fast. Rather than the whole train having a single weight, I'd imaging a system by which each car's weight is modled. This means if you have one of the afformentioned water tanks at the very rear of the train, it may rip off of the car as you come into a corner too fast, but equally if that tank was at the front of the train it would be harder to push it uphill. !&lt;\n\nMorale\n\n&gt;!The people want to be heard. They can give side quests, such as solving a murder or assualt, or simply retrieving something from somewhere. Morale can also be affected by all of the above resource states. Track talk between passangers will give hints of what to do to improve morale without ever having to do side quests, but side quests are far more effiencient and boosting this morale. Other events like supply car joins, particular scenic routes, or the choice of train wide radio statio can also affect morale. !&lt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*The Train*\n\n&gt;!As train circles the globe there is the ""Main track"" (the one the train circulates on mostly) and some side tracks. The side tracks can be used for a variety of things, ejecting cars like we see in the series, or shortcuts to other parts of the map. However the sidings are way rougher terain than the main track, while shorter in length to get to a destination they will have steep hills, cliff drops, or rough track. These can degrade over time with each revolution and even more so when used (especially if used incorrectly) making them dangerous to traverse regularly. \nThe main track is relatively safe, however snow drifts and crumbling buildings can block the track.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!The train must stay in motion to generate energy (unlimited in duration but not density), and battery packs will drain if you stay at extra speed, go up hills, use the breaks downhills, or go too slow for too long. However, with a greowing population after reproductive rights were re-introduced your citizens will demand more power, making this ballancing act of being fast enough to keep up with energy demand, but slow enough to not derail harder as the game progresses, population growth is relatively realistic with birth rate. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!Cars can also be upgraded. Bigger battery banks, better motors, better brakes, more livable space, increased crop yeild etc. But these upgrades are rare, found on sidings on abandoned supply cars which can be linked to the back of the train to aquire. Obviously this gives you two options: take the siding and risk colliding with the car with the plow, destroying the materials, damaging Snowpeircer, and potentially derailing the train, or backing up down a siding to get the materials, but backing up a siding requires coming to a stop and remember.... you may not be able to get started again if your batteries are too low. !&lt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*The people:*\n\n&gt;!NPCs interact with the player and eachother. Jobs can be assigned on a train overview screen, People without jobs or in freetime can be seen enjoying leisure facilities or sitting around. Whatever to make the train actually feel alive. !&lt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*The politics:*\n\n&gt;!There is still some Wilford supporters on the train, they are mostly harmless and will mostly just show the W gang sign, talk about wilford and what he did, and get on with their jobs, only generally being slightly resentful at you. however if morale drops too low, these will be the main fighting force you find yourself against politcally speaking. They may try to over throw you as we see Commander Grey and the Folgers attempt in S1. It's up to you how you deal with these people, throw them off or try to improve your repuation with them, but either of these actions risk retaliation from other parts of the train. Throwing them off will provoke a stronger reaction from other Wilford supporters, and some fence sitters, it may also anger ex-taillies, harkening back to their struggles with ""removals"". But trying to appease them may put the ""one train"" supporters against you, as you could be seen as a wilford colaborator. !&lt;\n\n**Gameplay:** \n\nThere are 3 main screens of gameplay. Train overview,  free-roam and the egnine\n\n*Train overview:*\n\nOverview allows you to repair, upgrade, and customise the train (discussed later), as well as assign jobs. This screen could take form of a blueprint style page. With 1000+ cars to customise you can flick between cars or jump to specific numbers. This screenw will have multiple sub menus for the different things you can do. Job assignments can have different options too - best fit, assign specific, and fill labour. Best fit means the game will try to find the best passenger for the job, these can be unlocked through side quests or reviewing the roster, but remmeber tailies weren't on the roster so there may be someone better to do the job. Assign specific allows you to assign a known person to a job, this can bolster morale in that work space as your character will personally know this person (again unlocked through player interactions with NPC). Fill labour simply assigns anyone to the job regardless of skill, this could turn out pretty good for low skill jobs, but for higher skill jobs like hospitality it may be disadvantageous. (default).\n\n*Free-roam:*\n\nexactly as it sounds. 3rd person RPG style, interact with passengers and walk around your 10km long steel tube. This mode is used for side quests, RNG events, and just exploration. Find hidden parts of the train like the observation bubbles, or experience the night car. but don't stay in free-roam too long, else an RNG event may strike at the wrong time. (though it may be a good idea to train some extra engineers for the engine to deal with those so you don't have to) \n\n*The engine:*\n\nThe main screen of the game. Watch the white marble pass past your windscreen, keep lookout for sidings and supply cars, control speed, monitor systems and even adjust the shape of the plow for different terain types. Late game, NPC engineers will mostly handle this for you allowing you to explore or take care of higher level issues, but early game you may find this is the only screen you see for a few revolutions truing to keep the lights on. While NPCs can handle most things, theres noone better than  you to handle RNG events to come to the safest outcome. Also all decisions by NPCs are routed through you, they can call you back to the engine in an emergency, or contact you by hardline for instructions. But the hardlines may go down, so don't stry too far for too long.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*RNG events:*\n\nAvalanches, radio contacts, outside side missions (like repairs), riots, crimes, supply car ecounters, and births. Any number of scenarios could be made to play out having various effects both good and bad. Someone with a better imagination could come up with more events than these. These can interplay and affect resource managment. For example, a birth will increase morale for the whole train as it is a celebrated event, but if that child then freezes due to an avalanche breech morale will drastically drop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Multiplayer?*\n\n&gt;!2-4 person coop, assign roles to your friends or roam together doing quests. One player may be head engineer, while another head of hospitality. a 3rd player could assist breachmen or sanitation, and a 4th may choose to run side quests. While I don't expect multiplayer to be a massive selling point of a game like this, it would be fun to play with friends. Maybe a later version!&lt;\n\n**Extras:**\n\n*Customisation:*\n\n&gt;!I think the best way to consider this game would be a city builder with a single road. Each car can be assigned a ""district"", with 2 modes of play. Simple, and complex. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!In simple mode you simply assign classes, the game automatically looks at the number of cars, the people in those cars, and what resources they need and builds the nessesary infrastructure they need. Housing cars, entertaiment cars, commercial cars, facailty cars, etc. These can be done by an algorithm with plug in numbers. % of residential to commercial for example. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!In complex mode things get messy. You still assign ""classes"", but you can choose what indivdual cars will do. Bowling alley in first? It's now a water storage car. Too much commercial area in third? turn a few into ag-sec. I'm not sure how detailed someone would want to go but it could get pretty complex for more advance players I'd guess!&lt;\n\n*Cosmetics:*\n\n&gt;!While the outside of the train is generally fixed in colour scheme and shape, the inside can be customised paint scheme wise. And the Wilford W's coud be replaced with another logo of your design or choosing. Uniforms may also be customised too but would require a tailor car. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!Having said the outside of the train remains relatively fixed, it may be possible to find a reasonable lore-accurate way to customise the outside. Perhaps a training scheme by which welders and metal workers could be turned into breachmen, unlocking outside cusomisation. Or secret Wilford storage facilities/tunnels that can be sealed off (potentially explored) and used to access the outside. However these facilities are burried in thick snow and only rarely are accessable. But if your train is too long from all the side cars you picked up you can't close them off. !&lt;\n\n*Upgrades/repairs:*\n\n&gt;!The supply cars I mention earlier will contain a good amount of replacement parts and rarely an upgrade. Longer range radio antenas so the train radio can reach further to bolster morale. Upgraded heating system to use less power, or produce more heat. Solar pannels for passive energy generation, better intake scoops for water managment, better brake pads, better motors, etc. On supply car wouldn't be enough to outift a whole train, but they would add percentage bonuses for each upgrade aquired. !&lt;\n\n&gt;!Repairs similarly will require spare parts sometimes. IF a part isnt repaired you'll take a percentage nerf to the accected stat. IE, a broken bogie motor could reduce your speed by 1%, meaning less energy can be produced, less energy &gt; less heat &gt; less morale.  !&lt;\n\n*Research tree:*\n\n&gt;!everyone knows how resarch trees work. research stuf, unlock stuff. But int hec ase of snowpiercer there are a few specialties. Climate research, outside survial research, cold man research, upgrades to cars, higher quality food, better water filtration, connection systems, shock absorbers, fertility treatments etc etc. These give buffs to existing parts of the train, unlock new car types, increase engine stats to allow for more cars, etc. !&lt;\n\nI'm not a game designer by any means, i just love the series and love the concept of a game made around it. Whether rights issues with Netflix would ever allow one to be made or not is another matter, but if any game designers out there want to use this feel free! Send me a beta version and I'd love to test.   \n\n\nDepending how the next season plays out perhaps big alice could still be a part of the train, or perhaps it's detached having been depleted of supplies and relations with their crew made good.

nktn0l,a multiplayer horror where you haunt players to raise their heartbeats in order to kill them.,"So been thinking about this for a while. Ive always wanted a game where the purpose of the game was to fully explore a randomize mansion without your heartbeat raising up to a certain rate. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTheir can be two ways to play the game. 1: use a real heartbeat sensor and try to calm yourself before the ghost uses an ability to scare you. 2. if you don't have a heartbeat sensor, the ghost abilities raises a game heartbeat if you are in sight of the haunting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe more the mansion is explored the more abilities the ghost can unlock. starting by throwing objects, to showing your physical form or loud screeches, even hallucinations. When their heartbeat hit a certain rate, you can attack and damage the player. The ghost wins when you kill all players\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe players win once they explore the entire house and unlock the front door to leave. Lock doors are all over the house and some hidden doors would require puzzles to be solved in order to open them. Players can find items that helps discover if the ghost is in the room or temporary make the heartbeat stop functioning. (protecting the players from attacks.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway this is the basis of the game. A bit like phasmophobia but with a bit of pvp in it."

nksi9m,Dating sim that isn't a visual novel,"hey! so I'm writing a game that focuses significantly on dating mechanics right now, but I don't want it to be a visual novel because they kind of bore me. I've seen some really great ideas in this sub so i wanted to post here.\n\nwhat kinds of features or mechanics could be in a game that focuses on building relationships while still having gameplay??"
nkoeac,"I’m sure this has been done to death, but, give me your “I could totally do Yandere Simulator better, I’d...” pitch","What are your ideas? How would you change the concept, the core gameplay, anything. I think its a semi-universal experience of hearing the story of Yandere Simulator’s development and go “oh well I could do better than that, I would...” \n\nI’ll start. Its a similar format, 2D instead of 3D, but its more of an homage to classic 80’s horror movies than a japanese trope. At the start of the game you are possessed by a “spirit” like a slasher, a slenderman-type, puzzle cube demon, (yes, one is a yandere) etc, and each have a “goal” be it simple like kill all campers, or complex like “reenact the conditions of how you died,” and you have a whole school year to figure out and activate your ploy, while fighting against spiritualists, investigators, and the girl you’re possessing who’s currently fighting you for control. Its the plot of all the horror movies we love but the player is taking the role of the monster, and gets to peak behind their curtain as to how to be this villainous thing."
nko9op,Colossi Raiders: Dark Souls meets Phantom Abyss,"**Concept Overview:**\n\nWatching comparisons of the recent early-access title 'Phantom Abyss' to the phantom mechanic in Dark Souls I started to wonder if maybe the latter's asynchronous pseudo-multiplayer went far enough.\n\nThough I imagine most of this sub is familiar with Dark Souls, Phantom Abyss is new enough that I'll just run both down quickly anyway.\n\n*Dark Souls* features phantoms of other players going about their otherwise single-player adventures, which you can witness die and whom can leave messages for other players, allowing information to be shared between players without actually playing together.\n\n*Phantom Abyss* has similar asynchronous multiplayer, in which players try to complete a temple, for which everyone only has one try, whilst the ghosts of players (ala driving game ghosts) who have previously played (and died) in the temple do their own thing. This allows for information to be shared by watching what they do, where they go, and how they died.\n\nHere's my pitch at what a version of the two combined would look like.\n\n**Gameplay Mechanics:**\n\nThis is a boss rush game, of sorts. Giant colossi (think various Dark Souls or Shadow of the Colossus bosses) roam an otherwise empty wasteland world. You play as an RPG hero of some sort, with perhaps a limited class or loadout system (pre-game customisation, perhaps with unlockables or an in-game earned currency, but no progression once in-game). You are quickly thrust into an environment where you must do battle with one of these powerful entities.\n\nThen, you die. Almost certainly anyway. The bosses are designed to be unfair, overwhelmingly powerful, and capable of finishing you very quickly. Even if you survive their onslaught and dodge their attacks, you'll quickly find them to be HP sponges, and your own stamina to be a finite resource that comes back slower and slower every time you spend it. They *will* outlast you. Importantly you only get one chance per boss - you can go on to fight other bosses whenever you like but you failed at that one, your involvement in the fight against it is over.\n\nThat's okay though, because if you're not the last to fight it, you're probably not the first to fight the monster either. Every beast is it's own procedurally generated 'raid boss' style encounter (save for that you fight it solo), and it doesn't heal between players. You die, then another player turns up at the boss, weakens it further, and so on. Eventually someone turns up against a monster so tired and battered that it is a much easier kill.\n\n**Development Challenges:**\n\nFirstly, procedural generation would be a must. Phantom Abyss works because it has unique temples generated each run. A game like this would require interesting bosses to be generated from a wide pool of potential behaviours/mods/components in order to be challenging. Perhaps different environments, environmental hazards, and adds/mooks could contribute to this, but procedural generation of a single entity would be a design challenge to make feel right.\n\nI have limited experience with multiplayer development so I can't really speak to the challenge of asynchronous multiplayer development. You may be able to reconstruct phantoms from previous information shared by the player, tying that information to each boss instance generated (not unlike how the 'how you died' replays in first person shooters work).\n\nYou could perhaps add in a small 'true' multiplayer component as well, allowing players to band together in 2-4 player groups to challenge particularly powerful bosses. This might go against the 'whittle a big beast down gradually' design however, and highly skilled players being able to solo a monster is already a potential problem.\n\nA sense of progression would be difficult to attain in an otherwise rogue-lite experience. Meta-progression (unlockables or purchaseables for your character) would be a must. Perhaps when that final kill happens all players who fought it gain currency reward (for meta-progression) relative to their own contribution. This could be one of two meta-progression resources, another being experience earned when you die against the monster (which isn't contribution scaled allowing everyone to progress somewhat). See Phantom Abyss for how treasure is released when someone frees your trapped phantom. Sharing boss seeds to your friends to get them to help 'free' your earned currency could be a big part of the game.\n\nKey to the idea of 'a staggered raid taking down a big boss one by one', maybe different aspects of the boss can be broken and defeated piecemeal. The leg has a health bar, the wings have health bars, the eye laser attack has health, etc. Deal enough damage to a particular vital area and the boss cannot ever use that mod/component of themselves again, in all future encounters. 'BeastSlayerXXX42069 gouged out the eye of the colossus on the 4th May 2021' could be something that players loading into the arena see. You might have died but your accomplishment and contribution live on.\n\nOtherwise the key development problem would definitely come down to that common procedural generation design issue - how do you make it random enough to be 'new' most times, whilst handcrafted enough as to be identifiable? Whilst a mixture of procedural generation and handcrafted works great for world generation (see Spelunky), it would be very difficult to pull off with enemies. Perhaps some kind of augmentation/mutation system with cronenberg-like monstrosities where different generated 'mods' rolled into the beasties resulted in new appendages or behaviours. Graphically this could become a problem as well, if you wanted the game to look particularly compelling.\n\nAnyway, just thoughts I had this morn whilst procrastinating working on my own project. Hope someone can do something with this!"

As an avid Dr who, Sci-Fi, space and general gaming fan this is something I've wanted to see for a long long time, I'm surprised there has been any decent Dr who games, but when ""NMS"" first came out it piqued my curiosity and want for a game like this. I have zero real knowledge of how to even begin to make it a reality ii am just a simple gamer with a dream for a game. But who wouldnt like to travel time and space in their own T.A.R.D.I.S?\n\n (First post here so apologies for poor formatting (posting on mobile) or any mistakes)"
nk6m4m,A Wrestling MMO,"Yes, I am going there.\n\nThe basic idea is, you make a character, you go to wrestling school (read: tutorial/training/grind), you train your stats, and join a promotion. You have stats such as charisma, technique (which lessens the chance of botches), popularity (which determines your income and crowd reaction), physical heatlh (the lower, the higher the chance of injury), as well as strength, dexterity, and intelligence, which are attributes directly linked to your character's in-ring-performance but only indirectly influence the crowd reaction. Note that popularity is different to crowd reaction. Popularity is your character's general likability while crowd reaction is the intended positive or negative reaction to your character's actions in a match.\n\nBooker: Ther person that determines the match type, and the outcome of the match. Booking is a template the player has to follow to get the best possible outcome and reward for the player. The booker determines what is and isn't allowed, how the match ends, and how long the match lasts.\n\nFace: The ""hero"" in a match that gets cheered on. Has to do everything to get a positive reaction (pop). Usually fights clean, can be beaten down and still able to turn the match in their favor (comeback).\n\nHeel: The ""villain"".  Does everything to get a negative reaction (heat). Fights dirty, and is able to turn the match with illegal tactics (if regular match). Heat also increases by disqualification.\n\nPop: Positive crowd reaction. Important for faces.\n\nHeat: Negative crowd reaction. Important for heels.\n\nTweener: Neutral character that can get away with illegal actions, but can also get a positive crowd reaction. Crowd reaction is limited, however.\n\nTag Team: A team of two wrestlers (and manager or valet) who compete in matches together.\n\nStable: A group of wrestlers or a faction within the promotion that includes 3 or more characters (not counting managers or valets).\n\nRun-In: Interference of another wrestler not scheduled to be involved in the match in any form. A member of a stable, for example, or another face rescuing the face from a predicament.\n\nGimmick: The in-ring's persona's most striking characteristic. Usually is an exaggerated trait (good or bad), but can also be completely made up. Gimmick is up to the player. The character's action, however, DO matter.\n\nSpot: A predetermined event in a match that pushes the story forward. A risky move, a counter that turns the match in the opponent's favor, or someone falling off a ladder or going through a table.\n\nSignature move: The trademark move for a character that sets them apart from other wrestlers. Sometimes a prelude to a finishing move, an invented move, or a spot or variation of said spot. Usually does not end matches, but can.\n\nFinishing move: The move a wrestler uses to end matches. doing a finishing move more than once, unless it didn't work the first time (evasion, counter, etc.) will get a bad crowd reaction.\n\nKayfabe: Immersion in the match and the willingness of the crowd to suspend disbelief. Kayfabe directly affects your character's popularity and decreases crowd reaction. In the game this would mean a face doing heel-ish things, such as using weapons when they aren't allowed or a heel trying to get a positive crowd reaction, as wll as ending a match too quickly or not as intended or injuring a character, or a character making a run-in when not intended, breaks kayfabe and therefore has a negative outcome for both players and the promotion. Also note that low popularity will decrease the chance of employment, as in it affects your gameplay heavily.\n\nYou also have a hometown-buff, which increases popularity whenever a show is held in your hometown (may it be Vienna, Dublin, New York, Buenos Aires, etc). This does not work in Live Shows that have a fixed location.\n\nYou have 2 types of shows: Live shows and taped shows. Well, more like taped shows and house shows, really.\n\nLive Shows are usually ""booked"" on the fly, so improvisation is necessary. Less charisma is required in a live show, and you can become a fan favourite, though popularity, status and income (money you can buy things with, for example additional training equipment or newer, flashier clothes that will boost stats) will be much less. It's basically a quick instance for people who don't have much time or don't want to spend much time in the game. By choice, any rando (free agent) could come in for the show and be booked, if one chooses to do so. They are more forgiving when things don't go as well as planned.\n\nTaped shows, on the other hand are much more time intensive. You have preparation time, and usually it is a series of booked matches. It is much more rewarding, but also a lot more risky, as it can make or break your character. You can only compete in these promotions if you are a part of said promotion.\n\nGameplay would be turn-based. Players have to work together and play their roles for the best outcome. The matches themselves are instances that can last from 10 seconds to 25 minutes (in rare cases, also 60 minutes), depending on match type. Moves performed will either gain pop or heat. It should also be noted that if you gain pop, the character's heat will be decreased and vice versa. Some moves or actions may also gain short term buffs. Objectives (spots, etc.) are fulfilled during the match."
nk5qjo,The 6 degrees of Bacon,"For those that don't know, it is said that any actor or actress can be connected to Kevin Bacon in 6 degrees or less.\n\nIn this game, players take turns trying to connect any given actor/actress to any other actor/actress in order to score points. \n\nTo begin, each player writes down 10 actors/actresses that have had roles in at least 2 or more films on 10 individual pieces of paper/card which are then collected and shuffled. Then each player is dealt three cards.\n\nOnce it is decided which player goes first, that player must take a card from the top of the deck of cards and read the name aloud.\n\nThen the player's opponents must submit a single card from their hand faced down. Once all the submitted cards have been shuffled, the player selects a single card and reads this name aloud in order to start a minute long timer. \n\nIf a player can connect the two actors/actresses in a single connection i.e where they have starred in the same film, the player wins 6 points. The more connections the player needs to make, the less points they will win. Make more than 6 connections and the player will still win a single point but if they cannot make a connection between their pair of actors/actresses before time runs out, they score nothing. \n\nOnce a player has finished their turn, the rest of the submitted cards are placed at the bottom of the deck and opponents replenish their hand of three by taking cards from the top of the deck before the next player's turn begins. \n\nThis game is more for film buffs than anything but any feedback here is good too 🙂"

nk2va1,My video game idea,"I wanna make refrences to a few other games that i think would be good if they merged into one game...  So first off I think this game should be very customizable with a mix gameplay of black and white 2,sims4,gta,manhunt,thief,assassin's creed,skyrim.. I know that is very mixxed up and kinda doesn't make sense but just an idea.. so in black and white 2 u play a god who has control over a certain area/land and u have to go against other areas/lands their might be other games like this already but what im thinking is mix this with sims 4 which gives u the ability to play as the god/head of the world but then just like sims 4 u get to experience the lives of individuals within ur world aswell... so in black and white 2 u get to play different paths depending on how u treat ur lands u get more grim reality streets look more run down ETC... for my idea of a game i want this to be similar to how it plays out... u can build ur world/worlds.. choose to go to war with other worlds/lands whatever choose to be either peaceful and good within ur world or evil and bad within ur world... the process from good to evil must take time and work.. so u cant just change a good land into a bad land or a bad land into a good land you will have to work on it by building infrastructure\n\nChanging the hearts and minds of the people because for this game i think traits should be included for different lets say ""people"" within the game world.. Similar to the way it is for sims 4 with a little exception... different ""types"" of people within the game should come with a collective trait as a group black and white 2 played on this idea a little... but beyond traits as a group also individual traits.. or however it works it should be that their are all types of different people within your population who react differently to different things.. (however this would work).. Next I think relationships within ur population should also be a thing similar to the way it is in sims 4 also with the made up language in sims 4 i think stuff becomes less repetitive but for this game i think it should be less goofy... probably a  impossible task but i think it should still be suggested... that their are different made up languages within the game that are similar to real world languages.. kinda like that Dothraki language from game of thrones? I think that language would fit for a type of people with harsh traits..\n\n Next the actual gameplay of the game... Well I already said i think u should have the ability to play the game as a lord in the sky and then u can play as a individual but what to do as a individual? well similar to sims 4 if ur living in a peaceful place or even a bad place u should be able to live and do jobs within the land... even in black and white 2 u can select a random person and put them to work and then follow their life until they grew old and die... it should be this way in this game... how long u play as a individual depends on you.. (or until they die) but the lifespan should be customizable depending on ur tastes... u should also be able to follow this individual's life from childhood (going to schools built within the land aswell) now for the gameplay about gta,manhunt,thief,assasin's creed and skyrim... So lets say you dont want to be a good schoolkid and become a good adult... you can start doing bad things from childhood in this game... using similar mechanics to these games because once u play an individual it wont be like sims but more like gta u know... so what do u want to do? steal cars if u want or become a serial killer like manhunt a soldier like imperial legion skyrim or a thief within the land and assassin's creed to become a assassin and parkour legend... also the overall happiness,stability,peace should matter throughout the entire land and if u move from a bad land to a good land you should feel the effect... as different people with different traits will react differently and the overall peace of an area will get different reactions.. well that's about it i think."
nk2ug1,Cyberpunk Resource Management/Strategy/Socially Complicated Idea...,"Cyberpunk is kinda the style du-jour lately, but I got thinking about something that Cyberpunk (both the TTRPG as well as the recent buggy AAA video game) touch on that really could have been expanded on. Characters in Cyberpunk are connected to each other, and those connections factor into how a given conflict or story could unfold, or exactly how dire the consequences of success or failure could be if your character isn't really invested in the fates of everyone else. Imagine a game where you build up a faction of cyberpunk style characters into a personalized faction (gang? crime syndicate? revolutionaries? mercs? corp clean up team?) that is in competition with any number of other similar factions on a city scale. Think..  \n\n\n\- XCOM2 style basebuilding of an underground lair/front/base/etc.. who joins up with you might depend on the kind of front you set up. Nightclubs attract all types of folks and earn good money. But when they get that soundproof booth in the basement, the biz starts really coming in. Merc hideouts are well hidden and protected, but expensive. Standard level work won't pay the rent here forever. Streetdoc clinics get lots of wounded, and those that live are pretty thankful. But once they discovered you were using expired synth-kidneys and twitchy neuroadapters on the sly, biz didn't do so good. And so on..\n\n\- Shadow of War style NPC generation, including concepts like class, skill specialties, fashion style, and most importantly, relationships with other NPCs and players. Can you really trust them? How do you know? What kind of things have they gotten involved with with the other NPCs/PCs? How will that change? Could an enemy suddenly become a good friend because of a single choice? Could someone be stabbed in the back by somone they thought they loved? What happens when you save the life of a friend that was secretly an assassin sent to kill you? And so on..\n\n\- 'upgrade' or 'adapt' your Faction members over time with cybernetics, cool gear, a wide variety of weapons and attachments. Sometimes because you can! Sometimes because you have to. Maybe that one merc friend you have needs a new arm after losing one in a firefight. Or maybe that streetdoc could use new eyes so he can start doing more complicated work. Just remember, if it ain't nailed down it could still be stolen or lost. And if its hardwired to your skin well, some people don't care so much about that. And so on..\n\n\- combat (in whatever form it takes) is chunky, brutal and quickly resolved. Death is permeant. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nlike.. a wierd mashup of xcom, syndicate, shadow of war... not sure if solo, multi, co-op etc.. any of those might be cool tho.  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n.... also hi. I haven't posted on reddit in a long time and I'm clinically depressed. Hello."
nk2tab,A horror game concept with a senior citizen diseased.,"So these days i finished the game resident evil 7, And now im gonna play the saga silent hill and after finish the game one thing comes in my head, ""**What if there a game where we play with a 60-65 diseased man/woman and have to survive with these illnesses.""**\n\nFor example im the game i have pneumonia and i have to cover my mouth to the enemy dont hear me coughing, I cant run too much because of the age, i have amnesia and only can advance in the part when the character remember for a example i go to the objective but the character cant go until he remember and in this intervale that he gonna remember you need to hide from the enemy, The last example i have is the character have parkison syndrome and he has limited movement like he cant crouch he cant lie down and run he can only hide on cabinets and escape from the enemy without the enemy seeing him.\n\nIm with this idea in my mind for a month and i wanted to pass this concept for you guys because i dont see too much games and never see a horror game with a old-aged man/woman.

If you have any other names in mind, let me know in the comments.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ni'm actually making this game in unity, but starting out small with some basic features.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you want any more information about the game so far, or have suggestions, let me know in the comments down below."
njrs1l,Please! Ideas for my cat game,"Hi. I want to make a game which you play as a cat. It has to be a 2D game and not very complex, since I'm a beginner.\nI haven't decided the genre yet."
njood6,Animal Crossing but with gross creepy Zerg-like themes instead of innocent children and animals,"I think it’d be fun to play a game with the intimate and slower pacing of Animal Crossing but working towards a cooler purpose, like developing your swarm of semi-gross aliens."
njnz3u,Question: Which games out there started from this sub? How many (known ones) are there?,I am still hesitant whether to post my idea.
njlzx1,"Thank you all guys, we are now a Hundred..! I'm really proud of this humble beginning🤍",[THANKS A HUNDRED](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKwmNLcMR2Y)
njkyid,"thank you all gays, we are now a hundred, haha",[Thanks A Hundred](https://youtu.be/kKwmNLcMR2Y)
njkr9s,Ideas for single player first person game? (3d),"Not too advanced ideas, I'am intermediate dev."
njjp8w,Star Wars,"A Star Wars game with the style of Halo Wars.\nMaybe have different campaigns for the 3 era's. You can unlock special units, upgrades and hero/villain characters by completing each campaign on different difficulties.\nHave 2 campaigns for each era where you play as either faction.\nMaybe add in special modes where you battle special enemies like death troopers(the zombie ones), planet specific enemies(Geonosians, Umbarans, Twi'leks, Death Watch and the Super Commandos, Wookies, etc. and maybe have random planet specific creature attacks(Nexu, Massiff, Vixus, etc.)."
njj8et,Rockstar collab,"I think it would be really cool, also expensive, if rockstar were to collab with Disney and create a Star Wars game. In which you start as a stormtrooper with a plan to take over the whole empire.\n\nI don’t know if someone has came up with already but it just crossed my mind and thought of sharing that concept."
njgwiv,Turn Based Combat Sim But Actions Are Queued Up And Applied At Once,"In turn based combat sims you usually play out an entire turn where you move all of your units one after another, or the units are shuffled so you and your opponent take turns moving a single unit at a time.\n\nMy idea is a turn based combat sim where you queue up your entire teams actions at once (as well as your opponent) and play them all out together.\n\nSome actions would make other actions impossible (pawn A blow up bridge, pawn B run across bridge) so it would need to be coded in a way where the pawns verify their action is still possible throughout performing them or having them halt midway through if their action suddenly becomes impossible."
njeyb9,Game Documentation,Is documentation really that important?
njcqjz,Medieval zombie apocolypse?,"I'd love to see an open world, possibly pve online medieval type game where you can explore and build up villages to defend etc.\nI can just imagine roaming through fields and forests with the looming threat of undead hordes stalking the wilderness as I make camp each night.\nWould love to make this myself but unfortunately I know nothing about coding :("
njcp58,Is it possible to develop a game like the division?,"I am wanting to develop a game similar to the division 1/2, post apocalyptic city, different factions, looter shooter and making builds. I always start making my game for a month or so then immediately stop. \n\nIs there any other game equivalent to the division that i can make?\n\nThe main mechanics of the game is mmorpg, looter shooter and a city scene (Sacramento or Philadelphia and Camden)"
njay9y,Opinions,Ok so I have a game idea but if I write it right does it sound like something you'd play.\n\n So here's the summary.....You play as a teenager in a weird landscape and your goal is to collect items but it's not required to finish the game but towards the end of the game and a little though out something try's to break through (there is also enemies) and when you reach the end of the game you find out that those items you can collect were there to distract you from what was happening in reality. \n\nSo does that sound like a good game also it would be 2d

nja1dr,1 vs All Multiplayer Tactical Shooter inspired by Rambo or Die Hard,"Imagine you are the ""hero"" of an action thriller, deployed in a closed-off environment with nothing but a basic gun and a knife. You have to eliminate all players on the enemy team or do some sort of objective (detonate a bomb, save 1 or more hostages, etc.). You use the environment to your advantage. You hide, sneak up on enemies that are wandering alone, and pick them off one by one. Eliminating an enemy drops all their guns and gadgets which you can pick up and use against the rest.\n\nThe enemy team is composed of 5-10 players who don't know where you are, but they know that you're coming for them. They don't have a radar or minimap or death counter of any kind, so they don't know when one of their teammates is eliminated.\n\nMaps would need a lot of cover and places to hide. There should be many routes to get to the objective. For example, if we have a skyscraper map, you can use the elevator, take the stairs, climb through air ducts or even break windows and scale the building walls from the outside.\n\nPlaying as the ""hero"" would probably only appeal to the most hardcore shooter fans, but using stealth and strategy I think even intermediate players could do well. Also, it would lead to a lot of amazing moments when you're in a tense 1v5 firefight and you come out as the winner."
nj7r6r,Eldritch Horror without fighting,"Share some ideas on how you would make game centering around the Eldritch Horror theme but your main character cannot fight the creatures (ie. while they can fight or struggle to get away, they’re not picking up an assault rifle and going toe to tentacles with things)\n\nWhat would the character look and act like?\nWhat mythos would you use? (Bonus points for non-Cthulhu gods)\n\n\nOff-topic: First  time posting so I’d thought I’d start with getting creative juices going!"
nj4mxe,Help Evil Corp take corporate domination and take over and destroy the planet forever.,"When I was a kid I used to play this game called Syndicate, It was like a cyberpunk thing where you go around zapping people and taking over their minds. I'm sure there was a lot more to it than that but I cant really remember.  So I imagine the atmosphere of this game would look a lot like Syndicate, but the mechanics more like something like civilization mixed with something of a mafia or sim city type vein.  But your job is literally to destroy the planet... You have to figure out way to dump oil on beaches, destroy nature, log forests, turn entire swaths of the planet into mindless drones through drugs, advertising and media manipulation, buy politicians to get your laws passed, assassinate all the pesky do-gooders and whoever gets in your way, take over competitive companies, keep new eco technologies from ever seeing the light of day, all while staying a well respected businessman. (you lose the game by getting caught, not bribing the right people, or having the laws passed etc. money goes into  patent law, bribery, buying out competition, you know all the regular corporate stuff.)\n\n\nMaybe this will teach people a little more about how its done, raise awareness a little. I'm really not sure how I feel about the mental impact a game like this would have on the player. And of course the problem with real corporations is way more nuanced than this, but Im getting at the tactics at work behind corporate shenanigans that are hidden from most people. I feel like there are so many real life examples to be used in something like this."
nj1h2z,A game that uses both desktop and mobile,"I've been messing around with the idea of making a desktop game that connects to your mobile device through a link to get inputs or display info. My first thought was to use the mobile as a gamepad controller and make twin stick shooter but that seemed very uninspired and I wanted to try something unique. Would love suggestions on what I could make.\n\nNotes: The only inputs that can be made on mobile is the touchscreen, can't use gyro or tilt functionality. Also, I want to minimise the load on mobile, so preferably something light and minimal would be best"
nj0yc1,"I really think that an open world Wonder Woman video game would go over well with DC Fans, Superhero fans, gamers, and people overall",
nj0ka7,Unique city builder themes/settings?,"The more unrealistic the  better. Yet it still has commercial, industrial, residential zoning etc.\n\n* Pseudo-Stone age city builder. Not limited to caveman villages, but all the buildings look like they are made out of stone. Bit like Flintstones without dinosaurs.\n\n* Hell city builder. City builder in hell. Resource gathering, required walls and fortifications against Demons. Some mild Factorio elements (supplying the defenses) and Anno elements (with a bit of combat on top of the city building)\n\n* Cardboard box, toy city builder. Buildings out of cardboard, cars and people look plastic. Otherwise, the economy and infrastructure is as complex as a normal city builder, the setting just looks like a scrappy cardboard diorama.\n\n* Transport-focused arcadey city builder that really leans into ""as many trains as possible, as many planes as possible"". Roads exist only around buildings in a square, no extra roads can be built. Rails are hyper efficient and can do unrealistic, roller coaster like paths even for heavy long trains."
niuz14,Indie developer - Problems,"Hi, I work independently but I recently came across a problem: Pixel Art is and sound production is not my forte. I was planning to pay for the game sprites but it will probably cost me quite a lot. What can I do?"

nipdz1,Mad science - Disrupting the tech tree mechanic,"The idea of disrupting the vanilla tech tree mechanic.\n\nI've seen games do tech trees/research in a couple ways\n\n1. In game menu, spend resources to unlock\n2. Randomized unlock (gambling almost)\n3. Find it in the world, you can research it without needing dependencies via tree\n\nWhat if research has failure? What if that failure was fun?\n\nThe premise, is that the tech tree is hidden information mostly, procedurally generated server side, such that all players have the same tech tree.\n\nYou may or may not know/see end goal (recipes). In the cases that you know what you are trying to build, but don't yet know it, it tells you generic categories that you may need. Example of this is a car engine. You need to know electronics, combustion, mechanical kinetic conversions (gears, pistons, etc).\n\nRegarding failure... things explode. Maybe your nuclear reactor melts down while trying to fix/upgrade it.\n\nMaybe you create a genetically engineered super bee by accident, and it infests your laboratory.\n\nMaybe you are doing advanced particle physics and you create a black hole that destroys your lab. Or a rift to another world/dimension that aliens/demons come through to reek havoc.\n\nShare successes and failures with friends. Mislead your competition with false data?"
nioozy,A war/puzzle game where changing the battlefield is the only advantage you have.,"You have less troops and no control over them, but you change an interactive map that they fight on. You have limited amount of resources to use to give your soldiers enough advantage to win the fight. The more you change the map, the more resources it cost. could be an app game for how easy of a build it would be."

nie04x,Game Idea: Ship building + Pirating game | MMOG,"Okay so imagine:\n\n**Introduction:**\n\nYou start off in a little row boat in the middle of a massive procedurally generated ocean world with lots of little islands to explore. You paddle around and collect resources (driftwood, fish, etc) and do little side quest missions and get paid in booty (gold, rubies, treasure etc). As you collect more stuff, you can upgrade your vessel.\n\n**Vessel upgrading:**\n\nYou start off in a small row boat. But you can quickly increase the square footage of your vessel by paying wood + iron. You can use gold to hire more crew mates. It would be a similar vibe as Sims, just for a boat (a bit more constrained of course). You can upgrade to a multi-level boat. You can install cannons (strength) + more sails (speed). The bigger the boat, the more gold you need to hire crew. For the crew, you need kitchens, sleeping quarters, etc. You can also have a hierarchy within your crew (chief mate (you), second mate, third mate, etc). These crew members can gain XP when battling or completing missions. Experienced crew operate the ship more efficiently (++speed, ++strength). There can be all sorts of cool upgrades that you can do on your ship.\n\n**Fighting:**\n\nBattle other (real) players who you encounter on the big open ocean will of course be an important aspect of the game. All online players sailing around in the same massive world. There will be lots of skill and strategy involved in battling another ship. How strong is your ship? 32 cannons? How agile and fast is your boat? If you win, you get all the reserve ""booty"" that the other ship had in the form of treasures chests that float in the water as the other ship is sinking. You may even nab a few of the opponents crewmates. It would of course be best to sail around with a gang of pirate friends so that if you do cross paths with an enemy, you can easily defeat them. You and your friends can all design your sail colors and flags the same to represent your gang identity.\n\n**Quests:**\n\nThere will be lots of side quests and missions that you can do in the world. Completing these give you resources and bounty. These quests are mainly found amongst the millions of small scattered islands and lagoons. Quests are typically fulfilling bounties. For example, kill a sea monster and receive 1000 gold coins. Or defeat a local group of pirates and get a free ship upgrade. These quests will help your battling skills (needed for when you encounter real players on the open seas!)\n\n**Item collecting:**\n\nLike games like Diablo &amp; Elder Scrolls, one of the most addicting parts of the game will be the item collecting. Besides the ordinary things like fish, wood, gold, minerals, etc. You can find rare artifacts that can be embedded or placed o your ship to boost various attributes. These rare artifacts can be obtained through side quests or just simply found.\n\n**More:**\n\nThere will also be ""neutral"" waters and islands. Here you can trade with other players, sell/buy goods from local merchants, and anchor your ship without having to fear attack. The map should be procedurally generate (endless) except for maybe a handful of the neutral areas that are designed by hand. Side quests should be endless (like Diablo).\n\nI have so many more ideas about the game... But curious what people think of the idea!"

nhzl4i,Avatar the Last Airbender Deckbuilding Roguelike,"Imagine a Slay the Spire-type game with ATLA characters. You play as either Toph, Aang, Katara, Zuko, or Sokka, crawling through a procedurally generated dungeon using turn-based, synergy heavy deckbuilding combat. Each character has their own starting passive ability, cards to choose from, and slightly different mechanics.\n\n—————————————————————————\n\nPlot: Like Slay the Spire, the plot is minimal to non-existent. It would be non-cannon &amp; implausible to the continuity. It would be almost dreamlike.\n\n—————————————————————————\n\n***In this section, I just kinda explain the mechanics of Slay the Spire, so you can skip over this if you already know the game\n\nLike Slay the Spire, you’d go through a procedurally generated dungeon, taking down opponents room-by-room to reach the boss at the end. You build &amp; utilize a deck of cards, each corresponding to different bending moves &amp; techniques in turn-based combat. And just like STS, you can always see the opponent’s next intended move so you can plan accordingly. Along the way, you collect items that provide unique passive abilities (like Spirit Water, Glider, Bison Whistle, the Waterbending Scroll, White Lotus Tile, ect.) Each time you defeat a room, you are allowed to choose 1 of 3 random cards to add to your deck.\n\nEach card costs energy, and you begin the game with a maximum of 3. Each turn, your energy is restored. Each character’s starting deck would contain 5 basic attack cards, 5 block cards (which work like temporary HP that disappears at the start of your next turn), and 2 special character-specific cards. Cards can all be upgraded once; some cards are granted a damage increase or a block increase, some have their energy cost lowered, some gain an edition also effect, ect.\n\nThe path to the end is branching, so to choose a path, you always will be able to see what each room is on the map: Normal Combat, Mini-Boss Combat, Healing &amp; Upgrade Site, Shop, Mystery Room, or Treasure Room.\n\nLike every roguelike, if you die, you start over with a new dungeon, and because of the randomness, no two runs of the game are similar. You have to adapt your strategy throughout each play run, meaning the only way to advance further is to get better at the game.\n\n—————————————————————————\n\nWhile I’d love the game to be more-or-less a knockoff of Slay the Spire, there are some ideas I have that would make it unique:\n\n• Elemental Interaction System •\n\n\nSome waterbending moves could inflict a “Soaked” debuff on targets. The debuff would stack &amp; diminish each turn. Soaked targets could be frozen, sapped of moisture for bonus energy, lowered mobility (whatever that means in a turn-based game), and dealt half Fire damage &amp; double Lightning damage.\n\nSome fire moves would set opponents ablaze. While Airbending would dry Soaked enemies off &amp; put out flames. Water &amp; Earth could interact to make mud, Water &amp; Air could make mist, ect.\n\n• Environments •\n\nBecause the Avatar world involves manipulating the elements, which cards can be played will often depend on the surrounding environment. The randomly generated surrounding area could be made of wood, earth, or metal. It could be flooded, causing all the enemies to start combat with the Soaked debuff, or there could be plants to draw moisture from or control. I think the dungeons would be randomly selected from a few environments. I imagine things like The Swamp, North Pole, Cave of Two Lovers, Spirit World, Sun Sage Temple, Boiling Rock, Day of Black Sun, a Fire Nation Ship Convoy, ect. Each environment will have different bending resources, different opponents, and therefore, different tactics. \n\nEx. In a Swamp environment, enemies will likely be wet, so a Zuko player would have to focus on abilities that utilize his swords, or dry off enemies. However, Fire attacks would do more damage to plant enemies.\n\nEx. Toph’s cards that utilize her Seismic Sense won’t always work on snow or wood. There could be a few cards that provide her with Earth to stand on in these cases, or she can focus on Metalbending.\n\n• Character Encounters •\n\nAlong the way, the player could encounter characters from the show in the mystery rooms. Depending on the character, these encounters could do several different things. Either for free, as a prize if you beat them in a fight, or in exchange for a trade-off, these characters will give you certain unique rewards.\n\nA master could spar with you, unlocking a new bending subtype if you win (metalbending, plantbending, sandbending, sword mastery for sokka, ect). This would unlock a whole new pool of cards to find.\n\nThe character may teach you a valuable move, granting you a card that cannot be unlocked anywhere else, like Iroh teaching you lightning redirection. Or Bumi teaching you about neutral jing.\n\nAnd depending on different factors, some characters will even accompany you for the rest of your run. This includes characters like Suki, Ty Lee, Mai, Momo, Appa, any of the Freedom Fighters, and if you can afford it, Combustion Man or June. These characters joining your party act as passive assists who stand beside you in battle.\n\n—————————————————————————\n\nFinally, let’s discuss characters:\n\n🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊\n\nKatara would have cards dealing with Water, Ice, and Healing. She would need to manage her water sources in order to bend, and could unlock the Water Pouch item to increase her total energy each turn. She could also learn how to Plantbend or even Bloodbend if she meets Hama. (Again, non-cannon)\n\nSome of her signature moves that would be incorporated include:\n\n• Water Whip\n\n• Water Arms\n\n• Octopus Form\n\n• Wave Surfing\n\n• Healing\n\n• Icicles\n\n🪨🪨🪨🪨🪨🪨🪨\n\nToph would be able to see multiple enemy intents using her seismic sense. She would be a defensive character with more heavy &amp; costly attacks than light &amp; cheap ones. Since Toph “waits &amp; listens,” her main strong suit would be cards that plan ahead. I imagine cards that grant benefits to Toph next turn, as well as cards that prepare reactions (like “prevent the next time you would be dealt melee damage, then inflict Defense Down on the attacker”). She focuses on incapacitating enemies, thinking ahead, &amp; attacking straight-on. Over time, she could unlock Metal Bending, Sand Bending, and Lava Bending.\n\nSome of her signature moves include:\n\n• Earth Armor\n\n• Seismic Sense\n\n• Earth Tunnel\n\n• Dust Cloud\n\n• Neutral Jing\n\n🪃🪃🪃🪃🪃🪃\n\nSokka’s cards would involve his machete &amp; boomerang, his wit, and most importantly: his strategic prowess. He could have skills that bend the rules, taunt enemies, and manipulate his cards with skills that draw, reorder, discard, duplicate, shuffle, ect. He would be a very cost-efficient character, being able to play more cards per turn (in fact, I think his passive ability would be drawing more cards per turn.) His runs would also have more character encounters, as he meets Piandao, Hakota, the inventor man (forgot the name), Suki, Yue, and Hawky.\n\nSome of his signature moves include:\n\n• Boomerang\n\n• Sand Attack (like his fight with Piandao)\n\n• Space Sword\n\n• Sneak Attack\n\n🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥\n\nZuko would utilize Firebending, twin swords, and semi-acrobatics to be a high-damaging character. Along the way, he could learn Lightning Redirection from Iroh, or dancing dragon style from the Sun Sages. He could run into Jet and be given the choice to fight him or hide all of his firebending for the rest of the run in exchange for adding the freedom fighters to the party.\n\nSome of his signature moves include:\n\n• Twin Swords\n\n• Aerial Fireball\n\n• Lightning Redirection\n\n• Fire Onslaught"

nhtwcq,Open World in games that are usually not so open,"So this probably has been suggested already, and I feel like it's not an original idea but I haven't seen it so here goes.\nI've always wanted a racing game that would not be racing only, instead that would be the ""main questline"" of the game. We could leave our vehicle and go around exploring, personally buying things for our car, maybe doing some action sequence missions tied to the main story, or just exploring, but the main missions would be more race related (since it's primarily a racing game, only bigger and with more freedom). I've imagined the same thing for fighting games, like boxing and stuff where we could have our apartment and go out to train in the gym and explore the city and meet people for quests. I wonder why hasn't anyone made a game like that yet, mixing up the genres. I think it could be pretty cool and even help set up new standards."
nht5jt,Vampire Valheim - Survival horror where you are the monster,"So Valheim-esque where you survive, craft, hunt, boss fight, progress through biomes and get stronger with all your skills.\n\nBut you are a primordial evil being that devours souls.\n\nYou start off naked and alone, hurt by sunlight so you are only active at night. Defeating enemies grants you a portion of their power. Deer - speed, Boars - strength, Frogs - leap, Humans - resistance to sunlight so you can be active for longer. Your appearance could even change depending on how proficient you were with skills, lvl 99 flight may have big wings, can always hide with clothing.\n\nYou can craft simple things but need knowledge from human civilisations scattered throughout the world to build bigger and better equipment, houses, forges etc. \n\nFirst island you are trapped on because water burns you, you must obtain the knowledge of boats to progress. Each biome is a different theme of human civilization. Viking -wood &amp; boats, Medieval - metal &amp; range, Egyptian - stone &amp; magic, Feudal Japan - black powder &amp; alchemy.\n\nEach biome would have human villages or cities you could terrorise, hide in, destroy or subjugate depending on how you treat the population and their figures of power. Kill - absorb 100% power but raise population fear, Let live - raise fear and renown, Thrall - give power to raise renown. Some civilisations will hate and fear you, some will try and hunt you down, some may worship you openly or in secret.\n\nBosses would be high ruling figures of the population or other monsters from their mythology. Gathering materials is for armour, weapons or magic ingredients - valheim food, or buildings. \n\nCombat can be unarmed, various weapons, mana can be used to cast spells - fireball, wolf transform, invisibility. All ranking up with usage and depending on the enemies you farm for power.\n\nMultiplayer means different civilisations fear/worship different beasts or monsters and may hunt your feral friend who kills all their sheep but whisper prayers to you who saved their king from a Troll."
nhrhya,Games Ideas,[Link](https://sctgames.blogspot.com/)
nhrh3y,Animal Spirit: An open world puzzle game similar to Myst where you are the ghost of an animal,"Feel free to use this idea.\n\nMost ghost stories involve human ghosts, or evil creature type ghosts, but in this game you’re the ghost of a dog or cat.  You were murdered by mean people that abuse animals.  Your unfinished business to to help animals in distress and to bring your killers to justice.\n\nThe game is a blend of Myst and a Nintendo GameCube game called “Geist”, where you were a disembodied spirit that could possess objects and living things (although in this game you can only possess certain objects). In the physical world, you need to possess objects and do things with them to accomplish certain tasks and progress. In spirit realms, you can interact with your environment more easily, but you don’t want to be out of the physical world for too long or you will be pulled into the afterlife and the game is over.  Sometimes, there are portals to a spirit realm, but other times you are sucked in automatically.  Throughout the game, you can interact with other ghosts (human and animal), and in some cases you will need to accomplish tasks with them to progress.\n\nYou can play as either a dog or a cat, and you can adjust the physical appearance at the start of the game.  Dogs are more social, and may be better at interactions with other ghosts. Cats, on the other hand, may be better at some solitary tasks.  I recommend that dogs and cats have different strengths and weaknesses.\n\nMovement is 3-D and open world.  You appear solid in a spirit realm and translucent in the physical world.  As with all ghosts, gravity has no impact on you, and you can move through solid objects and orient yourself in any direction (there is no “up” or “down”).  In a spirit realm, you cannot move through objects, since your environment’s reality phase is the same as yours.\n\nYou win the game when you have saved all of the animals throughout the game and brought your killers to justice. You lose by either not escaping a spirit realm in time or failing to accomplish mission critical objectives.  Either way, you go to the afterlife at the end of the game, whether your business is finished or not.\n\nThe game should involve complex puzzles like the games in the Myst series."
nhqngj,My custom gun maker game in scratch (far from done),This is a game I have been working on for about a week now. It's still far from done and there's no objective but the gun maker funktion is almost done so please take a look and see if you can make some fun combinations!\n\nhttps://scratch.mit.edu/projects/530084347\n\n(Btw i did the math and there is 41160 different combinations)
nhktql,SugarCave,"In this game i was thinking of a game that has a candy theme open world going on but it a high stakes platformer &amp; puzzles solve. This is similar to hollow knight or Mario but 3d like it takes two but solo for most part. The main story line is about a gummy, marshmallow and jelly boy that is trying to stop the  infestation genre engineered insects. This insects where sent by a company that would like to mine the cave for resources. The main gameplay is focus on Guerrilla War tactics and completing puzzles. There is cosmetics for the player to achieve and there is a multiplayer where you race through the platforms with other players just finished first at the finish line. Other game mode where you begin chase by players and have to beat insects along the way like minecraft sped runs. Next gamemode would be a swarm Arena where you fight different insects like shadow of war. The enemies can survive if you make them retreat but they will hold  a grudge on you and try to randomly attack you when free roaming on platforms or you are back in the area. The free roaming lets you take rescue missions bounteous races and random mini games. There is two hubs one for the player and another one for multi player. The player can have a home base for themselves and customize it and the multi player hub is more of large market city to shop with in game currency. \n\nPlease let me know your thoughts and critiques"

nhji3x,How would a science based magic game work?,"Hear me out a game focused around magic in a sci-fi futuristic world where ""Spells"" aren't obtained via spellbooks but by mixing various chemicals and materials from the periodic table \n\nExample to make corrosive poison you would need to mix bromine and piranha solution or to make a fireball you'd need Calcium Acetate and Isopropyl Alcohol plus a way to light it with your tech \n\nI think it'd be fun personally science can make some amazing thing in the real world and I think using science to make ""Magic"" is a nice take on the idea of Witchcraft Alchemy and Wizardry\n\nLet me know what you think"
nheby9,"What ideas do you think, if combined with the Battle Royale game, will eliminate Apex Legends and how can I make the Battle Royale game a different experience🤔?","We all know that Apex Legends gave a different taste to Battle Royale, and don't be aware of what ideas if added to the Battle Royale game will give it a new experience and outperform Apex if you have good ideas share it with us."
nhdgrr,1v1 Randomized FPS,"So I've signed up to reddit to be able to have a place where I can output all the little ideas I get while gaming, most will probably be eh but maybe one will be a hidden gem to someone and they will act on it and I will have a fun game to play :D\n\nSo I just thought about this today.\n\n1v1 Randomized FPS - What does this mean?\n\nI was thinking of having a case opening system like csgo, but whatever gun/weapon you get from the box you will have to use for the round. I think having a bo3 or bo5 will be best. The 3 randomized items you should be able to get would be an ability, main weapon, and some sort of utility. But heres the catch, you will get a certain amount of money every round like in csgo/valorant so you could choose where you want to spend your cash on. Do you have a T1 or a T3 rifle? well maybe the tier 1 could be $500 and the tier 3 could be $2000 with the tier 3 doing more damage. Utility could consists of multiple smoke grenades, stimshots, hearbeat sensor, etc.  I really enjoy doing 1v1s in various games and I think this would add a pretty cool twist and the matches could go pretty fast. For the abilties im still not sure on but im sure i could add on to it later if anyone would like to hear more. Let me know what you think or if theres games similar to this already!"

nh8ske,Procedurally Generated Hunter/Gatherer RTS,"This game will be similar in theme to Oregon Trail, only it will be centered on a tribe of stone age humans. There is no enemy except starvation and fickle mother nature. The tribe will grow and shrink based on the player's success gathering resources from the environment. Each play session will take place in a procedurally generate  map with different resources scattered about the map. At the end of the play session the tribe will move on to a new map with fresh resources. \n\nDuring a play session the player will need to send out tribesmen to scout the new area and locate resources such as berries, animals, water, wood, and flit. Harvesting tribesmen can the sent out with the appropriate tools to gather these resources. Wild Animals can be hunted but also may pose a threat to gatherers. \n\nGathering enough food and water for the tribe's needs will result in population growth between play sessions. Failure to gather enough will result in some tribes men abandoning your tribe   between play sessions. Also casualties from Wild Animals persist between play session. The number of tribesmen the player can have in the field is determined by tribe population. The type of tribesman is determined by the tools on hand. Tools can be constructed from gathered flint or traded at random events between play sessions."

nh3tgd,Underwater Photography Simulator,"I wanted to share the idea I had for an open world game about underwater exploration. The game would be set on Earth in realistic aquatic environments. You would play as an underwater photographer with the goal of documenting as many species species of aquatic organisms as possible, aswell as documenting the various behaviors of said species.\n\nThe gameplay would consist of SCUBA diving in various environments on Earth to look for and photograph various species. I don't think I would want realistic SCUBA diving mechanics, I would just want to explore the ocean unimpeded.\n\nSome species would only appear under specific circumstances, and other species would have unique behaviors under various circumstances. For example, some predators may only come out to hunt at night. Some species are migratory and only appear on certain days, and some species prey on said migratory species. Some species, such as corals, only reproduce on certain days. To photograph these species/behaviors, the game could tell you when they are likely to happen. You would have to plan out some dives ahead of time to have a chance to encounter some of the more unique things in the game.\n\nYou would also be able to randomly encounter very rare species. Some examples of rarer species might include deepwater sharks such as megamouth sharks, some pelagic fish such as the ocean sunfish, and some Cetaceans.\n\nPlease tell me what you think about my idea, and where I need to improve it.\n\nThis idea is heavily inspired by the Endless Ocean series."
nh1rtt,New Game In scratch,[Colourless](https://sctgames.blogspot.com/2021/05/colourless.html)
ngy2wj,Splinter cell like battle royale,"ok so hear me out. The entire map in this game would have light areas and dark areas it would also be small. Unlike splinter cell you don't have night vision, but there are gadgets around like thermal goggles and a flashlight which like in chaos theory are only useful if you want to really make sure there are people there(a flashlight isn't in chaos theory but having a weapon that is turned on or off and  may reveal both your self and enemy players is interesting).  the only way to kill is to land on someone's head or  sneak behind them. At the end of the round dead players will come back as armed mercenaries(can't pick up items) (can be killed) and if your opponent dies from you or them first, you win."
ngx8e0,"Online Life Simulator, but you have roles","That's it. That is the idea... I want to develop something that would be the child of GTA V and Club Penguin, the game where you can be anyone you want, date anyone you want and even kill other players. As far as your role is a killer or something."

ngtd47,A concept I posted on the CnC subreddit but gained little to no attention.,"~~~~~~Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 4 ~~~~~~\n\nSometime after the Events of Uprising, FutureTech Corp. has nearly taken over the World, but several fraudulent and anti-competitive practices has led the Corporation into a trial by the newly-formed International Alliance for Global Defence (IAGD) in the IAGD Unified Court in Paris, France. They were severely weakened by this series of trials and revelations. Someone took advantage of this, the Soviet Underground, though weak, managed to capture the FutureTech headquarters, the HQ doesn't have any guards outside-in because they were banned to do so by the IAGD. Now that the  Underground has taken control of the Corporation, they reclaim their former territories in Eurasia, but they had a problem reclaiming their former territories in the Arab World, another one has risen too. Recently, terrorist groups all around the Arab World have united to form one big and terrifying Alliance, the Sons of God. This Radical Alliance has occupied the entire Arab World including The USSR's former Arab territories (Namely Iraq, Syria, and Libya) and is threatening to also occupy other countries. Because of this, the USSR, temporarily led by their most successful Commander (who also have taken FutureTech Spokesperson Kelly Weaver as a Sex Slave [as their forces transport the frozen bodies of Premier Anatoly Cherdenko and Chief of Staff Marshal Nikolai Krukov to Mexico, which was also occupied by the USSR, to be melted in the hot desert]), officially declared Total War against the Sons of Allah. Because of these growing threats, the IAGD, with its Supreme Commander also declared war against the two emerging powers. The new Empire Of Japan, now led by Emperor Tatsu, allied with the IAGD and used their arsenal, along with new inventions, to help defeat both the USSR, which is starting to become a threat to Japan through the USSR's Chinese and North Korean territories, and the Sons of God, in which they help the IAGD's South-East Asian Wing to repel the terrorists coming from an Sons of God-occupied Malaysia, Indonesia and Southern Philippines. Eventually, the Sons of God, led by its self-declared Leader of the World, ultimately declares an All-out War against the whole world, triggering a 3-way World War. Who will win in this war of the century? The World shall be the Arena for this spectacular competition of military power!"
ngno8h,Heist Game Set in Monaco before and during F1 season,"I just finished watching The B1M's video on Monaco on youtube (Link here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X\_lFFLpHuSQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_lFFLpHuSQ) ) \n\nFirst, I just thought, ""Monacos pretty small. It shouldn't be unreasonable to make a 1:1 recreation of it."" After all GTA V's San Andreas is around 31 square miles; the entire country of Monaco and a few surrounding towns in France are around 10 Square miles. granted, that's 10 square miles of fairly dense urban area rather than mountains and forest, but still a thirst the size of San Andreas.\n\nThen I wondered what could happen on that map. A million GTA clones already exist, but I thought the transformation of the city during the F1 races held there could make for an interesting dynamic of pathfinding during missions. \n\nSo the idea is this: A heist game set during the F1 season. It's entirely free-form like a hitman game. You have to find a team, find vehicles and resources, and plot out a plan while the city is changing and rebuilding itself for the upcoming race. It all culminates in the player actually participating in the race as part of a diversion while the team takes down the target. The player would be able to switch from team member to team member at key moments in single player or a group of players can each have a role in multiplayer. \n\nThere would be no set missions or objectives other than the target (which could be a casino or the F1 race itself like in Logan Lucky) which has to be hit during the race. So the entire game would have a timer attached of 6 weeks which is how long it takes for the facilities in Monaco to be built. Each week would be a chapter with a different stage of construction completed. Players can load into any day within a week (A day would be like 30 minutes), but once that week is finished, it cannot be reloaded and any progress will be saved. So if you accidently destroy your getaway vehicles the at the end of the week before the big race, you're screwed and will have to think on your toes."
ngnacc,A multiplayer evolution game that starts simple before growing and updating in real time as the playerbase grows,"Obviously, there's some Spore influence here, but I also had TierZoo in mind as well as Biblaridion's Alien Biospheres series.\n\nThe first released pre-alpha version of the game will involve playing as an aquatic worm-like creature that is capable of swimming, crawling on the seabed, and burrowing. Pretty much all you do is move around, eat plankton and algae, and gain points. But once you have enough energy to reproduce, you can use the points you've gained from eating food to upgrade your creature, and you can choose from a menu of various parts to grow or upgrade such as eyes, mouths, limbs, tails, armor, respiratory organs, reproduction, coloration, body shape and size, etc. \n\nEvery time the game updates, it adds other players' animals to the game, which new players can play as and evolve in their own divergent direction. Meanwhile, the devs will be changing the environment the players inhabit with each new update, whether it be new types of plants, lowering or raising oxygen levels, making the planet's temperature hotter or colder, splitting the continents, etc., which the players will have to evolve their respective species to better cope. \n\nThere will be both a single and multiplayer mode. In single-player, all the other creatures are AIs, whereas in multiplayer, almost every creature you meet is controlled by another player. \n\nOne thing I haven't figured out is how player species would go extinct. I know that in real life, animals go extinct when they die faster than they can reproduce, but I don't know how that would apply in-game. \n\nOther than that, what I like about this idea is that, unlike other evolution/animal simulator game ideas which are extremely complex and take a while to program before release, this one would be first released to the public as a relatively simple game, only becoming more complex gradually over time. After all, it can't be THAT hard to program a little worm that just swims, burrows, and eats.\n\nAny questions or suggestions?"

npcfr4,Singing Dots Idea,"Singing dots. You start with a singing dot and it sub divides automatically. Soon you have a few dots and resources come into play. Sending the dots to mine dot resources prevents them from singing. Resources allow them to keep singing and to divide.\n\nIdeally focusing on music and music complexity, maybe more dots make more complex songs."
np90li,Someone should make a horror game where if you blink irl something happens ingame.,"The game should utilise the mechanic from ""Before Your Eyes"" story game. Idk if this has already been done but I couldn't find anything on Google. My main idea was that there is some sort of creature in this game and every time you blink or close your eyes it moves or does something, although so much more can be done with this idea."
np6kof,A multiplayer FNAF Co-Op game,"Ever wanted to panic in fear with your friends?\n\nWell, I have an idea.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUp to four players enter a facility, each one choosing a different role.\n\nThe **Nightwatch** is the classic FNAF gameplay - this player stays in a room with cameras and consumes power to turn on lights, close doors, and watch the cameras. The Nightwatch is crucial to the team - as instead of just using audio cues as in normal FNAF, they are more important as they can tell other players when the animatronics come and can close vents in other areas where your teammates may be vulnerable.\n\nThe **Technician** is a different style - the technician roams around in the rooms and performs utility tasks to help other roles sustain themselves. The technician can:\n\n1) Enter the basement and other dangerous rooms to repair generators and lightboxes to increase power.\n\n2) Perform repairs on broken cameras or doors around the map to allow the Nightwatch to use them.\n\n3) Sabotage animatronics who are currently attacking other players, giving that player a short escape (but aggroing the animatronic on you!)\n\n4) Repair the central air system, cooling down the facility.\n\nThe technician is a team-player and the closest thing to a medic.\n\nThe **Chef** is similar to classic FNAF - similar to the Nightwatch, they are restricted to one room: The kitchen. However, similar to the Technician they roam around in the kitchen. The Kitchen camera is broken - making the Chef a more solitary role. \n\n1) The chef can make noise to call in all animatronics in the adjacent rooms to duel them.\n\n2) Fighting animatronics injures both you and the animatronic - the animatronic becomes slower and louder each limb they lose, while you gain ""Injuries"". Animatronics are destroyed upon losing 5 limbs, and you die upon gaining 3 injuries.\n\n3) After fights, you can heal injuries in a time consuming process by eating food and bandaging. The technician can stop by to turn on the stove, allowing for you to kill animatronics at 3 limbs lost BUT attracting more of them.\n\n4) The more limbs animatronics lose, the more likely they will get ""Angry"" at you. Animatronics will start visiting you while you are healing and attack you in greater numbers, two or three at a time. \n\n5) The Chef plays by dueling, but you anger animatronics less if you injure the same one and kill them quickly. While animatronics generally leave the kitchen after a few limbs lost, with the help of other players you can lure them back before other animatronics see them. Killing an animatronic before others see it will not make others angry.\n\n6) The chef relies on the Nightwatch to identify who is outside of the kitchen. Different animatronics have different combat patterns and although they can be identified in-combat, it's MUCH better to find it out via discord friends.\n\nThe **Manager** is more similar to FNAF Pizzeria simulator - they are the objective based player. They sit in an room nearby the Nightwatch, but with no door. The manager is how the team wins - they do objectives and micromanage the facility. The Manager needs to do all their tasks to win - creating noise and heat while doing so.\n\n1) The Manager is vulnerable to animatronics. The only way to keep them out is by hiding under your desk while they come by (and shutting off your computer at the time), or keeping your room cool by opening the vents to discourage animatronics from entering. The Manager relies on their teammate to play well in order to keep the animatronics from them.\n\n2) The Manager, in addition to using the computer to complete tasks, can temporarily disable specific animatronics for a few seconds globally without the risk the Technician has. However, disabling animatronics prevents you from doing tasks, and you can only disable one at a time."
np61p3,"Hey Indie devs, have you ever used any of the ideas on this forum?","I read that a lot of indie developers check this subreddit to get inspired for their own projects.

For example, has anyone tried to create that reverse sim idea or the one where you can alter dead people's pasts as a ghost? These two are the most liked ideas from the past 12 months and sounded pretty fun."
np5s0m,Heist: A game similar to Hide &amp; Seek,"It would be awesome to see this as a video game, but it can also be played in real life.\n\nPlayers: 4+\nAges: 12+\n\nSimilar to Hide &amp; Seek but the object is to get out. The games is to be played using an entire building: The bigger the better. \n\nBefore the game, one person is selected to be the guard. Everyone else will be a thief.\n\nThe players select one of the building's rooms to be the thieves' Lair, and one of the rooms to be the Safe. Now the thieves each put a personal belonging in the safe, and escapes to the Lair. The game can now begin.\n\nThe thieves now attempt to steal their belongings back from the Safe and return to the Lair. If the guard sees AND catches a thief, they are eliminated from the game. The game ends when every thief has either been caught, or succeeded with their Heist. Whichever thief escaped first becomes the new guard. \n\n**Miscellaneous Rules:**\n• The guard(s) cannot simply patrol the Safe or the Lair; they must walk around the building.\n• The thieves may partner/group up, but groups win &amp; lose together. If even one group member gets caught, the entire group loses.\n• Depending on the size of the playing area/desired difficulty, more than one guard can be selected.\n• Both guards and thieves are allowed to use any tools they have/find to their advantage: Just don't destroy the building.\n• Players are encouraged to set traps, cause distractions, and everything else, as long as no one gets hurt.\n\n(Posting this on mobile: I'll come back later to format it better)"
np58gw,Looking for some advise in avatarbased combat,"Right now i am trying to make a small Avatar TLA based Legogame for my younger sister and i wanna add some combat mechanics to make it more interesting. I thought of something like selecting the attack manually in a menu (just like weapons in GTA V) but i am still looking for some moves, wich could be implemented. If you have any ideas for moves wich could be added, let me know. I already got some waterbending moves like ice-discs and a water-shield."
