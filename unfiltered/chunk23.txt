8njw07,Ideas for a 2D game where graphics don't matter that much,"Hi. I'm a new developer, and haven't finished any game, the reason being that all of them were bad because of the graphics, as all of my ideas were based around exploring something and seeing a lot of things. And I'm not goot at drawing.\nBut I really want to make a successful game, or at least finish a game, one which doesn't need too advanced drawings, like characters or other such things.\nIt can be any type of game, it just has to be enjoyable and based around a new ideea.\n\nThank you for reading this and maybe helping me with ideas. I will give you credit and make sure to put you in the list of people who created the game (only me)."
8njvs6,An Adventure Game Without the Story,"Thinking of a game like skyrim, even when you completely ignore the main questline to create a unique story for your character, there is nothing that really gives you a satisfying ending.\n\nI've been thinking of a game with an open world design where there is no ""main story"" questline but only the story that you create for yourself as a player. \n\nThis could be achieved by giving the player character a set lifespan and letting them live their life however they choose. Npc characters could react to these choices differently by calling players different names or asking them to complete different quests depending on how they have been playing the game, allowing different play styles to create unique stories. \n\nThe game would give the stories an ending once the player character dies ending the lifespan, (start at age 15 end at age 80 for example). The game could then recount the achievments of the player that helped change the world around them, like if you discovered a new land, or defended a town from bandits or raided a town as a bandit and became a criminal lord. Basically this game would let you choose your own adventure without setting you down a set path to good or evil"
8niwgf,Neighborhood - A thriller game,"Hello all, first submission here. It's a concept I made a while ago. I thought it could interest somebody so here we go :\n\n## Pitch\n\nYou are an inspector called  to solve a case located in a neighborhood. Someone has been murdered, you got 1 try to figure out who did it.\n\n## Overview\n\n* Nb of players : solo\n* POV : 2D top down\n* Platforms : more likely PC / web\n\n## Details\n\nEach game would take place in a generated neighborhood with \~5 houses/family archetypes \(ie: gym addict family, rich family, or maybe by professions\).\n\nWhen you start the game, the only informations you got is who was murdered and where is the body located \(ie: on the road, backyard, in a house...\).\n\nIn order to find out who did it, you'd have to gather clues \(fingerprints, written threats ...\) from all around the map.\n\nThe point is that each family would have some bitterness for each others and you would have to decide what's true or not based on the clues you'd find.\n\nThe clues would mostly be gathered by following the indications of NPC. They would have a builded memory of what they heard, saw, even smelled the couples of days before the murder.\n\nNPC could say things like ""I saw Michael acting strange yesterday, he was walking half naked in his backyard with a shovel"" but then Michael could have a totally rational and innoncent reason for that.\n\nYou can cast the vote at anytime, even without having any clue \(but you would have to be very lucky\)\n\n## Challenges\n\nIn order to make the game fun, the biggest challenge is to create a coherent background for each family and some events that implies multiples characters to blur the tracks.\n\nI'd be happy to read you feedback !"

8nh2zx,Yokai game,"""Travel around Japan capturing yokai and prevent ancient spirit from being awakened. On your journey, you meet various kind of yokai and learn about their origins. ""\n\nA game like Castlevania where you fight yokai instead of monster. The main protagonist can befriend yokai and use them to fight enemies. There is also a new game plus where you play as your ally which is a yokai himself. Each bosses you fight have their own backstory which you can learn from their own perspective."
8ngpqb,Simulator Ideas?,So i'm basically looking for simulator ideas that are mainly text/stats driven since i dont really like doing animations and stuff (for example: http://filteries.com/politics). 
8ngb7t,Don't Look Down,"**Name:** Don't Look Down\n\n**Concept Overview:**\n\n* Get from point A to point B without falling.  The game is constantly trying to make you fall.  Height is always emphasized in the visuals.  Should trigger people with acrophobia.  \n\n**Plot:**\n* You have to cross a space...say a ledge, a high wire, a building frame, a scaffold...which is high and narrow and easy to fall from.  The structure or things sharing it with you conspire to make this difficult.  Maybe there's some lunatic chasing you trying to knock you off.  Maybe there are strong winds.  Maybe the structure is slippery or prone to wobbling.  \n\n**Setting:**\n\n* A collection of very high, very narrow places.  \n\n**Characters:**\n* Some guy.  I'd say a player-constructed avatar.  \n\n**Gameplay Mechanics:**\n\n* There would be multiple ways to traverse the structures, using multiple movement mechanics.  You could hang from wires, grab on to handholds.  You could have separate controls for upper and lower body for maintaining balance.  Say keypresses to take steps, while the mouse controls how you shift weight for balance.  \n\n**Standout Features:**\n\n* Camera angles emphasizing height.  The camera is ALWAYS looking down.  It moves around a lot while always keeping the player centered, and always having a lot of the abyss visible.  There should be camera focus effects and such to give a sense of distance to the ground.  \n\nWhen you fall, you don't just fall out of sight.  The camera goes with you and follows you to the end.  Think somewhere between Ma-Ma dying at the end of Dredd, and ""Chuck's New Tux.""  Not like gratuitous gore, but enough to make it REALLY uncomfortable to watch.  This should be something you can turn off.\n\n**Possible Platforms:**\n\nAnything that can allow directional control with both hands, and which has the ability to render heights in a way that would terrify people who are terrified by heights.  \n"
8nffwo,A VR mmo about space,"Long wall of text apologize for the bad grammar was on a brain surge and was jay writing it out as it came \n\nMy game idea is called star colony it’s a VR MMO. \n\nThe game is a large open shared universe where you explore the vast galaxy and its planets and civilizations. The goal is to make a name for your self in the galaxy.\n\nEveryone starts on earth where you gather up supplies for your ship the supplies range from weapons to extra fuel and medicine to machines to help colonize planets. Once set you embark and head out to one of the thousands planets, each planet will vary in size and eco system. Some of the planets will be your basic cold or jungle or desert ones, while others will be crazy crystal like ones or ones with eternal night.still others will be unexplorable without the right equipments. You will also encounter a vast variety of species ranging from simple germs to advanced star spanning empires. \n\nThe way you make your mark in the universe is by the following \n\nA.) exploring:you can chose to travel the stars cataloging the vast universe and selling the information of where valuable resources are at \n\nB.) create colonies  : make settlements across the galaxy that other players will be able to work and engage in. they can start as simple straw hut type stuff and turn into vast Starship ports. \n\nC.) resource gathering aka merchant work  and manufacturing: gather the resources of universe and sell it at profit create vast merchant fleets or large factories dedicated to manufacturing what the universe needs.\n\nD.) pirating and security: perhaps you just want to pump a few rounds into people than you can use your skills to do just that . You can be hired to escort valuable cargo across the galaxy or even to steal it.\n\nWhat makes this different is all these goals can be done either with people or against them. You can explore planets with your friends or create large companies ,colonize planets,even fight other human created factions. The aliens will also play a big part in the game as the players will have to learn how to deal with them.\n\nThe game will offer full customization  for person and ship as well as settlement building. You can create and build  simple fast ships or large freight ones to super advanced attack ships. Same with settlements you can be simple as mud huts to large cities that become universally known.  \n\nWhile exploring you must be cautious as death results in you losing your ship and your stats which cannot be gained back unless you have special technical tool like a cloning vat or a return beacon \n\nSkills are what allow your character to interact with the world and change it  the skills range from negotiating to flying to scientific knowledge and fighting tactics etc etc etc\n\nUltimately the goal would be to have this large universe filled with all these different  player controlled civilizations with their own armies and  ships trading or fighting across the galaxy.  \n"
8ndqaz,Mecha Pilot Monitoring/Training,"Imagine your usual mecha setting, but instead on focusing on the mecha action lets focus on monitoring the pilots and giving them the appropriate environment so they can take their tasks properly. \n\nWe could take Princess Maker and Neon Genesis Evangelion as example (Yes, both from Gainax) with maybe a dash of Pacific Rim and dating sim. As for setting it could be either earth being invaded or human colony in another planet.\n\nAt HQ we develop our forces and research, which goes from R&amp;D to upgrade the mechas and facilities, to more personal interactions with the pilots (We've all seen how much of a liability some pilots can be if unstable). This is where we choose what areas to improve of our HQ, choose our pilots and assemble a team, train our pilots in the desired skills (Ex. Survival, fighting, investigation, appeasing). This is also where we influence their bonds with each other (Ex. having certain pilots share a room, schedule their training with other pilots, etc.). All the managing goes here.\n\nDuring missions monitoring their life signs and other readings (stress, vitals, calibration, fuel) and provide the necessary supplies or reinforcements accordingly. Missions could be scouting/exploration, recovery/salvaging, testing of new equipment or enemy interception. This is where the skill training matters for the pilots. We gotta make sure of sending them prepared, keeping them alive and have them return safely, as it cost them their life.\n\nThe goal is to make the player feel like a Director/Captain/Marshal and that they oversee the whole operation, rather than just being on the fighting end of the conflict.\n\nLets do an example scenario: One of the available missions is a recovery mission, a group of biologist got attacked while investigating unknown flora, their location is known, but a hostile species has entered the area, causing them mental shock. This is where the team assembly begins,lets say we take a pilot that has good appeasing skills (call her Mei) and another with combat skills (call him Ike). We also know that Mei and Ike have been lately sharing a strong bond. They are dispatched successfully,  on their way they may ask for one or two reinforcements squads, maybe mild repairs, and once they reach the biologist Mei calms them and tells them to enter a carrier. Unfortunately the hostile species find them, as they weren't quiet enough or had enough knowledge of the nature around that area, causing Ike to fall in battle as it gives the others an opening to return to HQ. Once the mission is over, some of Mei's skills decrease as one of her strongest bonds is lost."
8ndp28,An MMORPG with a full stats system instead of just classes.,"You know how in RPG games like Fallout 4 and D&amp;D, you have stats like strength, intelligence, charisma, etc., and you customize those by starting with a certain number of points \(13 for FO4, generally 27 for D&amp;D\), and spending those to increase your stats? \(unless you roll for stats in D&amp;D but either way my points still work\)\n\nWhy is this not in MMO's? Every MMO has just a set of generic classes with a standard set of abilities, and no way to personalize it besides purely cosmetic ""character creation"" screens that are still limited to what the developers felt like drawing when they made the system.\n\nI think that having full, customizeable stats like described above would be better for an MMO where players can actually make their characters their own. Why is it so rare in multiplayer videogames, but singleplayer games have no problem with it?"
8ndavo,Hunted Anime Protagonist.,"A stealth game where you play as the MC of your sterotypical japanese anime but this MC doesnt want to move the plot, this starts to lead to problems as side characters wish to end the show. By not moving the plot the episode simply resets until the MC does his intended action.\n\nSurvive a 13 episodes time avoiding and tricking the ever increasing desperate side characters looking to end your life and become the MC to move the story. Watch as the bland background grunts and childhood friends transform and change establishkng their own identity towards becoming your boss like enemy.\n\n\n\n"

8n47vv,F-Zero Game Idea,"It would be a pretty interesting story in my opinion. Heck, maybe it could tie into a Star Wars storyline, and we get a Marvel vs Star Wars sort of thing going. That would be pretty awesome.  "
8rk0rt,Realistic building sandbox,A game where you can build anything that can be built in the real world but having all the tools and things you need. The game would use real world physics. Could be useful for building and testing ideas that you would want to make but not sure if it would work.
8rbvpp,A Game Where Stats Level Down As Well As Up,"The idea is a game where your character stats react somewhat realistically to training (for better or worse). The higher you train a given stat the more time, effort and or risk is needed to maintain the stat or improve it further. \n\nA well developed character will require intelligent planning and understanding of the game's mechanics, mindless grinding will only get you so far.\n\nThis could be applied to all sorts of games, sports management sims, western RPGs, RTS, anything stat driven."
8rbgg7,Tetris-type drawing game,"A simple idea for a .io type of game:  Players take turns drawing shapes over a deep pit.  Once the shape is completed (closed polygon), it drops in the pit.  There's physics involved, so the shapes gradually pile up and fill up the pit.\n\nThe kicker is there's a victory line on the top of the pit, *and only the first shape that comes to rest touching the line wins*.  So you'd want to draw big shapes to try and reach the top, but obviously if you don't quite reach the top, you're just handing the win to someone else who can drop a shape on top of yours.  \n\nThe physics part means you'd want to draw something with a pointy top, probably, since that's harder for others to stack on top of,  but it also makes your shape less stable.\n\nAnyway, its a pretty simple idea for someone to prototype and find out if its any good or not.  You'd need to limit the size of the drawing canvas so that people can't just draw one huge shape on the first turn and win. \n\nN.B.  Another wrinkle would be ""bombs"" or something like that; you can use your turn to drop a bomb on other peoples shapes instead of contributing your own shape.  "

8raus5,Should've posted this here instead of r/gamedev -- a brief braindump of a few ideas I've had,"I just discovered this subreddit and realized I wrote a little thing on my blog a few months ago with some of my ideas. I posted it in another sub but maybe you guys will appreciate it a little more.\n\nHere's the link: [https://lincoln-b.com/take-game-ideas-make-better/](https://lincoln-b.com/take-game-ideas-make-better/)\n\nAnd here's the meat of the post (I'll save you a click):\n\n I had a dream where me and a few friends were in a Hunger Games like situation (think PUBG) but instead of encircling walls getting closer and closer, there was a constant stream of water pouring into the playing field, making the water level higher and higher over time. In the center of the map was a tall building with open windows. You had a few minutes to collect items on the ground level before someone went over to break the water main and start the flood.\n\nAlong that same vein, “last man standing” as a genre is largely unriffed. What about a battle royale side scroller? Or how about a man hunt, where one person out of the group is randomly selected, and everyone tries to kill them, and when they die, a new person gets selected? I love what Kevin is doing with [Last Man Sitting](http://store.steampowered.com/app/774291/Last_Man_Sitting/). There’s a lot of untapped competitive multiplayer potential in those type of games.\n\nI would love to see a game that expresses common frustrations with work. Let’s say you start out as a regular worker, and your manager starts out by talking your job up and giving you fun tasks, but then your jobs get slowly more and more menial. From there it could go a few different directions — you could level up and become the manager, and discover that you’re “competing” against your employees; or, you could go a darker route and start taking money from the corporation until they notice you. The only game I can think of that takes place in an office setting is the Sims, and that’s only part of the time.\n\nA game that’s based on physiology principles. You have a single gun, and it has unlimited ammo, but every time you use it, it increases in power. Eventually when it gets to maximum power, it shoots out a series of big shots and then enters a “refractory period”, where you just have to run away from your enemies until you can start charging up your gun again. Most games we see have the same weapons — rifle, sniper, machine gun, bazooka, etc. But there’s a million unique ways you can program a gun to work differently.\n\nMultiplayer games where you have to kill your teammates in order to get to beat the level. When a bunch of friends get together and play a game, they spend about half the time trying to kill each other anyways — why not make it part of the game? Here’s just one version of that idea: when you die, you become a ghost, and you can go through walls and locked doors. So let’s say you have to kill one of your teammates, and then they have to go scare off a security guard on the other side of a door so that the rest of you can get to the end of the level."

8r8or2,Napoleons Regiment,"I thought about a game that combines the ""Map"" and Regiment/Army movement from Napolen TW but in real time. You are a Offizier in the Regiment and controll this Regiment but you also have to follow the orders of your General (KI). If you are a good Comander you can get promotet and be one day a General of an Army!\n\nAt first you you came from a Military Academy to a Regiment. You have to gain the trust of others Regiment, your people in the Regiment, other Comanders and Generals!\n\nThis Game should play in the Time around Napolen. Your Faktion/Emperor/King is KI. It decide if your Faktion is ready for war. Also the highes General (maybe you) helps him with that!\n\nThe map movement should be like Mount and Blade Warband. If you ""only"" controll one Regiment, you go with a General that decide where to go. \n\nAll Comanders and General have there own trust system with each other! So maybe they dont trust you and dont follow your order! \n\nI think with that Game Idea you can make a big and good game. If you have any questions, let me know.\n\nKind regards Mustern!"
8r7t1b,[AAA] Biker Game,"\*Story\*\n\nThe game would have two campaigns, you have to play the first one before playing the second. In the first one, you are an undercover cop infiltrating the MC. You learn all about them, build relationships, etc. Throughout the campaign you are given options on how to act. You may choose to act like a criminal and side with the MC, or choose to act like a cop and side with the police. The key in the first campaign is keeping a balance. If you choose to go full cop, they discover you pretty fast, and you are killed. This will not unlock the second campaign. If you choose to go all biker, the police will arrest you, you will be fired and go to jail. This will not unlock the second campaign. If you stay in the middle, you will get to an option toward the end. You are on the phone with your boss, and you have information on a big arms deal. The boss tells you to tell him, and you choose to either quit the police and join the bikers officially, or tell your boss, getting the club arrested. If you choose to get the club arrested, the President of the club gets arrested and sent to prison, the others are arrested on small charges and you get promoted. This unlocks the second campaign. If you choose to quit your job and help the bikers, during the arms deal, the leader of the crew you are selling guns to says he ran a background check on everyone there, then he rats you out as a being a cop, shows the MC a photo of you, your characters starts to talk but gets shot by one of the other crews men. This will unlock the second campaign.\n\nThe second campaign would be you as a normal guy, ex-military wanting to join the MC. The second campaign takes place a year after the first, and depends on the final choice you made in the first. For example, if you chose to help the MC and got killed, then the President isn't in prison in the second. If you chose to arrest the MC, the President is in prison till a mission where he is killed inside because the current President accidentally starts a war, and the main character in the second campaign is given a mission at some point to kill the main character in the first and make it look like a rival crew did it. You are also given choices but these choices affect whether the club trust you or not. This can cause you to die early, making you restart from a certain spot. The second campaign doesn't really have an end. The end, I guess, would be you becoming President and taking over the MC. Throughout the second campaign you can alter the club, depending on how much people trust you. For example, you may choose to do things non-lethal, and you may try and turn the club into a 99&amp;#37;er instead of 1&amp;#37;er (that means you take the club from being an outlaw club to a civilian club). Doing this may make certain brothers mad try to kill you (or just hate you), it will also decrease the amount of money your club makes, and gives you less to do. The second campaign story is just about your rise into power, and eventually becoming the leader.\n\nA lot of the first campaign is linear and short, while the second is the full game.\n\n\*Map\*\n\nThe game would be completely open world. You can go into restaurants to eat, bars to drink, stores to shop, etc. The map would be a small city in America, but not a real place. \n\n\*Side Missions\*\n\nThroughout the game, you'll get phone calls telling you to go to the clubhouse. At the clubhouse, the club might tell you that a drug deal, arms deal, or some sort of criminal activity is going down and they need you. They may also tell you that you are needed for a charity ride. \n\nIn criminal dealings (such as buying or selling), you will meet a rival MC, ally MC, rival gang, or ally gang. If you are anything but President, all you do is help move the cargo, stand and look pretty, and if things go south, you will defend the MC. If you are President you will discuss prices on the stuff you sell. If the other MC or gang is an ally they are more likely to agree with your prices. If they are rivals, it may take some negotiating. If you don't negotiate as President, this can cause the rivals (or the allies) to get pissed, which can either lead to the deal ending or a fire fight. Some things that affect the deal is your relationship with the other crew, your relationship with police (because there is a possibility of a bust), and past dealings with the crew you are dealing with, or their allies. \n\nCharity runs are just where you get on your motorcycle with your club, and you leave on one of the roads out of the town (you can't drive out of the road normally but for these when you do a short cut scene of all the motorcycle leaving plays). Then you drive for awhile on a long straight road. The scenery on the road depends on where you are going. They're three different locations to go, and these also determine how long the trip is. You may be going to the South East, so you will see a lot of trees. You may be going to the North, so you will see a lot of buildings. You may be going to the south west, and you will see a lot of desert. Depending on weather, your brother's riding skills, and your traits is what determines how smooth the ride will go. If you don't want to ride the whole thing, there is a skip button and it'll either skip to you in the new town, or it'll skip to where there is trouble. In the new town you may stay for a few hours, which gives you an opportunity to talk to the local chapter of your club that's there or the citizens. If you talk to the local chapter and build relationships with them, they may come and help if the MC is ever in trouble. If you talk to the citizens, there opinion of you may go up or down. If it goes up, then you will get more people wanting to prospect. If it goes down then it's harder to do certain crimes cause people are constantly watching you, you might also get kicked out of certain places. \n\nAnother side activity is your actual job. You may be a mechanic and work on bikes and cars. You may be a bartender and serve alcohol. You may be a security guard at a nightclub. They're a few jobs you can have that gives you more income. You can also get fired from these jobs or get promoted even to the point of owning the nightclub, bar, or autoshop.\n\nYou can also help train prospects. \n\nAll of the side activities in the game are endless and can be played forever.\n\n\*Mechanics\*\n\nIn the game you have a speed limiter, which makes it where you can't go over the speed limit. You have to follow the rules of the road or you will get pulled over and have to pay a ticket or go to jail. You also have meters like in Sims that tell you when you need to eat, sleep, use the bathroom, shower, socialize, and drink. \n\nYou create the second campaign's character and have a lot of options. You can also choose what style kutte you want, tattoos, hairstyle, gender, etc. Your hair will also grow overtime, and your character can lose or gain weight overtime. As well as get buff or fat.\n\nYou also have a relationship meter with people that tells you what people think of you. This may affect how certain people act during missions, freeroam, or during a side activity. The first campaign is easier to build relationships than the second because the MC is now suspicious of people\n\nYou can also go to jail or prison, and you can still play the game while inside. If you are sent to jail for less than 30 days, then you can't skip it and you have to live in jail for those many days. If you are sent to jail or prison for more than 30 days, you can skip to you leaving. While in prison you can work, workout, read (which just makes time pass), walk around, make new friends, get potential future prospects, get in fights, defend other members in prison, etc.\n\nYou have to prospect as both characters and depending on how you act determines how long you prospect. And, when you take office, you can sponsor a person to be a prospect, but be careful because that person may be undercover, or a complete idiot, which will get you in trouble. \n\nYou, as the second character, are able to meet certain characters throughout the game that you can date, get married to, and have kids with. As time passes in the game, your kids will get older as well, just like you. \n\nAfter you beat the game, and you are President, you can go to your bed, and set an amount of time you want to skip. Things still go on within that time, but nothing big, and if something big happens because of your previous choices, you are taken out of that. You can skip up to 5 years, but the club will have new members, and will no longer have old ones. \n\nYou will also be able to customize support gear that your club sells, but this really has no purpose other than to make your own ideas. This won't affect gameplay. \n\nYou will have skill bars like in GTA V that has driving, shooting, negotiating, and whatever job you have. Members in your club has driving and shooting as well, and the more you take them on missions, and train with them, the better they will get.\n\nCertain characters will only die during certain points in the campaign, depending on decisions you make. If you finish the game without any characters dying (except for the ones that die no matter what) then your officers will never die and they will all have max skills. If one of the officers dies in the campaign, then you will get a new officer, and they can die on any mission, just like any member who isn't an officer. \n\nThroughout the game you will change positions. You will start out being a citizen (or cop), to being a hang around, to being a prospect, to being full patched, then on the second campaign you will continue and become a enforcer, road captain, Sgt. At Arms, Vice President, then President. Your riding position in the pack changes while you go through these positions. "
8r5qql,Superhero rpg,"Game where you play as a custom (or existing if you’re unoriginal) super hero. Pick your path- select super powers and the game gives you a randomized weakness. When the game begins you’d be a neighborhood hero who can’t take on larger issues alone (so you can’t be a powerhouse right off the bat). The more succesful you are at ‘saving the day’ the faster you gain experiance and possibly unlock new abilities as well as develop your current ones. I think it would be cool if your mission success percent and the choices you make throughout the game impact public opinion. There should be a good and evil path you can follow (different actions you choose will guide you down the paths). There would definetly have to be one (tough) antagionist or multiple of them. How you face them would be up to you the difficulty should range from easy (many other heros help you) to Hellish (you face them all alone; or the antagonist(s) are op). Finally, there should be an online multiplayer mode, idk if it would be good, maybe a 1v1 mode like street fighter, maybe even larger pvp fighting like smash bros. or online missions you can complete with other players.

8r4d2e,Meta: A wikia of ideas.,"I have a wikia of game ideas I've been writing for the last year (since feb, 17)\n\nThe wikia has grown rather large, and I contribute to it daily in the form of bullet-points. \n\nThe main issue I'm having is, I have no idea where to go from this point. I have my wikia of ideas, and that wikia has been pruned and curated for over a year now. every few days I'll remove or add some ideas and over the course of weeks/months I'll remove ideas I grow sick of/don't believe would fit the current vision of the universe.  \n\nThe ideas are everything from engine-work or character-design to things sound-design. like killing a wolf will stop the wolf ambiance during the night, or taking near fatal damage causes the entire world to get darker - or one character called Naya that is my main, fleshed out antagonist.  but there are pages of ideas here not going anywhere.   \n\nThe wikia has always been around 30-40 pages in length, and doesn't seem to be ""branching out"", each of those pages is full of bullet-points.\n\nWhenever I make a new page to expand a bullet-point, I often keep it around for a few days, but then I delete it and sometimes the idea won't even be reverted to it's bullet-point, it'll just get deleted. \n\nHow do I move past this plateau? I'm confident I have more than enough bullet points for at least 1-2 years of development, how do I get past the awkward phase of getting all of these bullet-points to converge, interlink and be expanded without making me remove the ideas?"
8r3ecw,Mobile card game with randomized elements,"I'm an experienced game developer that's making a metroidvania, but I want a funny sideproject that I can use to kill time.  \nI thought about making a card game as it's easy to program and I could play it on android while I'm out.  \nThe problem is, I know nothing about card games.  \nI want a game like Slay the spire, with randomized encounters and cards and effects, but doing that would be straight up making Slay the spire mobile edition. I want something original, I thought about maybe a deck building system or something like that, but that would change the overall way the game would work and as I said I know nothing about card games.  \nSo, if I say randomized card game, what do you think other than Slay the spire?"
8qvbb7,"Whale Hunter: A F2P/pay-to-win game where the bigger you spend, the bigger a target you become for free players.","There was an old Extra Credits episode in which Dan made a case that F2P players in a subscription MMO are a good thing because the free players are essentially ""content"" for subscription players. It fills servers and give those players other people to play with.\n\n**I think the opposite can be true as well.** Whales can be content for the free players.\n\n### How This Works\n\nThis is a PvP (and/or PvE) game where you can spend actual money on clearly better gear and leveling up. There's no upper limit to leveling up. HOWEVER, the more you spend, the bigger a target you become too. The player's body size literally increases. So too does their run stride length, jump height, health pool, etc. all increase.\n\nPlayers who kill, crit or otherwise hinder a whale, will earn an extra fraction of what the whale has spent. The whale doesn't lose money. It's more like money is copied in the form of a microcurrency. Dying to a whale also comes with a small bonus payment too so you don't feel cheated.\n\nThis could be a battle royale game, a simple arena shooter, a vehicular combat game or even a sports game if modified a little.\n\n### Why This Works\n\nIIRC in that same Extra Credits video, Dan talked about an MMORPG in which players could buy gift drops for other players. This player could use that microtransaction to come in and rain gifts upon other players, becoming the life of the party. This psychology can work if a whale effectively becomes the boss fight of whatever multiplayer game he's in. When a whale shows up to your lobby, it's like Santa Claus came to town and everyone is gunning for him. Free players get a bonus objective, while the fat whale becomes the focal point of the party."
8qtorx,New competetive type game,"Hi guys, I would really appreciate if you read this full post and tell me what you think of it and what I can improve.\n\nSo I have had this idea for a while where I want to create a 6v6 competetive base building game. It is kind of a mix between a survival game and a moba.\n\nEach team will get a spawner which they have to place down on a location they think is best. If the spawner isn't placed before one of the team members has died he can't spawn back into the game untill it is placed. The objective of the game is to destroy the other teams spawner. If a team is wiped out before they have placed their spawner they are also defeated. Players can use different kind of materials to build a base around their spawner to protect it.\n\nThe game takes place on a island with lots of trees and rocks and even some animals on it. These are used to build up your base and to stay alive. In the first 2 minutes there is a wall in the middle of the island that seperates the 2 teams so they can safely put down their spawner. After 2 minutes the wall dissapears and everyone can roam over the island without limitations.\n\nBefore the game starts each player can choose between 3 kind of classes: the builder, the hunter and the gatherer. Each class with its own specifik skill set.\n\nThe builder: This class is very good to build up your base, this class can build much quiker and more advanced things than the other classes. This class is also very good to forge weapons.\n\nThe hunter: This class is best for hunting food and to kill and protect gatherers so the other team falls behind on building their base or to protect your own gatherer from getting killed. the hunter is also very good with the bow that he gets for free when spawning. Players can also die from starvation so it's the hunters job to make sure that there is food for everyone.\n\nThe gatherer: This class is used to gather wood, stone and other materials. This guy is very strong and he can carry way more items then the hunter and builder can but he is very weak in combat and needs much protection.\n\nPlayers earn experience by doing things there character is supposed to do, for example, a builder gets experience for building a wall or making a weapon but if he decides to hunt for materials he won't get any experience from it. Experience points can be used to upgrade perks which are specifik for every class. If a hunter gets enough experience he can choose to upgrade his aim, or to receive more food from killing animals. These are just examples I want to create a very large skill tree to really make players think about what they should spend their experience on.\n\nThis game takes a lot of teamplay and strategie to win. Players can choose to play a very aggresive playstyle from minute one and try to get the enemy spawner in the first few minutes by picking 3 hunters, but this tactic can also backfire because if the other team manages to survive they will have lots of materials to build a stronger base and better weapons so they will be much stronger in the late game.\n\nWhen the players are selecting their class they can't see what the other team has picked. So it's always a gamble on what kind of tactic you're going to use. Are you going to sacrifice a gatherer for another hunter? This might lead to falling behind on technology and materials.\n\nIf a player dies he is still in the game but he has to wait a certain amount of time depending on what stage of te game you are in. So if a player dies in the first 5 minutes of the game he will have to wait for 2 minutes but if someone dies in the 30th minute of the game he has to wait for 10 minutes. This is a crucial part of the game because dying really matters. If a hunter dies you're gatherers will become unprotected so one of the other teams hunter might hunt him down. If a gatherer dies, then your builder will have a lot less materials to build with and the other team will have a stronger base.\n\nThere are a lot of different types of animals on the island ranging from chickens to bears. Chickens are very weak and won't give you a lot of food and experience but are an easy target. Bears are the strongest animals on the island, they will take a lot of damage and they can hit very hard. But if you manage to kill them they will give you a lot of food and experience. There will be lot's of other animals.\n\nThere are also a lot of different materials on the island. in the first stages of the game wood and stone will be the most important to build your base but later on materials like iron and sulvur will become very important to make weapons and ammunition. There will be more materials.\n\nI am also trying to implement some elements into the game that can turn the game around. For example something like a baron in league of legends where the losing team can get a buff that brings them back into the game for a certain amount of time. I was thinking of some random events that happen in the game where there is some sort of giant animal and if a team kills it they gain a massive amount of xp.\n\nThanks for reading."

8qi1je,Few ideas inspired by Incarceron book,"Incarceron is one of the best books I red. Main character lives in a ""prison"" and have some visions about a place where is sun and stars, because in prison is always night and it is a shrunken cube. And there is a noble girl in normal world. They can talk to each other with some device and main character with some friends are trying to escape from prison world. So now the ideas.\n\n**Characters:**\n\nTwo characters in totally diferent places that can talk to each other. You can switch between these characters, but it depends on game desing.\n\n**Environment:**\n\n""Prison"": Dark place with ""gangs"" and different groups of people fighting with each other.\n\nOutside: 18th century would be good or something like dishonored. Nice palace where girl lives, she is a noble girl. Some poor villages around. Only ""enemy"" is a goverment.\n\n**Gameplay:**\n\nSomething like the last of us inside the prison. More straight. Not to much open world. 3rd person. Always night with fake moon. It is actually a big world with sea etc. Groups so you need to cooperate with different people, you can read a book. More action. Outside it should be different, not to much action but more puzzles and talking, learning about world, more stealth.  I think outside part would be hard to make interesting enough.\n\n**Other:**\n\n1) Outside world is actually big fake. It looks nice, but everything falling apart. I actually did not get this to much in a book, but it is a nice plot twist (it is in second book named Sapphique). Everything nice is a illusion and now everyone see  ugly reality. This must be very well done and displayed.\n\nI have few more ideas, but they are more specific and hard to explain."

8qgvtc,Pixel Art Camping Game,"Pixel Art Camping Game  \n“Project DigiCamper” (I couldn't come up with a better name)  \n\n\n**Brief Abstract**  \nBasically, the primary goal for this game is provide people who might be inexperienced with camping an entertaining and educational resource which helps them learn the basics of planning, packing, setting up a camp, starting a campfire, etc -- all while providing a pleasantly chill gameplay experience in a wide variety of beautifully true-to-life scenery recreated in pixel art.\n\n\n**General Game Play Phases:** (Not necessarily in order)  \nShop for Gear (gear affects stats such as how long it takes to cook food, how many resources are consumed when making a fire, how warm or cool you’re able to keep your character, etc).  \nPick a camp site &amp; time (this will not only affect the scenery of the game, but also wind, rain, and temperature. These locations will be based on real camping destinations from across the globe. Each spot will offer its own unique resources such as fishing, swimming, hiking, or on-site amenities such as restaurants or saunas.)  \nSetup camp (unpack your gear, lay down the tarp, and build your tent all using drag and drop mechanics which your character will then animate.)  \nFree roam (fish or hunt for your dinner, go for a hike, or maybe take a dip in an on-site hotspring, Take photos to commemorate your experience (pixel art photos will also unlock real life photos of the scenery or the attractions) during this time you’ll be able to monitor your characters needs for things like hunger, thirst, cleanliness, and sleep.\n\n\n**Possible game modes:**  \nRoad Trip: Start with a set budget and try to make it across the nation of your choice without breaking the bank. Will you skimp on gear and comfort to see uniquely beautiful sites?  \nTravel Guide: Try to plan the perfect camping trip for NPCs with various needs, expectations, and budgets.  \nBackpacker: Plan and pack your bag to try and meet your needs (both expected and unexpected), with limitations on bag capacity and/or carry weight.  \nMight Actually Be Homeless: No budget, terrible gear, and extremely limited campsite access on account of not being able to afford places with nightly dues. Your goal is to simply survive and be as comfortable as possible. Fish, gather, and stick close to the earth to ensure that you have everything you need.  \nCamp Ground Manager: Pick a campsite and handle it’s management. Make sure campers are following the site’s rules, clean any messes left behind, and snuff out unsupervised or irresponsibly made fires.\n\n\n \n**Possible Camp Sites:**  \nYosemite National Park (USA): Forests, wildlife, no electricity, no bathrooms, etc, scenic views  \nMount Cook National Park (New Zealand): Fishing, hiking, mountains, etc  \nFt. Pickens (USA): Two beaches, electricity, bathrooms, showers, old forts and ruins.  \nMiyajima (Japan): Beautiful Island, Cabins or Tents, Hand-Feed Deer, visit temples.  \nDevon (UK): Field-topped cliffs overlooking jagged coasts.  \nBig Sur (USA): Deep wood, stream-side camping. Ocean camping.   \nIsle of Arran (Scotland): Mountains, Hills, History, Sailing, Kayaking.  \nThe Alps (France): Skiing in winter, flowers and hiking in summer. Stargazing year around.  \nFlamenco Beach (Puerto Rico (Yes, I know it’s part of the USA)): “The world’s most beautiful beach”, Swimming, Snorkeling, Diving, etc.  \nCorcovado National Park (Costa Rica): It’s the f***ing rain forest!  \nHossa National Park (Finland): Rivers and lakes amid sprawling ancient spruce forests.  \nSahara Desert (Morocco): Camel Rides, Star Gazing, All sorts of stuff.  \nYellowstone National Park (USA): Geysers, Lots of wildlife, bird watching.  \nZion National Park (USA): Steep red cliffs, massive plateaus, forested canyons. Wild camping.  \nLake District National Park (UK): Biking, Boating, and a wide range of camping options from cottages to tents in the wilderness.  \nCotopaxi National Park (Ecuador): Active Volcanoes, mountain top camping, excellent views.  \nLake Myvatn (Iceland): Arora Borealis (Northern Lights), fishing, hiking.  \nJasper National Park (Canada): Skiing, Kayaking, Swimming, fishing. Mountains, giant lakes, waterfalls, hot springs, and glaciers. 600+ miles of hiking trails.  \nLadakh (India): Monasteries, Hiking, Rafting, and Mountain Passes  \nCala Llevado (Spain): Forest Camping with ocean views, snorkeling, hiking.  \nGrand Canyon (USA): It’s the f***ing Grand Canyon, what do I really need to write here?  \n\n\nObviously, there would need to be more, but given that each area will require it’s own unique pixel art for each possible season, weather, and day/night progression – not to mention specialized minigames and attractions (skiing, kayaking, etc); we might be wise to do an initial game release with a dozen or so camp sites and then do updates afterwards. Perhaps we cater these updates to provide additional camp sites by nation, terrain, or some other criteria.\n\n\n"
8qd7kc,Agar.io as a bullet hell,"If I had more time on my hands, I would try to make this myself. Basically, it would be a top down bullet hell like the Touhou series. If the player had, say, 8hp, they could split themselves up into 2 ships with 4hp or 4 ships with 2hp, or 8 ships with 1hp. Each of these would change the balance of the game depending on the circumstances. Using one ship could be more useful when fighting a boss, since the player's firepower is more concentrated, but using 8 ships would be useful against swarms of low hp enemies, since you now have 8 ships firing low damage at once.\n\nIt would also make health management more interesting. For example if the player split up into 8 ships and 1 gets destroyed, then they could form back up and only have 7hp. And say if the player only had 3hp, then they could only split into 3 ships.\n\nWhat to you guys think?"
8qbeut,Duck Dodgers In The 24th And A Half Century,"Anyone who grew up with the classic Looney Tunes cartoons may remember a Daffy Duck short called “Duck Dodgers In The 24th And A Half Century.” It was a Looney Tunes parody of old-school Flash Gordon sci-fi. Daffy’s “role” was the egomaniacal Duck Dodgers, the buffoonish hero of the story; Porky Pig was the “Eager Young Space Cadet,” nominally the inexperienced sidekick, but more competent than Daffy’s character. The villain, of course, was Marvin The Martian.\n\nWhen I was young I became familiar with the original cartoons (I remember there being more than one 1950’s cartoon with these characters), and what I didn’t know is that there was also a spinoff show in the mid 2000’s. That show continued the parodic theme by taking aim at Star Trek, etc.\n\nHere’s the idea, then: do a sci-fi RPG (questing, loot, combat, etc.) based on this cast of Looney Tunes alter egos. Do it right; not some shallow 6-hour ripoff, but a proper sci-fi game. Make fun of Halo, Mass Effect, and Star Wars. Use the whole stable of Looney Tunes characters. You could even ditch standard 3D rendering and make it look like the classic cartoons. Make it something really cool and engaging. Use the original Carl Stalling scores or hire someone to write new material in his style.\n\nHonestly, given the iconic status of Looney Tunes, the content I’ve seen from the brand in the last I-don’t-know-how-many years has been pretty underwhelming. There’s a lot of potential here if it’s done right. This would be a chance to really do it justice."
8qbbc6,An open-world survival where characters from different time periods (and different types) all end up in the same place.,"Each character would be their own class. The classes could include:\n\nCaveman: Can craft stone-age tools and wooden structures. Can craft makeshift rounds.\n\nMage: A medieval spell-caster that can grant structures and people shields. The shields would be temporary.\n\nSoldier: A combatant from the WW1-era. Spawns with a semi-auto rifle and a limited amount of ammo.\n\nMechanic: (Can't decide if futuristic male, or WW2-era female) Can build makeshift land vehicles and repair weapons and structures.\n\nAs you can tell, each class is limited, and the optimal experience would be to join a group with at least 1 of each class. Work together and survive. You could survive on your own, but each class is weak without the others."

Thank you in advance for all your help :D\n\nEach character is assigned a random government name\n\nEach player starts off with 1 warship, a squadron of fighters, and 2 freighters designed for scavenging\n\nInstead of finding weapons, armor, consumables and ammunition you can find shipwrecks, shipyards, recruiting centers and other forms of military buildup\n\nThe map getting smaller would be represented by a large geomagnetic storm (space storm) that encloses constantly but at an extremely slow pace\n\nThere are multiple classes of ships each in its own color coded power level\n\nAll ships of the same ship class have the same stats but have different skins which are randomly selected from a table\n\nGaining control of a populated planet allows it to provide a low amount of materials, soldiers, and ships for a short period of time, while gaining control of an unpopulated world could allow for high amounts of material and supplies to be accessed"
8q87yk,Valiant. RPG/Battle Royale mix,"This is a game that I like to consider a mix between a more traditional RPG and a battle royal kind of game. For sake of ease, I'm going to call this game Valiant.\n\nValiant takes the best from RPGs and Battle Royal and pushes them all together. \n\nYou start the game by creating your character, chosing one of several classes, speccing your character as you like them and finally giving them a name. Then it's time to spawn in to the game world.\n\nThe map in Valiant is pretty large, in comparison to other Battle Royal games, and each game takes a fair bit longer to complete. You're also unlikely to meet anyone else until you get much further in.\n\nThe aim of the game is quite simple. Get to the centre. In the centre is a grand city with a palace. Get to that palace first and you win and are crowned king.\n\nAlong the way of course are various obstacles. Obviously other players but also, monsters, traps and quests.\n\nEach player spawns next to a binding stone. Binding stones can be found all throughout the map but when you start, you'll always be at the far edge. If you find a binding stone out in the wild you can do two things; 1) Bind your soul to the stone, if you die you will spawn here otherwise you will spawn back where you first started. 2) Bind a weapon or piece of gear to your soul. If you have a decent peice of gear you don't want to get rid of, you can bind it to your soul and if you die, you get that gear back. You can only bind one peice of gear to your soul though.\n\nSo you start to play the game, you'll be unlikely to meet anyone for the first twenty mins or so. The main thing you'll want to get is gear. Basic gear can be crafted but for the best stuff you'll want to complete quests and defeat bosses. As you move towards the centre of the map you may come across someone who wants help killing boars or killing a lich in a nearby cavern. Or maybe you'll meet a soldier who needs help finding his lost companions. Complete these quests and you'll earn a pile of rewards:\n\n\* Loot: Weapons and Gear as well as trinkets and if you're lucky a mount. \n\n\* Gold: Gold to pay for services and items in villages and passing merchants.\n\n\* XP: Earn XP and level up your character unlocking a host of new abilities and skills.\n\n\* Soul Points: Currencey that lets your further develop your characters abilities.\n\nAs well as quests there will also be dynamic events and quests that may be something like a large boss spawn and you a load more people have to group up to kill it.\n\nTalking of groups... when you start to play there won't be anyone around, the further inwards you go however the more people that will be there. Valiant isn't a wholly PVP game, though it is a part of it. Most of the wilds will be PVP heavy but a parts won't be. Villages are PVE enviroments, any area with a Binding stone is PVE only (including your starting area). The central city is fully PVP.\n\nWhen you meet someone in game you have several options, you can just ignore them, or you can attack them. Or if you feel like it you can group up with them. \n\nVillages are your respite from the mayhem you'll get up to. You can buy and trade different items, pick up quests, and if you have enough Gold. Pick up a mount. \n\nMount's in Valiant are quite unique. Not like in other RPGs where they don't tire or get hungry. In Valiant, your mount has an exhaustion bar, you work it too hard and it won't want to cooporate anymore. It'll kick you off and run into the wilderness. Treat it right, and you'll gain extra bag space as well as a trusty mount to take you place to place. Mounts, gold and gear don't carry over from game to game. Only your stats do.\n\nSo you've made it to the grand city and have been crowned king. Now what? Well, you'll get a bunch of rewards, xp/soul points plus your overall ranking will improve. So it's time to put some points into your character and play again. Each game in Valiant will last about an hour or so and you'll never be put into a game with people who are much higher level than you. Always around your skill/gear level.\n\nThat's it! I hope you enjoyed. I've been thinking about this for a while so I hope it interested you."
8q7gv0,Vaporwave Game Ideas,"Rather than stating ideas, I would like to ask your ideas for any vaporwave game you have as an idea.

8q7bbu,Just a few ideas,"As the Title suggests this is just a dump of ideas that have popped into my head. Don't expect all them to be answered, and there no guarantee that this comes into value for any game in the future. But hey, could give some people a think, and peoples may give responses that give others ideas.\n\nJust for context think of all these being put into an MMORPG setting\n\nArrows - Now one thing I personally like about single-player games is management of my items, and I was somewhat disappointed with Elder Scrolls Online when I was able to just fire endlessly without ever having to go buy arrows, and to be honest it turned me off from being an archer. The question here is, in an MMO would you rather have to buy/make/find arrows to have better immersion (in my opinion), or would you rather have unlimited arrows simply to attack with.\n\nStealing - With this I'm not talking about stealing from chests and NPC's, rather I'm talking stealing from other players. The question here is whether or not this should be a thing, at least stealing from the player's body? And how it should be handled, like maybe player 'A' has a stealth or pickpocket skill, player 'B' has an observational skill/stat based off some other stats and the pickpocket would be a percentage based off some calculation between Player A's and Player B's skill and, if it falls under a certain percentage, Player 'B' is notified that someone is trying to pickpocket them. Or in reverse Player 'A' is successful in their attempt and player 'B' isn't notified that an item was stolen from them until ten/twenty minutes later and are not informed on who stole it with varying results in between. You could also make it impossible to steal certain items, like items that are currently equipped like swords and armor or items that fall under a certain rarity like 'legendary'.\n\nSmithing - This is another one of those things I enjoy in games, well I enjoy craft going out gathering resources and then turning them into something, this is more focused on the crafting side of that. I have two ideas in my head for this, one is a simplified modeling system, like Maya and blender where one goes into a sub menu and uses the tools there to create there, a calculation system would be put into the system to (using the sword as an example) To measure the length and thickness of the blade and tell you the resulting material cost. That or a more realistic system where you pound at a heated piece of metal to elongate it, adding more ingots to increase the lengths with a repeated process of heating/cooling and hammering though it would obviously be reduced to a point where it isn't too tedious, there would also be a grinding process to sharpen the blade and a step to wrap the handle in leather or some other process. This is just a very rough idea and I can already see it being boring, though I could also see myself sinking hours into that kind of system if executed well, picking and choosing which parts of the crafting process are necessary to simulate and which ones would just be too mundane. Tuning the second system would probably be a lot more difficult for those who aren't interested in the crafting side of games and want to focus more on the adventure side, though in my opinion I see this making high level crafters more valuable and perhaps adding to the experience of those that want to run a successful shop rather grinding for levels and loot in dungeons.\n\nBuilding - This is just a question, do you think a building system could work in an MMO? I kind of like the idea of a player finding a place, like a waterfall at the edge of the forest, and building their house by it. Or maybe in the middle of no where, a well worn road that is used often but it becomes a pain to go from one to the next because maybe players run out of arrows/potion/gold/etc.... and you decide to set up there to both bring in gold and items you don't want to get yourself and maybe get rid of your own junk that you've picked up on your travels that either due to your level or character build so the items don't really work for you. This could lead to player building their own villages, towns and kingdoms, imagine in the course of a year maybe two a small guild turns into it's own mini kingdom. The only thing I don't like about this idea is the potential it brings of players deforesting an area, though maybe adding certain restrictions (Such as the elves ruling the forest like in the Eden's Gate Litrpg series) and re spawn times.\n\nTaming Class - The idea for this is that there would be a class (Though I prefer more free flow character building so more of a skill tree) where everything is based around the taming of the creatures. These skills would be access through an item and there would be skills that gave certain advantages in taming and maybe have more specific skills that help with taming specific creatures For example : Snake Charmer helps with taming creatures that are classified as reptilian, and 'The Groomer' Helps with taming creatures that are classified as mammals. This could lead into higher level skills that could lead into taming 'Mythical' creatures and demons, though demons could be it's own skill set.\n\nTorch magic - Now this was just a crack idea that came to mind, and honestly has no real value though I do think this would be interesting. This skill set would require you to have a torch on you at all times giving unique spells that could be slightly more powerful than normal spells, though the would be limited in their versatility. There could be different types of torches that would allow for more types of spells such as a lightning torch and so on, again this was just a random idea that popped into my head and just something to make torches a little more interesting than just being a light source, as well as making it a viable weapon.\nWhat features would you like to see in an MMORPG?\n\nI appreciate any thoughts and comments."
8q6axp,"Pokemon Fan Game: Specific Ideas, Looking For Feedback!","I'm currently working on a Pokemon fan game. (Not a ROM hack or an RPG Maker edit; a game coded from scratch). It's called Pokemon Gemini, and it seeks to be a more ""adult"" game than the usual core games, addressing certain frustrations that arise from the official games being targeted to a younger audience \-\- e.g. it won't let you over\-level for important battles, it'll have built\-in support for Nuzlocke challenges, the themes will be darker, and the ""stopping a corrupt organization"" aspect won't be obvious until post\-game when you're 10 years older (addressing the concern of ""why is a 10 year old boy expected to fight organized crime?!"").  \n\n\nAnyway, I have a few specific ideas for things I'd like to add, but me not being a hardcore competitive Pokemon player, I'm not sure how balanced or desired they'd be. So I'd like some feedback on the following:\n\n1. Gold Stone and Silver Stone. There's a strong economic theme in the game, with a duality between a richer island that you seek to live on vs. the poor island you currently live on. The Professor is even studying the economic impact of Pokemon. As such, I thought it'd be interesting to have a Gold and Silver Stone. The Silver Stone would be rare, but it would instantly evolve any Pokemon that evolves by level\-up, even if it's not at the right level yet. The Gold Stone would be even more rare, but it would skip one entire evolution, evolving a base 'mon directly into its third stage, skipping the second. (Alternatively, perhaps it'd be a held item, and if the 'mon evolves while holding it, it's consumed and they skip one evolutionary stage? Which is better?).\n2. Tri\-type items. (Names TBD.) The idea would be that a Pokemon holding one of these items would act, for all intents and purposes, as though it had an extra type. So for instance, a Ghastly holding the Fire tri\-type item would act as though it were Ghost/Poison/Fire when calculating resistances, weaknesses, STAB, or anything else that considers 'mon typing. There'd be one for each type, found scattered across the region, with the stronger types found later in the game.\n3. An ability that helps Nuzlockers, who often have the issue of running into duplicate Pokemon and having to re\-encounter constantly: if a Pokemon with this ability is first in your party, you won't encounter any Pokemon which you've already caught. In battle, this ability will increase the Pokemon's speed whenever it faces a Pokemon you've already caught (it stacks as more Pokemon are sent out).\n4. Rather than have every gym leader use specific types of Pokemon, I'd like some leaders to use specific *strategies*. I.E. offensive, defensive, status\-based, etc. As such, I was thinking of some new moves to support each strategy. For instance, a stealth\-based Pokemon might have all sorts of evasion\-increasing and accuracy\-decreasing moves, so maybe there could also be a move that forces the opponent's next move to act like High Jump Kick, dealing recoil to them if they miss? Or an offensive Pokemon may have a move that takes an extra turn to charge, but then removes the opponent's type resistances for the next damaging move used? Etc. Is this a good idea to have moves designed for certain strategies rather than types?"

And I could use some suggestions for that setting!\n\nI would like to make it dark and creepy, but with a Sci-Fi twist... perhaps exploring the ocean bed on an alien world? Or maybe a far-future Earth, where todays civilization has become a myth like Atlantis, ready to be rediscovered?  I'd like to have different bases/outposts to visit, where you can pick up new missions, and an interesting murky landscape for exploring, filled with stuff to look at (maybe alien ruins?). A bit of combat might be ok to keep it interesting, but I'd like it to be more about exploring than fighting.\n\nI'd welcome any suggestions for scenarios, background story, main plot, and anything else you think might be cool."
8syulj,Curious if anyone has ideas for unique weapons,"I've been brainstorming ideas for an action hack-n-slash and I haven't been able to come up with too many extremely varied weapon types. For context, this game is based in present times and utilizes firearms, melee weapons, and elemental magic that can be utilized in a weapon. I have ideas for dual pistols with blades attached under the barrels, a mace whose head extends like a flail to increase range, a shotgun that can be held by the barrel and swung like a club, dual shortswords that combine into a glaive, and basically a circular saw attached to a pole that can be ""revved"" by the player. I would really appreciate any weapon concepts or criticism or improvements on the ones I listed."
8syoge,I need ideas for items in a Metroidvania,"I'm making a 2D platformer with gameplay similar to a metroidvania.

I'd like some more items that have this kind of quality, i.e. unique and allow you to explore further/have multiple uses.\n\nI'd appreciate any recommendations!"
8svxjn,Top-Down Survival Incremental,"This may very well be a game already in existence, since it combines two very common genres, but it does provide a twist on the incremental genre by making your progress visual and forcing your units to undergo survival gameplay, rather than simply generating resources.\n\nYou play from a top-down perspective observing a randomly-generated fantasy world. The world starts out incredibly sparse and dangerous. You can generate a ""settler"" by clicking, and doing so places the settler in a random place on the world. Note that there would either need to be a significant cooldown for this, or the world would need to be VERY large, so as not to overpopulate with too many clicks.\n\nYou cannot control your settlers in any way. They will act on their own as you would in a survival game: chop down trees, hunt for food, and try to craft better stuff. But your first settlers will be dumb and easily killed. The longer the settler lives (or alternatively, upon their death, a function of the settler's production over their lifespan), the more ""god resources"" (working name) you get. These are spent on:\n\n* Improving settler stats (both their survivability and AI)\n* Increasing settlers/click, and increasing chance that they will spawn in a similar location\n   * Settlers should later be able to reproduce given certain conditions, allowing for idle gameplay\n* Increasing ""settler cooperation"" (i.e. that they will try to form villages and work together on projects, as opposed to living isolated across the map)\n* Increasing resource density and resource quality\n* Adding new resources to the world (in turn, allowing your settlers to gain new tech)\n* Something affecting monsters (On the one hand, making monsters steadily weaker improves survivability. On the other hand, making monsters steadily stronger improves rewards. Alternatively, monsters could simply grow over time outside any upgrades, adding a challenge to the game)\n\nThere are two prestige mechanics I have in mind:\n\n1. Worlds are ""levels"" in the sense that your first world will be relatively small and cap out at a certain level of technology. Reaching the highest level of tech/completing some objective (like, kill all the monsters) ""beats"" the level and unlocks the next one.\n2. More typical of the incremental genre, you will hit a point where your god resource upgrades simply cost too much, and prestiging will allow you to generate a new world with bonuses based off of (highest tech, amount of resources previously generated, highest monster defeated, etc.)."
8suybd,"You are not playing as the main character, your are playing as yourself","In this game the main character (MC) is a person who are weak, coward and stupid.\n\nThe game start with you being in heaven.. or somewhere else in 1st person view listening to god.. or whatever asking you to descend and inhabit the mind and body of the MC (not possess) to help him with his adventure saving the world.\n\nOnce you dive down into his mind and body you will see through his eyes. Before you stop reading, i know... this is basically what gaming is but why not purposely use the concept as a plot and new gameplay element?\n\nSo, once you inhabit his mind and body, the only way you can see his face is through mirror or reflection. There is no way the game were shown in other perspective even cutscenes except through the MC’s eyes or (your eyes).\n\nThe MC KNOWS that you are in his body and oftenly talk to you to help him make decisions. He also let you take control of his body to fight enemy or help in relationships with his romance options and NPCs where all of them doesnt know that you are in his body. Stronger relation with NPcs make them help you better in combat like healing you.\n\nSometime, the MC will resist your control of his body and do something foolish and you have no choice but to see all of his stupidity through his eyes, where you cant do anything until you gain back control.\n\nSome other time, you had a choice to let go the control of his body to let him stand up by himself and be a man.\n\nAs the main character talk to you a lot, your relation with him grows stronger throughout the game.

8sttr9,Teen Titans RPG with all member have different mechanics,"After playing Injustice 2 not while ago, i just stumbled on an idea of making an Turn-based RPG based on the member of Teen titans with a main story and superhero missions as side-quests.\n\nI think what most important thing about my idea is how i want each of the 5 member have separate progression system and Playstyle that make them unique between each other. Looking at todays gaming capabilities i doubt it is impossible to make it happen, if you are not focusing on the graphics.\n\nThese are some of my ideas for each character they are not perfect but can be thought over and improved.\n\nRobin: as he mostly uses gadgets and sword in combat, his mechanic are focused on collecting material and crafting cool gadgets with different abilites. As he level up more, he can craft more stronger gadget. Also, sword skills.\n\nCyborg: As he is a cyborg, i think it will be cool if we can customize all his body part like a robot. Also he can do support stuff like scanning enemy weakness etc\n\nRaven: because she is the strongest member of the team if she can control her power, I want her to have a something like rage meter in combat where if filled up all her abilities become OP. And as she level up, she unlock more reasons to fill up her rage meter faster, like taking damage.\n\nBeast boy: As he leveled up, beast boy unlocks more animal form. This animal form all have different set of skills and he can change his form anytime during combat. For exploration, some unreachable places are only available after he learn certain animal form like becoming a whale to cross the sea.\n\nStarfire: Havent thought of it yet\n\nSo thats the gist of it, bad english but i hope you guys understand. What are your opinions on this?"

For most of the players, they would work together, trying to make the humans survive/thrive, trying to get ""followers"", and trying to promote there own porpose/ability. For the other players, (1 - 2 players) they wish for the fall of civilization. They would do things such as bring famine, plague, earthquakes, etc. I'm not  sure how long it would last, but, if the humans all die, obviously the game would end, and those 1 - 2 players would win. That is my idea. "

8sisnb,Endless Fantasy MMO,"Fantasy MMO:-\n\nEarly Game:-\n\n-No traditational experience and levels, your naked character is the same at the begining of the game as at the end, all power is through items, gear, wealth and abilities.\n\n-In the vary early game you can work a profession in a workshop to earn some money.\n\n-Join an army and fight as another players minion, or as an AI factions soldier (when a battle is starting a popup will allow you to teleport there to fight, then back to where you were after).\n\n-Kill monsters in the open world for common loot.\n\n-Player/AI generated dungeons/raids can be run for loot and abilities on a cooldown (one day for dungeons and one week for raids)\n\n-Access to a world wide auction house but it only tells you where you can find an item, then you have to go there or send a minion there with orders to buy (No instant communication from worlds away unless you have a 'Message' scroll, so you give orders like, buy if price is between min and max, then report back)\n\n-Use the auction house to travel to cheap goods, then travel to where you can sell them for profit.\n\n-Buy shops, workshops and houses to make passive income (manually pay council tax per week to maintain protected ownership, if you don't manually pay, it will be automatically billed and you will lose protected ownership meaning the property becomes purchasable by  other players, you still own it and earn money but another player can purchase it from you at any time, if you actually run out of money then a property will be automatically sold until you have nothing. Though unlikely since most properties will earn more than the council tax cost)\n\n-Hire minions/workers to work owned properties (all minions/workers have traits that can help and or hinder there work effort and profit potential, spend money to add and remove traits)\n\n\nEnd Game:-\n\n-Build your own dungeon/raid\n\n-You're paid anytime someone runs it and a bonus if they fail (all dungeons and raids have perma death, so if you die you have to wait for the reset to try again)\n\n-Recruit minions and bosses then position throughout the dungeon/raid\n\n-Hire and send out armies of minions and bosses to attack locations (you can go with, observe or just hear the results after)\n\n-Explore the world and defeat enemies to unlock research opportunities\n\n(Research powerful items/gear, personal abilities, new minions, new bosses and boss abilities)\n\n-Minions and bosses improve levels by fighting, and can be equipped with gear and abilities\n\n\n-Endless advanced procedural world, with generated villages, towns and cities that are part of generated factions\n\n-Build reputation with factions positively or negatively\n\n-Conquer places to build your own faction and empire\n\n-Battle other players factions in an always on world (offline protections in place so someone who plays once every couple days can compete with someone playing all the time)\n\n\n-You can pay to put a shield on a village/town/city that will stop other players from marching in.\n\n-When you place the shield you can choose how many hours the shield will last.\n\n-If you have an army you can place a siege on another players village, this will stop them from updating there shield (which means they can't make it last longer and they can't switch it off)\n\n-Once the siege is in place if both players are online they can decide to begin the siege (requires both parties to agree)\n\n-If the shield timer reaches zero the shield goes down and the attacker can march in, whether the defender is online or not (the attacker can also be offline in which case his siege army will attack on their own).\n\n-If there is no shield an army can march in at any time (So a player who has stopped playing will eventually have unshielded terrority that can be taken).\n\n\n-All items and gear in the game are created through professions and sold to merchants, npc's can buy your goods as well as other players.\n\n-Villages/Towns/Cities can gather and mass manufacturer common items for you to sell.\n\n\n-Form Alliances with other players that allow you to connect your empires and power.\n\n-As well as reputation with AI factions players also have an in-game reputation with other players. Trade and fight together to build reputation, that allows you to form an alliance.\n\n-If you have negative reputation you won't be able to visit their shielded villages/towns/cities (neutral or positive you can enter another players terrority and visit their shops/services, or buy property if purchasable).\n\n-Players have a limited number of control points (can be increased to a point) that limits the size of their empire, have to ally with other players or AI factions to create a huge empire.\n\n-AI factions you are allied with can be shielded for a discounted price."

8sgyev,Arena melee battle,"A skill based arena melee battle. Online of course, but you can hone your skill in practice mode.\n\n#Gameplay\n\nIt will be focused on combat that largely depends on player's skill, not statistics. You control when to attack, block, dodge, run, aim, lock, use item, etc. All characters (that you make) are equal in health, stamina, and defense. There's no number to determine skill, instead you can improve your character in two ways: \n\n1. Augments, these will be the passive/permanent upgrade, you're limited to 3-5 augments per character, it gives small bonus but upgradeable.\n\n2. Equipments, give big bonus, can be broken (and fixed, but each time an equipment is fixed, its ""effectiveness"" reduced), and upgradeable but limited to character's level &amp; rank to ensure fair match.\n\nThere will be no class, you create your own build, such as Knight (heavy armor + sword &amp; shield), Ranger (light armor + bow), Rogue (light armor + 2 knives), etc. \n\nThere will be NO MAGIC, physical battle only.\n\n#Combat\n\nI was thinking something along the Dark Souls or For Honor style. You can switch stances (depending on weapons) and there will be movesets exclusive to certain stances. Some stances are great for attacking a shield, others are great for when you're low on health. Stances also affect attack direction, so if you want to defend against that attack, you'll have to use similar stance or the opposite one.\n\nThere will be classic melee moves like bashing, parrying, counter, backstab, etc. Each will give different effects to opponent (bashing will pry open blocking stance, parrying will stagger, counter &amp; backstab ensure critical hit). There's also ranged combat techniques, but it'll be somewhat like a supporting build since the arena will be pretty enclosed, so it only useful in open map and certain playstyles.\n\n\n\n\n#Match\n\nThere will be a few modes, like Duel (classic 1 v 1), Team Battle (2 to 5 v 2 to 5 players), Deathmatch (3-10 players all against each others), Royal Rumble (100 players deathmatch but only 10 in the map, 1 player dies, 1 player enter), Ring of Bruise (1 v 3 to 5 players) for the masochist, Regicide (10 v 10 but 2 players (one for each team) become the ""King"", if the ""King"" is killed, the team that kill the ""King"" wins).\n\n2 modes for match searching: Quick Match will let the algorithm find your match automatically, Player's Challenge will open a list of game modes created by other players, if it's still open, you can enter it.\n\n#Level &amp; Rank\n\nEvery each battle, you'll earn 2 stuffs (among other things like battle prizes): experience (EXP) and reputation (REP).\n\nExperience contribute towards your character level, *not* account level, and you will receive it no matter the result of the match. EXP will be reduced gradually when you're not playing for a certain amount of time, so you may come back after 4-6 months of not playing and find your character has been dropped 5-10 levels. Level is pretty easy to raise.\n\nReputation contribute towards your rank or tier. You gain REP by winning, and lose some by losing matches, but it won't be reduced by not playing. Your rank will drop 3-4 tiers by the end of a season though.\n\n_____\n\nHonestly, this is an idea I thought up while daydreaming and I don't have too much hope for it. I only write this here for me, so I can come back to every so often to see one of my ideas written on the internet. I like writing my ideas like this and come back later to read it.\n\n\n\n"

8sduxo,One of my ideas (randomly generated arpg),"I've basically come up with ideas for games and stories for fun all my life but I cba to work hard enough to make them a reality. So I'll just share them here so they're heard by someone before I die.\n\nI came up with this one on a 6 day hike just rambling to my friend about it. It wasn't too long ago I had played terraria and I realised that there's no 2d orthogonal or isometric version of it and still to this day there's not. There's really good 2d arpgs coming out every year but none of them are quite like this afaik. Maybe moonlighter will be the most similar?\n\nNow, imagine the original Zelda but every time you start a new world the whole world's randomly generated (which you can actually randomise the original Zelda), it's got more elements to it, AND you can play with friends. The Zelda bit is especially important because I imagine there'd be items like rope, lamp oil, bombs etc you needed to find in order to find secrets and so every new map would have new secret locations, but I digress. An arpg like Zelda/Terraria would be a ridiculous amount of fun, right?\n\nTo delve deeper: imagine you make a custom character and you can pick a ""class"" at the start. The typical choices if you will, or crazy ones; use your imagination. After the start you could change your class whenever just by the weapons you equip. The chests for said weapons would be found on the map or in dungeons following the same formula as terraria and its biomes and map creation. You would be able to dig through the walls. Some walls would need a better pick. All that stuff.\n\nYou would find upgrades and crafting materials in your adventures too. Then just like terraria and minecraft you would be able to craft whatever you could dream of crafting. And you could build your own house and town after clearing up a plot of land and gathering resources.\n\nYour town would fill with NPCs as you built them houses and they would sell you things in exchange. Just for laughs let's say you could date towns member like harvest moon. Haha. The mobs of the world would attack at night tho too so you'd better protect your wife or she'd die... not permanently...\n\nThe world would be full of enemies that scaled in difficulty the farther away from the start you got/by biomes and guarded all the good stuff (fun cosmetic/movement items included). There would be bosses as well barring easy entry into areas you weren't equipped for. You'd get armour and weapons and health upgrades etc as you explored leading all the way to the point you conquered the map and did everything there was to do. Then you could do it all over again in a new world!\n\nThis one of all my ideas is probably the most ridiculously complicated to make but if it was made it would be my favourite game hands down. I left out some details (like of course the game would have a torch/darkness mechanic) to keep it shorter but it's still pretty long.\n\nIf you did, thanks for reading! I'll be back writing more posts probably, depending on how well this is received.\n\nAnd\nTL;DR: Zelda but Terraria.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Main character is   lost world war one soldier. I do not want fantasy (Witcher is inspired by slavic folklore) and I want rifle or some guns from that time in game. Some places could be destroyed because of world war one, so you could find resources there.\n\n**Gameplay:** Player would travel through different locations and in every location would be different fairy tales and characters.

8sa7pg,A Reworking of Total Battle,"I was going to type out paragraphs, explaining this game, but it is better if you just take a look for yourself. Total Battle is a game created by ScoreWarrior, a company located in Cyprus. It appears to be a Plarium knock-off. If you have ever played any Plarium games, you will know what I mean. Endless research, multitudes of buildings, and a focus, more on profitability, than game/battle mechanics.  However, if you have a lot of money to blow, this game may be for you.\n\nTotal Battle is touted as a war game, and it is, sort of. You can attack other players, and defend, as well. But herein lies the problem: You can buy your way to the top. I know many other games offer a similar feature, or features. I understand, to keep the "" lights on "", so to speak, all developers need to turn a profit. But is there not a way to balance profitability, and create a game, that everyone can enjoy, at the same time?\n\nAnyhow, my suggestion for a game idea is this: Take a look at Total Battle. See where things can be toned down, improved upon, and made somewhat cheaper, and go from there."
8s9kdc,Bomber Flight Simulator Idea,"Dearest Reddit,\n\nI hope this post finds you well. I recently girded my loins enough to expose an idea I had for a game to the world. This being a flight simulator focused on the heavy bombers in the European theater in World War two. This would include being able to move around crew from various jobs, assign medical care to injured crew, and being able to take over any job. Much of this game would be a spiritual successor of B-17 The Mighty Eighth\n\n( [https://store.steampowered.com/app/328900/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/328900/) ). Just with a more refined damage/flight model and perhaps a fighter squadron commander campaign. Possible ideas for expansion are new factions/theaters. There is a market for this kind game, as crew-management games like Bomber Crew and the upcoming UBOAT  I am not qualified to bring my dream to fruition but if a game developer out there is looking for ideas, hit me up.\n\nThank you for giving me the time of day,\n\nSHOCKERPA\n\nps. I hope I did this right, this is my first post, if you have questions just ask in comments!"

8s5coc,"Action Chain, the game","You know how in some games, you can start an action chain, and get extra points for it? Yeah, it feels good, right!? Why not just make that a whole game!?\n\nBy doing actions like killing enemies, collecting items, maneuvering through sections quickly, and dodging attacks, you add points to your action chain. (AC) The chain is broken after a few seconds, so you must perform fast and efficiently. It is also broken upon damage or death. Depending on how high your action chain is at the goal, (plus a time bonus so you can’t repeatedly spam one event to get a stupidly high chain) you receive a grade, corresponding to how well you did, much like in the Sonic series.\n\nF - You died a few times, had a crappy time, and barely any AC’s. You generally fucked up.\n\nD - A little better. Everything is competent at best.\n\nC - You’re performing well. Basically played at the speed of an average Mario/Mega Man game.\n\nB - You have a high AC count, and a good time. You didn’t die, good on you!\n\nA - Amazing! You got most of the total AC’s though you may have bumped into a few walls or slowed down for a second\n\nX - You did literally everything perfect and are a badass god."
8s4qyh,A group of ~20 people are sent to a randomly generated boss fight,"Imagine a Battle Royale, but in reverse. Cool? Cool.\n\nYou and your team need to kill the boss within a ten minute time limit. There’s a variety of weapons, including swords, bows, guns, etc. However, the challenge comes from the fact that nearly everything is determined randomly, including...\n\n-Which boss is fought\n-Player spawn location\n-Terrain (though nothing too crazy)\n-Location/Textures\n-Weapon Placement\n-Any intractable objects, i.e. trees, rocks, etc.\n\nOn top of this, the boss is always fought on an island surrounded by water. It’s gradually sinking, thus explaining the need for a time limit. (Despite terrain &amp; textures, the island is always the same size)\nFinally, an experience system is needed to reward players and keep them coming back. Every boss would have a set amount of EXP, and it’s multiplied by the amount of remaining players over 2, then multiplied by the amount of minutes remaining plus the number of seconds. I believe it would look like this...\n\n**(((Boss EXP)(#number of players alive/2)Minutes) + (Seconds)**\n\nSo if a boss has 1,000 EXP, and there are 7 players left, with 2:15 left on the timer, each player would earn, rounded, 7,015 EXP. There would also be little EXP packets scattered around the map, or awarded to players for attacking bosses fast and consistently without taking damage.\nI thought briefly about a mechanic where higher leveled players can give some of their awarded EXP to lower leveled players, but I fear for the arguments that may cause.\n\nAnywho, if you have any suggestions, I’d like to hear them down below."

8s3f4x,New BattleRoyale game idea!,"A Royale game set in fantasy world were the focus of the game are multiple spells that can be mixed and matched depending on your playthrough. For example you have a Golem spell and a Fire element spell (Imbue weapons/ammo/Spells with fire element). You can make Golems with fire dps aura and immunity to flames and seek out enemies near you. There are many spells that can be found in the game and its up to every player to build their own unique build!\n\nUnique Game Features:\n\nThis new royale game is the first to have you choose a tier 1 spell at the start of every game. Basic spells such as Magic missile, Fire bolt, Ice bolt, Low defense wall, Cure, etc. They are weak spells but doesn't consume mana. If you get lucky once landing and stumbled upon a passive spell that raises your Fire rate and Shot speed for all range spells, your magic missile wont be as useless as it looks. The starting spell is also your default spell were it cannot be removed from your arsenal so if you run out of mana from using other spells, you can use this for free. Elemental spells can also have an effect on environment making this royale game the first to have players taking more advantage on their environment. Use lighting on someone swimming on the lake and they will receive extra damage, Use fire to spread on someone near grass or trees, Use ice to make platforms on water and many more!\n\nSome Basic rules:\n\n\- Up to 5 Active spells and 4 passive spells can be equipped aside from 2 equippable weapons and 1 Armor at a time. \n\n\- There is a mana bar in the game and the passive spells don't consume mana. Such passive spells may include faster revives for allies,  Regenerate health or stamina faster, Absorb 10&amp;#37; of spell damage receive as mana and many many more. \n\n\- Active spells have cooldowns to be balance and fair. The better the spell, the longer is its cooldown and some spells are not stackable. \n\n\- Some rare spells or tier 5 spells can only be casted once, like a resurrect spell or Meteor shower similar to a red zone in PUBG. \n\n\- Tier level spells are identified on their color. Gray - tier 1, Green - tier 2, Blue - tier 3, Purple - Tier 4, Gold - Tier 5 (highest)\n\n\- Weapons may include swords, bows, shields, daggers, staffs but the focus is still on making your own Spell set build for every playthough. So this is different from Realm Royale.\n\n\- Similar to other royale games, all spells and items of a dying player will be dropped on the ground.\n\nRewarding Content: \n\nIf you are the last remaining player or team, the map would be cleared and you will be given 3 minutes to prepare for a Random Raid Boss that will spawn on the map. Defeating the Raid Boss rewards you with Random Loots and cosmetics depending on the boss. Allowing players to show off  to others that they have defeated a particular raid boss. So stock up some potions and build a strong character before the 3 minutes of preparation is over!\n\nEndless possibilities:\n\n\- If you have a dagger than can crit enemy players on the back use cloak spell to your advantage or a high tier spell like teleport.\n\n\- If you have a scouting familliar spell like Owl seeker (which lets you identify enemies on a certain field. You can throw a grenade like spell on enemy locations. Be wary as the owl seeker is visible and vulnerable to the enemies. \n\n\- There is an Implode grenade spell which you can use to draw enemies on one location and bombard them with AOE spells.\n\n\- \[Comment down your ideas now! Game developers can update the game with new spells all the time making the lifespan of the game longer.\]\n\nThe Idea behind this:\n\nBefore saying this game idea will be a clusterfuck of endless spamming and OP players, its not. Most battle royal game ends up having instant deaths or quick kills from examples such as Close range 1 hit shotgun, a sniper shot from 150 meters away, 6 shots from an Automatic rifles 50 meters away. I made this game idea so everyone has a fighting chance. It may not be as fast paced as other battle royale games but it is unique and fun. Every run is different as possibly there are 100 or more spells that can be added, scattered around the map but most of them have copies so anyone may get the same spells. I had this idea from Dota, Binding of isaac, and Royale games, combined together and you start of rouge like and build your own hero to fight of others unique builds. If you die, its ok. You can play a new one and spawn somewhere with there are less people so you can build your arsenal safely."
8s27z1,Drama Paradise Video Game Idea,"Drama Paradise (Video game idea)\n\n\nGameplay:\n\nThe gameplay takes place in 2017 across different cities including, Portland, Oregon, Seattle, Washington, Los Angeles, California, and New York City, New York, and the goal is to cause the biggest social media drama in the world by posting anything and everything offensive and harassing others online. The main location where the bulk of the story happens is in Portland, Oregon which has the highest violence volume of protesters and its where the final boss stage is where you have to help the police arrest the protesters causing riots around the city and in the city.\n\nThere are stages where you have to avoid being killed by protesters and holding up offensive signs and wearing offensive outfits and the more people you offend the more points you get and the more money you get paid so you can afford more stuff to offend more people.\n\nThere are certain stages where you have to create such a big drama and outrage in a short amount of time. You have to offend the most protesters and marches as you can. You have to offend protesters and people throwing riots and you get extra points by helping the police arrest the protesters and stop the marches.\n\n\nPlot:\n\nYou play as a magic and ghostly undercover cop named Officer Reggie who will do anything he can to stop protesting and social media outrages around the country and make the 2010s a better place.\n\nHe tries to eliminate the protesters and get them arrested by pretending to be an offensive person so he can get them to attack him. One day he tries and nearly gets killed but survives at the last minute by disappearing in thin air.\n\nHe gets the help from Henry. A millennial who is on his side who helps him find ways of tricking protesters into getting them arrested. So Henry joins the police force comes in and aids Officer Reggie in stopping protests in Portland. Henry guides you in different behaviors that protesters and social justice warriors are capable of and is often your tutorial guide throughout the game to find out exactly what needs to be done.\n\nUpon hearing on the news that a bunch of protesters are gathering up to cause the biggest riot in the entire west coast, starting in Portland and working their way down to the point where the march becomes a terrorist march and this will become the biggest challenge for Officer Reggie and Henry, who must do anything they can to survive.\n\nFirst they have to make their way up by traveling around different cities in the country to stop the protests there upon learning that the upcoming riot will get its recruits from there and they have to stop it before it gets too late.\n\n\n\nGame Modes:\n\nProtest Pursuit is where you have to loose the protesters who are pursuing you throughout The whole city. The more outrage you cause in real life and online, the higher your wanted level goes.\n\nTime Attack you have to cause the biggest outrage online and in person in the shortest amount of time possible.\n\nSurvival you have to survive until you get killed and beat up by protestors.\n\nArcade you can replay whatever game mode and any event you want.\n\nHarass is where you have to Harass as many protestors and users as you possibly can.\n\nOutrage is where you have to simply cause the biggest outrage doing everything. You have to click on all of the buttons as fast as you can in the shortest time possible and then when the timer ends, the game will add up the damage you’ve made with the highest amount of money paid for the damages. Similar to crash mode in Burnout 2 Point Of Impact game.\n\n\n\nPC Controls:\n\nArrow keys - Walk around\nSpace bar - Jump\nShift - Run\nAlt - Yell something offensive\nC - Take off clothes\nZ - Put on offensive outfit\nX - Subdue protestor\nV - Beat up someone\nW - Pull out phone for social media\n\n-On Social media\n\nX - Exit social media\nZ - Send an angry and offensive post\nP - Harass protestor\nC - Harass a user"

When a player is using an infused weapon, the weapon’s DNA sections will affect the player’s base stats, not the gun’s stats.

8rs7mw,"The strange, realistic MMO","So, the idea is: you are dropped in drop pod like [astroneer](https://astroneer.space/) , they choose landing site and you have only basic tools, you have to get something better than rock on stick or on rope. Game would be on VR using 2d treadmill (like [infinadeck](http://www.infinadeck.com/) ) and VR glove controllers. All players would be on one server. After some time (like certain events triggered by players) players would get notificitation implying something alongside ""pack up! (x time units) remaining!"" they would use some button on controller to spawn box in which they could put some things (not too much though). And now comes the big stuff: world would be fully interactable, server would be globe and most unrealistically of all: creatures would be created by natural selection algorithms. All of trees and animals come from one or few common acestors, and minerals might even be used by some species of animals. "
8rra4r,Squad Command MMO,"Okay, so first a caveat, I have no idea how difficult this idea necessary is, especially given the MMO aspect.  Probably rather difficult.  I also don't know whether something like this has been posted before.  It's just an idea that's been at the very back of my head for a couple of years now after having played Planetside 2 for 5 years, and I figured I may as well post it here because why not, maybe someone might derive some interesting and practical ideas from it.  Someone may even like the idea as a whole.\n\nSo, for this game, imagine something like Men of War (or Close Combat) crossed with Planetside, with some type of RTS-style perspective (probably either 2D or 3D would work).\n\nGame is an MMO in which each player commands a squad of up to 6 soldiers; each player has a maximum of six, but may take out to battle any number short of six if he so desires.\n\nEach soldier is his own character with attributes, equipment, and skills/abilities.  Attributes govern innate aspects of character such as weapon handling and dodging ability.  Attributes are universal, but some are more relevant for certain combat roles than others.  Attributes improve with practice of tasks which involve those attributes.  Equipment is what each character is carrying in his inventory and may be bought for individual characters with XP points.  Skills/abilities are what he can do with his attributes or equipment.  Skills/attributes may be unlocked with XP points.\n\nRather than having set classes, a character’s purpose is determined by his current inventory (changeable at any appropriate location—a barracks or something—and involving things like weaponry, armor, miscellaneous equipment such as engineering tools or medical instruments, etc) and attributes, which together determine the skills available to the character at that point.  XP is gained at the squad level from the successful individual or collective actions of characters.  The player therefore has to develop his six deployable characters from a common pool, balancing each one’s needs against all the others.  Characters never die; they become fatally wounded and fall unconscious.  The attributes of characters who become fatally wounded deteriorate over time; the longer a character is fatally wounded, the more the attributes deteriorate.  Characters must be recovered directly by medically-skilled characters or carried by an ally to a triage point to return to combat-worthy status.  (This gives players an incentive to make sure their squad doesn't take casualties!)\n\nPlayers may form both formal organizations (IE guilds/outfits/whatever you want to call them) and ad hoc ones, allowing them to act not just as individual squads but in platoons, companies, battalions, or beyond if enough players come together for a single effort under a single overall commander.  This organizational layer makes logistics very important to this game, as a squad can only sustain itself in combat for a set period of time before running out of supplies (ammo, fuel, etc).  Tactical, operational, even strategic command also becomes an element within the game, as players simply would not be as tactically effective as a swarm rather than as a centrally directed army.  The higher players are in the command hierarchy, the less likely their squad would be involved in actual combat and the more likely they'll be in support roles which enable or augment command-level features to coordinate subordinate players, the necessary logistics, etc.\n\nThe combat would be combined arms, with infantry, vehicles, logistics, etc (think Planetside).  The game world in which all the combat, logistics, etc occurs is a massive, seamless, self-contained continent (again, think Planetside).  Ideally, the game world would have deformable and destructible terrain and buildings or, failing this, at least some opportunity to shape terrain through engineering actions (EG digging trenches, placing barricades and bunkers, etc).\n\nI think it could be fun, anyway."
8rra34,Simple game with toribash-esque combat,"You guys liked my last idea, so here's another. This one I might actually try to make at some point, but since this style of game doesn't seem to be that well known, I think it could benefit from a few clones ;)\n\nAlso, marking this as a beginner idea because it *could* be implemented as a simple console application. The systems are complex but turn based so there's performance to spare in figuring out how to make it all work. \n\nFirst and foremost, [toribash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A17R-2RtDTs). Check that out if you are unfamiliar. Basically, you have 2 characters fighting and you control individual joints on yours. You tell joints to contract or expand and when all players have confirmed their actions, the game plays out those actions for a moment. So if you contract your elbow, your arm will bend forward for ~1 second and then the game pauses to let players make the next set of moves. The amount of time the move goes on for varies with the game mode. ^^^It's ^^^also ^^^a ^^^fun ^^^free ^^^game ^^^if ^^^anyone ^^^wants ^^^to ^^^try ^^^it\n\nNow, my idea...\n\n**abstract**\n\nAn epic fighting game where you decide the moves you would like to begin doing, commit to that decision, and the world is simulated for a few seconds. Then you will have the opportunity to adjust your moves again. The various stats you can put on your character will affect both the abilities of your character and the game mechanics. There will be less specific control compared to toribash. Instead of contracting individual joints, you will decide on locations to move to and actions to perform, and assign various thresholds to those decisions. \n\nNeed to draw your weapon more quickly or dodge an incoming attack faster? Up your strength stat so you can move more quickly. Also up your stamina stat so your limbs can handle the continuous strain of high strength movement. I'll detail the stats now, then move on to general gameplay points, pve &amp; pvp, then lastly some examples of how you can build characters in this game and how the stats can interact.\n\n**Stats**\n\nStamina:\n\n- increases the threshold for limbs to handle force before they begin taking damage\n- increase strain reduction rate when limbs are not active\n\nStrength:\n\n- increase the amount of force your character can exert\n- decrease the time needed to apply higher forces / momentum\n\nEnergy:\n\n- increase the maximum amount of energy your character can accumulate\n- increase the rate of energy accumulation\n\nFocus:\n\n- increase the time allotted for making moves\n\nPerception:\n\n- optionally enable a slower time scale for observing the simulation (relative to the perception level of all entities in a fight)\n- optionally reduce the amount of time you have to wait before entering additional moves\n\n**negative status**\n\nStrain:\n\n- exerting force continuously (moving, pushing things, carrying things, casting spells) will accumulate strain in limbs\n- exceeding strain thresholds (increased by stamina stat) will cause limbs to take damage\n- stop exerting force through a limb to rapidly reduce strain build up\n\nDamage:\n\n- instead of a traditional health / HP system, every limb has its own damage stats (since this is essentially synchronized turn base combat, this can be very in depth without hurting performance)\n- different *damage types* will affect different *limb types* differently (mechanical limbs vulnerable to electricity but immune to shock (pain), organic limbs susceptible to shock (pain) but can recover from damage naturally over time, etc)\n- focus damage on a limb to disable its use\n- focus damage on a critical life supporting limb to end the fight faster\n\nStress:\n\n- taking damage increases stress, damage to critical systems causes larger stress gains\n- stress applies small buffs to other stats in order to help your character put up a fight when they are on the verge of death\n- stress is reduced with strain reduction (recovering from actions) and gradually over time\n\n**combined stat effects (probably more than listed here)**\n\n- Strength and Stamina: resistance to physical damage\n- Energy and Stamina: resistance to *magic* damage\n- Focus and Perception: perception receives a buff from time left over from making moves, which is increased by focus\n- Focus and Energy: small energy accumulation bonus from time left over from making moves\n- Energy and Stamina: channeling energy is similar to exerting force, higher stamina will allow for more magic use before needing a break\n- Strength, Energy, and Stamina: add strength into the mix for your magic character to increase the speed of their limbs to weave magic channeling signs faster, or make your melee character more resistant to magic\n\n**PVE**\n\nSo, you encounter an angry chicken. You engage in combat. The game pauses and the ui for making moves presents itself. You hit submit/play without making a move to stand your ground and observe the chicken. 1 second of gameplay happens and you see the chicken is charging at you. The game pauses. You tell your character to step back and a slider comes up to adjust the amount of force to use. You drag the slider up until the time needed to reach the desired location is 1 second, bringing strain on your legs up to 60%. You also choose to begin concentrating magic into your right hand, increasing the strain on your hand by 20% and your arm by 10%. The game starts playing for a second, your character jumps backwards and raises its arm which begins to get little ignition sparks, and the game pauses. During that time, the chicken advances another foot, giving you plenty of room. You decide for this low level enemy, the amount of energy you accumulated over that 1 second is sufficient, and release it at the chicken. Hand strain peaks but will quickly reduce to 0. The game plays, your character throws a fireball, and the game pauses right before the 2 make contact. The chickens strength and perception are too low to get out of the way, so you just hit play again to watch the next segment of the simulation play out. The chicken is incinerate and you collect some feathers, a beak, and some cooked chicken. \n\n**PVP**\n\nI won't elaborate here too much because it's similar to PVE combat, minus the live player. The relative stat interactions will also be the same, but maybe a little more disorienting the first time you play against another player. For example, if there is a MASSIVE difference in perception, focus, and strength, the other player will appear to be able to move twice as fast as you and react to things between turns. If the difference was literally 2x, it would play out something like this:\n\n- player 1 charges forward\n- player 2 charges forward\n- in half of the expected time, the game pauses but player 1 cannot make any additional moves\n- player 2, with their higher perception, tells their character to jump sideways to avoid the charge\n- the game simulates another few seconds\n- player 1 commands their character to turn around\n- player 2 uses their higher strength and perception to make their character position itself behind player 1 before they are able to even finish turning around\n- player 2 types ""omae wa mou shindeiru"" in the chat\n- player 1 types ""dammit lol"" in the chat\n- player 2 turns their force exertion in the right arm up to the max and lets the game play\n- player 2 punches a hole through player 1, killing them, but the bones in player 2's arm break from exceeding their maximum strain thresholds\n\nOk, so now you have an idea of how the stats *can* interact. Here are some more random interactions off the top of my head for various builds:\n\n**barbarian**\n\n- max strength and stamina\n- min perception\n- this character is very resistant to physical blows\n- this character can exert maximum force without breaking limbs because the stamina and strength are equal and above certain thresholds\n- this character is committed to moves made because of their low perception, having a few points of perception will make this character appear to move in slow motion\n\n**mage**\n\n- low/min strength\n- max energy, stamina\n- mid/high focus and perception\n- with the interaction between focus, perception, and energy, this character builds up energy quickly enough to channel reasonably powerful spells continuously throughout an entire match\n- with focus and perception interactions, the mage can react to enemies dodging by manipulating the direction and flow of spells\n- this character isn't necessarily resistant to magic, but could easily produce magic to counter incoming damage\n\n**ranger**\n\n- low stamina\n- high focus, perception\n- mid strength\n- Utilize focus and perception to aim better and make projectiles harder to dodge\n- uses strength to counter the shock / knockback of projectiles being fired\n- minimal stamina needed for firing weapons because they do not exert continuous strain\n\n**hybrid benefits**\n\n- a melee character will benefit from perception so they can make those powerful limbs more reactive\n- a magic character will benefit from strength by allowing their limbs to move into position faster for various magic signs / gestures, the time saved could make the difference in battling other magic characters\n- a ranged character will benefit from more stamina if they were to use something like a gatling gun which would apply continuous strain. Bows do not require a lot of stamina because focus/perception account for the time used to aim those shots, which reduce the sustained limb strain\n- a ranged character will benefit from high strength if they wanted to carry around &amp; fire a cannon\n\nEssentially, my idea is adding stats and complexity to toribash."
8rr7ut,Battle Royale Simulator,"Hey, I've started working on a hobby project with the wonderfully imaginative placeholder name - ""Simulator Royale"".\n\nBasically I felt that playing PUBG was too stressful for me and required too much of my attention and time; and watching streamers was fun, but I felt like I had 0 interaction / progression from it.\n\nSo this is where this game idea was born, to have a sort of a battle royle simulator/manager, where the player doesn't actually play the game itself, but rather gives high level instructions to a bot; said bot improves it's own skills with the weapons the more it plays, and by winning matches it gains major prizes (to improve skills) and goes up arenas, fighting harder enemies.\n\nI've got a prototype up and running, it's pretty basic - and I would love to get feedback on it.\n\nWhat I'm looking for:\n\n* Feed back on whether or not you like the idea (And what do/don't you like about it)\n* Ideas for further features and things you'd like to see\n* Where to take this thing from here? :D\n\nPrototype download link:\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1Rc77IIZ8yV0zy8K3jVD3uiQphrmuOLQ9/view?usp=sharing\n\n---\nThanks!"

After the real news is dropped of your task will be to replace it with daddy Russia’s fake news. \n\nThe challenge will be dynamically generates yards you must navigate without waking the homeowners. Some obstacles would be flood lights. Dogs. \n\nAfter a level you will be scored and payed. Payments can be used to upgrade your bike, buy dog treats to help you and other gadgets to help as levels get harder. \n\nScore will allow you to access harder levels as dad trust you to not be found out. \n\nOk, I’m rambling but hopefully you enjoyed it. \n\nIf your at all interested in this or helping make it a reality I would love to collaborate. I have some cumbersome projects right now and can’t realistically shift gears right now but I thought I’d put it out there. \n\nAlso, I’m pitching for mobile &amp; tv. "
8rpnx1,NPC driven horror game ideas,"Here's some ideas I'll never use based around the same concept. I'm an aspiring game dev who won't get into horror so here's some ideas I wrote down to get out of my head.\n\n-The first is having a NPC stay out of the players sight and set up traps and move things around since the player would assume it's just the games programming. Works well with doll enemies as well since they can just stay still when the players in the room.\n\n- Second is an invisible NPC that reacts to what the player interacts with and moves around the house opening and closing doors etc. \n\n- third is a monster the player has to hide from however I've seen games like this already such as granny's house that was recently popular. \n\n-Forth, which is similar to the last, is a NPC that hides in the walls and secret passages. Funnily enough i saw recently that was pretty rad with basically the same concept. The npc would trigger things in the rooms players are in as well as changing the layout of the area by moving walls and so on.\n\nBased on the forth idea was a game where you were trapped in a maze type art exhibit with monochrome paintings with some brown colour as the focus. You'd come across another character in the maze who splits ways with you but when you go back to them the rooms gone and there's a new painting this time with red instead of brown."
8rp8qo,Quick replay,"Not a full game idea but a feature a lot of games could benefit from.\n\nWhen you launch a game and load from a save, show a quick, sped up recap of what you did last time.\n\nPlaying the God Of War and I cannot sink as much time as I would like, so my gaming sessions are like 2-3 hours every weekend. A 5-10 seconds video of key things I did last time that brought me to the current point would be really helpful."
8ro3zk,Village builder,"My idea is for a village builder that has mechanisms that I've never seen in a city builder game. While combat would play a small role, it is not the entire game unlike some other games (think clash of clans).\n\nYou would start with a few villagers and a small house, and grow from there. You can train your citizens in certain fields by sending them to nearby towns with schools, building your own schools, or having them work in a profession for a long period of time. Your citizens work in real time just like most city builders. This could be a single player or online game. I'm open to any constructive feedback, and though I cannot make the game myself, I would love to see it become a reality."
8rnclr,Survive and Flourish (Survival/Rpg),"I have always had this idea in my head of a survival game running through my head. Picture T-virus like zombie plague has consumed most of the world. Transforming people and various animals into dangerous creatures with one hell of an appetite. However, humanity has survived and managed to create sanctuaries that are safe from infection with no complete reclamation of the world in the foreseeable future. Your purpose is to survive against the dangers of the world from the infected, raiders, wildlife, and disease. Travel the world(s) and explore to see what your future holds.\n\nGameplay and Leveling\n\nUp to 4 players (Cooperative)\n\nFallout reminiscent controls\n\nSettlement building with NPC settlers (Defend, Farm, create income)\n\nLevel system 1-100 each level will give you Skill Points which will allow you to unlock certain skills (Craft certain items etc) perks would be at intervals of 5 levels\n\n30 or so total perks so you have to actually think about the perks you select.\n\nVehicles and modifications\n\nBiomes/Map/Santuaries\n\nBiomes- Urban/Suburan, Desert, Marsh/Swamp, Forest, Mountains, Tundra, Countryside/ Plains.\n\nMap- I think the scale i have would be too extensive for one map i think that it would be best if like in Fallout Far Harbor how you hop on a boat to go to another island there were ports that could ship you over the water to these other locations. to fit all the biomes so they aren't all just cramped together.\n\nSanctuaries- Cities that are friendly. Containing traders, and where you find most ""Contracts"" (missions). Have housing for sale/rent. some specialty cities will be ports, Military bases, etc."
8uls5r,"Colonizing, country building, world history, resource management, territory claiming type game","Alright, so I have this collection of ideas in my head that I think would make a fun game.\n\nSo first off, the point of the game is to build an empire.\n\n- you would start out and claim a piece of land for yourself and mark your claim on a map\n\n- claims can be recognized by other players, and claims could overlap creating “disputed territory”\n\n- disputed land could be solved through diplomacy, war, trade, or left unchallenged(a part of both countries)\n\n- you would have to manage resources in order to build up your colony. Building would need material in order to be built, but taking those materials hurts the environment which may hurt your food supply. Ex: cutting down a forest for lumber would mean no more hunting. \n\n- as your population grows, you would need more farm land to support it. Farm land requires territory, so you would need to claim more land, making disputed more likely. \n\n- going to war could mean mutual destruction, resources might get damaged and both societies might collapse.\n\n- new players could build in the ruins of old, creating a world history of events. \n\n- players can name places, rivers, mountains, lakes, bays, etc on the map, making them feel like real places that might outlive them even after they’re destroyed.\n\n- game would be in first person(except the map), hampering your ability to manage and from seeing the “bigger picture”. Building would be from a personal perspective, wars fought in first person.\n\n- alliances could be created, forming interconnected trade systems, some areas offering different resources than others.\n\n- on the map, the player decides on where his border is, what to include in terms of roads and resources and names, and what to name other players(ex: they may name players illegally building and trespassing in their lands “rebels” or “future citizens”\n\n- everything on the map is public, but everyone has a different map in terms of names, locations, and borders. Other players can “recognize” decisions made by other players, creating a “world map” that is full of everything that is recognized or disputed by the majority. Ex: the majority of the server recognizes a country’s territory, disregarding the one group the made a claim over sections of it. That smaller group is thus a rebel faction until such a time where they win over the territory and is recognized by other. This would prevent players from claiming the whole world, because nobody would recognize their claim, and everyone would be their enemy.\n\n- map would be large and randomly generated, but wouldn’t go on forever so that territory becomes limited over time.\n\n- players would choose on the map where to first spawn, and if they belong to an existing country. Their citizenship could also be recognized or dismissed by the leader of the country who can either be elected or enforced by whatever means the players prefer.\n\n- different political systems could be a reason for joining, destesting other countries. A dictatorship might be more effective than a democracy, but could also be prone to the weakness of the individual leader.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nI’m envisioning a mine craft level of creativity and randomly generated worlds, but with a resource system much more complicated than simply mining blocks. \n\nMaybe pre designed structures, but with terraforming of some kind. World world be in ancient to medieval period. Basically everything before guns. \n\nThe world is the most important thing. It would have to be designed in a way that inspires people to build in certain places and fight for it. Think of what attractes people to build in certain places in mine craft for example.\n\nI keep mentioning mine craft, but would rather not see the game voxel based. Just using it as an example of a natural environment that players can change.\n\n\n\n"
8uk24a,Help me with my Development of a cult game,"Hi!   \nLike the title says, I need ideas for gameplay of my cult game. You will be able to   \nmake your own cult, choose a name, choose a logo and grow your cult as huge as possible.  \nNotes: It will be multiplayer and no pay to win elements  \nI want a good presentation of progression, maybe with a never ending growing cult or a tech tree. I want that new players have the possibilty to win against experienced players. I want that the game can be played with different strategies. Pacifist cult, agresive cult (Think ISIS), enlightenment thru wisdom path,... I have many ideas but I just don't know what is good because everything I come up with will not be satisfying enough or will be hard for other players.  \nThe multiplayer aspect can be 1v1vAI or 2v2 or 1v1v1v1, you will be able to make alliances that can be broken.  \nNow my question: any ideas? It can be controversional with my ideas.  \nThank you very much  \nSincerely,  \nWardergrip"
8uiggn,Business/Factory Tycoon,"Hi all\n\nI have an idea for an amusing tycoon type game. You basically take control of a company and your primary goal is to reach profit targets, which when you do, unlocks new features.\n\nYou have to manage the office/factory in real time and deal with issues such as staff absence, disciplinary meetings, hiring new team members, team meetings, creating rules and helping your workforce stay positive and productive.\n\nYou will be challenged by unionizing workers, disruptive individuals, rubbish recruitment agencies, bad press, staff fights, riots over poor office coffee, equipment breaking down etc.\n\nDynamics such as:\n\n\- Staff morale, keep it high or staff productivity will fall. A workforce with low morale won't make as much or do as much work as a workforce with high morale, and your ability to meet demand will suffer.\n\n\- Supply &amp; Demand. This fluctuates over time and whilst it might appear innocuous at first, keep an eye on it, because you don't want to have a sudden spike in demand when you have a 3 day walk out by staff over pay and conditions.\n\n\- Wage budgets - manage them carefully or face having to lay staff off which lowers morale.\n\n\- Cyber Attacks - its not a case of if, but when. Be prepared to keep staff morale high when this happens, and also keeping the press at bay. Make sure you pay your anti-cyber team well, or they will get sloppy and cost you dearly!\n\nYou will also get scenarios that come up where you will be given a choice that will affect the long term game. For example, one of your top executive staff members who is a serial winner in the sales team gets accused of harrasment by another staff member. Do you investigate, spend time and resources and deal with a potentially explosive situation, or brush it under the carpet and take a chance that it all blows over? The decisions you take in game will also affect your reputation as a business owner - get caught ignoring accusations and favoring senior staff members and your reputation will take a battering, which will make it harder to hire young talent for the workforce. \n\nResist hostile takeover attempts! The longer you hold out against a takeover bid, the lower staff morale will get, but if you can hold your nerve, you will come out the other side with a stronger team mentality and higher productivity as a result. \n\nPromote or fire staff at will! Feel a staff member isn't pulling their weight? Are their sales or productivity numbers down for the year? Up to you, you can give them a warning or just give them the bad news straight away. Be aware though, that dismissing/promoting/disciplining staff has an effect on morale and company image. Fire too many people and you get a reputation as being a hire/fire company and staff will be reluctant to join and may demand higher wages/contract clauses\n\nThoughts everyone? (first time poster)"

8uegew,Cool Watch Dogs 3 Cop Idea I Made,"Watch dogs 3 Wanted System idea\n\nStage 1 regular cops come after you tasers, batons, fists, and trying to arrest you. Passive police car chases. Mostly city/ Highway patrol and county cops.\n\nStage 2 State and regular cops. Armed with M4s and shotguns along with pistols. They still try to arrest you but they can shoot. More aggressive police chases PITs roadblocks and ramming. Also they have body armor.\n\nStage 3 2x more state and regular cops with a chopper chasing you. The cops don’t arrest you no longer and they have attachments on their weapons. \n\nStage 4 Swat gets involved. They get a chopper with a machine gunner on the side. They can carry automatic pistols and submachine guns along with shotguns and more ARs. They have riot vans along with suvs that they drive. Now 2x more cops than stage 3.\n\nStage 5 The FBI gets involved they have same weapons as swat and police. But they get a chopper with a sniper and fast undercover cars to chase you. They can do parkour and run almost as fast as you. They also have the ability to shutdown electronic devices in the area making you unable to hack. 1.5x more cops than stage 4. The FBI are the main villain of the story.\n\nStage 6 National Guard gets called in. The have military weapons. Grenades and gas grenades as well. They’ve also got humvees also with a Minigun Variant. Tanks, APCs and attack and support transport choppers with mini guns on the side. The NG can call in a corvette boat along with fighter jets that can booming run you and fight you in the skies. They have better armor than swat or FBI. The NG can shut down electronics as well.  Regular police no longer respond.\n\nStage 7 The final stage. The Special forces respond they are basically the same as the National Guard but they have more stuff. Like Prototype Military Jets, Tanks, helicopters, and boats. Special forces has access to a Navy Destroyer. With an AC-130 and juggernaut suits. State cops no longer respond.\n"
8ue14n,Action/Adventure Game Set In An Abandoned School,"I'm just going to flair this intermediate because I have no idea how difficult it would actually be to make.\n\nSynapsis:\n16 year-old girl Jamie wakes up in a school, with no memory or recollection of how she got there. She soon meets someone called Guy, who provides her shelter in the school. However, sinister things are happening unbeknownst to them, and they quickly realise that the fate of the entire world is in their hands. They’ll have to uncover the mysteries of the school, defeat hordes of zombies and other creatures, and ultimately, save the planet from total destruction.\n\nPlot:\n16 year old-girl wakes up in a school, with no memory or recollection or how she got there. A guy called Guy tells her that he saved her life. He's been living in this abandoned school for years in complete isolation, and is happy that he's no longer alone.  He pits her against a training course he created (tutorial) to test out her skills. She succeeds and he welcomes her to the school. They quickly learn that a horde of zombies are attacking the school, and they try their best to stop them. Guy realises that their attempts are futile, and sends Jamie into another dimension (which just so happens to be another school) to steal an artefact which can kill the zombies. The keepers of the dimension don't take kindly to visitors (first boss), and try to kill Jamie. She escapes with the artefact and Guy used it to wipe out the zombies. They then notice a strange alien known as the Wugahumpfdatron is planning to wipe out all life on Earth, and they work to stop it, but it doesn't work. They realise that a creature known as the King Zombie is creating more, and they work to stop him. Annoyed, the King Zombie decides to attack them (second boss), but they defeat him. Meanwhile, the Wugahumpfdatron opens up a portal to their dimension and sends their army to destroy the school. Guy sends Jamie to the other dimension to steal another artefact which can kill the Wugahumpfdatron's army. The keepers of the dimension try to kill her again (third boss), but she succeeds again. Guy powers up the artefact and wipes out the army, but the Wugahumpfdatron is still alive, and now they must beat it before it wipes out the entire world (final boss). They succeed, and Jamie agrees to stay in the school until she can find somewhere else to go, and they get started on repairing the school.\n\nBosses:\n1st boss - Levi:\nLevi has a pistol, and will attempt to shoot the player. Three shots and it's game over. The player must hide behind a table, and then sneak up on Levi and attack him. Do this twice and the first phase is over. Levi will then have two pistols and the player must do the same thing again. Do this twice and the second phase is over. Levi will then put on a jet-pack and fly around the room while attempting to shoot the player with a sniper rifle. The player must throw a chair at his jet-pack to destroy it and then run to attack him quickly. Do this twice and the final phase is over.\n\n2nd boss - King Zombie:\nThe King Zombie will tear apart bits of the room and throw them at the player. Get hit three times and it's game over. The player must keep dodging them until a large block falls from the ceiling which they can climb. Then they must jump onto the King Zombie and punch him in the face multiple times (mash a button). Do this once and the first phase is over. Some of the floor will collapse, and the player must do the same thing again. Do this once and the second phase is over. Even more of the floor will collapse, and the player must do the same thing again (but the King Zombie is more aggressive and throws more frequently). Do this once and the final phase is over.\n\n3rd boss - Levi (2nd fight):\nLevi has used the artefact on himself and is now invincible. The player must dodge his laser attacks until he accidentally blows up the entire school. The player must jump on the remains of the school and dodge even more lasers. Levi will get tired and the artefact's power will drain. The player must then jump to Levi and attack him quickly. Do this three times and the fight is over.\n\nFinal boss - Wugahumpfdatron:\nThe Wugahumpfdatron will fly above the player and constantly swoop down to attack them. When it flies down the player must jump onto it and climb to the front (they must hold on when the Wugahumpfdatron flies upside down or they will fall off and die). They must then punch the Wugahumpfdatron in the eye multiple times (mash a button). Do this three times and the first phase is over. The player must then run away from the Wugahumpfdatron as it chases them through the school. The player will reach a section where they will climb up, and pieces of the ceiling will fall down on the Wugahumpfdatron's eye. Do this three times and the second phase is over. Now the player will chase the Wugahumpfdatron through the school while avoiding the flicks of its tail. The Wugahumpfdatron will suddenly turn around and the player must dodge the laser coming out of its eye. They must then punch the Wugahumpfdatron in the eye multiple times (mash a button). Do this three times and the final phase is over.\n\nThanks for reading everyone! These are all the ideas I have at the moment, but more can be added :)"
8udzdi,A hack n slash/tps mix game,"I've had an idea of a game that plays like a hack n slash,the weapons the player can use are melee weapons and firearms,so the game would play kinda like DMC,but you can also switch from an hack n slash mode to a tps mode gameplay. Basically the player normally uses his melee weapons to slash enemies and his firearms to shoot them with a autoaim (again,similiar to DMC),but he can also press the aim button to switch to tps mode and aim at enemies when they are too far or when he just feels like it."

8uc7uc,Survival rpg with an insanity meter,"I’m not sure if the insanity mechanic has been  explored and the background may seem cliche but fuck it lol. \n\nYou start out as a average person who’s plane was shot down by an unknown force on an island that’s much more technologically advanced than at first glance. There’s an extra emphasis on your character being average. They can barely handle a gun. The weapons sways heavily and recoil makes it impossible to get rapid successes shots off. Some guns will simply be unusable from the start due to their recoil. However, characters can become better at using the weapons over time by using said weapon type, similar to the elder scrolls. There would be 5 different combat trees: long guns, small guns, block, stealth, and melee, with branches for the respective subcategory in every tree. Characters will also have trees for hunting, gathering, cooking, and clothes making(forgot the name of this lol). If a character commits too much violence from the start, their insanity will begin to fill up, causing the character to have nightmares, hallucinations, and be paranoid in their dialogue. Once the insanity bar completely fills up, the character goes insane, and it’s game over, leaving you to start back from an earlier point. Since the world is unleveld, this keeps the character from wondering into higher level areas and getting absolutely stomped. The way to counter this is to start slow, only hunting animals and keeping violent rampages to a minimum as to allow your character to become hardened to the cruelties of the island. The character can also lower their insanity by talking to NPC’s, reading, resting, and establishing a base for food, water, and shelter. The island may seem like a cliche survival game at first. But as you explore the island, you unravel its secrets through item descriptions, letters, notes, books, and npc dialogue, and find a much deeper and darker story underneath.\n\nAgain, the idea is very cliche, and the insanity meter’s probably been done, but I thought I’d give my take on a “morrowind meets far cry” esque survival rpg."
8uc6zd,Puzzle Game based on a recent Reddit post of how enemies only appear when reloading.,"The concept is simple. It's an ironic game that is puzzle based where the objective is to take out all the current enemies.\n\nThe main idea is that the enemies will be invisible (maybe they'll try to kill you, maybe they won't, who knows). The only time enemies appear is when you cannot attack them. I.E, you will have to reload, switch weapons, be in the process of pulling the pin on a grenade and throwing it, run out of ammo. Not being able to shoot while running, and enemies appearing then. Basically anything that typically happens in FPS's in which it is the most inconvenient moment for an enemy to appear. \n\nYou have to try and kill all of the enemies by throwing grenades before hand, shooting bullets (which are slower than usual so you can try and kill enemies within shooting and making them appear. Using the environment would also assumingly be an option.\n\nCould be an app, could be a website game. Though app would be better considering it tends to get way more popular than website games."
8uarbo,Street fighting game with old singers,"I need this game in my life. Imagine a game that stars singers from the 1940s-80s; for example, Frank Sinatra vs Elvis Presley in their prime fighting in a jazz bar with street fighting rules. Their songs would play in the background and whoever was winning, their song would play loudly. They would have special moves depending on who they are and would each have a finishing move. The singers would also have to talk shit to one another while fighting. Players would also be able to use their environment to their ability. For example, smashing glass bottles from the bar on their head, or putting someone’s head into the piano and smashing it down. Some other characters I would like to see would be The Dupree’s, James Brown, Tony Bennet, Ray Charles, The Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, Michael Jackson, Etc. What do you guys think? "

8u962z,Three rival factions,"I am  considering a 2.5d game where you roam around on a map exploring and  doing various quests for people you meet. The core of the story is that  alien artifacts are discovered, and it quickly becomes obvious that it  is some kind of portal. I am considering having three factions which the  player can work for. A science faction, where you gather research  material (fetch quests), who figure out how to use the artifact as one-way gateway for them to reach another dimension. A religious cult  faction, who worship the aliens and see the artifact as one-way doorway  to bring the aliens back here to rule over everyone. The player would do  various fetch quests for them to gain XP and trust. And finally a  military faction who see the situation as a threat, and want to destroy  the artifact before it can be activated. Missions within this faction  would be mostly target elimination and escorts.  The main story and  atmosphere in the game will come from the friction between these  factions as they draw nearer their goal of opening or destroying the  portal.\n\nThe player should be able to  level up in each faction in any order, unlocking more quests and story,  but for the endgame, I'd force the player to either open the incoming  portal, travel through the outgoing portal, or destroy the dangerous,  divisive thing completely.\n\nMost of the  map would be available to the player at all times, but perhaps certain  important areas are locked unless you have very high faction standing.  The enemies would spawn randomly, which makes it easy enough to increase  the difficulty and weaponry if you choose to side with the military,  turning it more into a combat game. Siding with the other factions will  produce more of an exploration game where you get led into remoter areas  of the map. Technically, the player is a vehicle which docks with  outposts/towns/cities and uses a bulletin board with news and quests,  depending on the faction levels. Most of the progression and quests  would therefore not require major art asset work, just text writing.\n\nWhat  do you think? I've never considered a game like this before and wonder  if the core idea is good, and rich enough to drive stories and provide  material for quests and sidequests etc. I don't think the technical  parts are too difficult or a crazy amount of work, since the map and  main gameplay of going around between locations won't change much, just  spawning the opposing factions as enemies, but feedback is very much  welcomed :)\n\n Military is easy, but how to create a different feel between the scientists and the cultists? I'd especially appreciate suggestions on balancing the factions in some kind of rock-paper-scissors way, while providing some different play styles."

8u6l7l,A simplified D&amp;D Quest game,"I've been thinking about this concept for a while but I thought that I'd put it on here to see what you guys think about it. Please note that I don't want to give too many of my concepts for this game away as it could lead to out-right copies of this game idea, but if anyone is wanting to ask any more questions I am more than willing to answer some :)\n\nThe basic idea is that you play against other players (could be either AI or other people) to receive quest points from finishing quests. The game can have different ways of winning, from either time-based finishes to the first to get ""X"" Quest points.\n\nFrom finishing these quests, you can gain ability points to spend on your character (i.e Strength, Speed) to help you out in more difficult yet rewarding quests. You can also unlock items to help you such as weapons or armor to buff your characters stats as well. \n\nThe scenery is set up like a board game, with hexagonal tiles that have unique properties assigned to them such as terrain buffs or monster spawns.\n\nThe combat is set up much like D&amp;D, with different types of dice used for different weapons and turns used so to simulate this concept even more.\n\nThe main focus of this game is to create a game easy enough for a 9 year old to learn, but with enough variety and surprise to make it a challenge for even master tacticians to be intrigued. And humor, plenty of humor!\n\nThis idea has inspirations from armello, and I truly think that this type of genre has huge potential for the future.\n\nLink to armello: http://armello.com/ "
8u64er,"A challenging platformer without death and checkpoints. Instead, enemies and hazards knock you back down.","Remember how in old-school NES games like *Castlevania* or *Ninja Gaiden*, enemies would knock you back and possibly into a death pit? Imagine a game like *Super Meat Boy* or *Celeste*, except hazards could send you further down the game world and forcing you to climb back up. No death. No checkpoints.\n\nSometimes I think of video game stories from the perspective of the surviving character. Link at the end of Breath of the Wild never died. All my deaths leading up to the ending aren't canon.\n\nThis is what bothers me about challenging platformers. The lesson/moral of those brutal platformers is ""perseverance through adversity."" But if you can just die and retry, it takes away from that lesson. The player just retries as if the death never happened, and Meat Boy/Madeline never even knew they died. Ever. Those failures weren't part of the story.\n\nBut what if we get rid of death?\n\nImagine falling into a death pit, except instead of dying, you fall through to the previous level. And if you don't react quickly enough, you could fall even further to the level before that too. It's like *Super Meat Boy/Celeste* with the penalty system of *Getting Over It*.\n\nThe character and the player both feel despair at the same time. The story of how you beat the game *is* the story of how the character finished his story. Every huge fall made you want to give up are the same falls that almost broke the main character.

8u4shy,Banzai,"A war game where your normal guns are weaker than the enemies, but your short-explosives are more effective, and death is just a minor inconvenience (you don't lose items nor progress in thegame by dying), so the main strategy is to run up to the enemy and blow yourself up at them, and then respawn and get back into the battle.\n\nThe game doesn't track how many times you die, only if your team wins the battle. Or maybe it even rewards you for the number of times you die before winning.\n\nCould take place on the Japanese side of the Pacific War, and have planes and ships/subs you can drive in addition to being infantry."

8u0fkf,Low priority mail / Road trip game,"A game where you deliver low priority packages across a large open world. The main pull would be to look at the cool environment. Something where you can turn on some music and zone out. You would never leave the vehicle, or the road so the open world doesn't need to be fully fleshed. \n\nThe meat is the aesthetics and environment. A low poly art style would look interesting, and help keep development time down a bit. There would be a variety of environments like cities, farmland, forests, mountains, and small towns. There could also be references, like a strawberry field, or a mystery shack. The traffic would also vary between all these places, from heavy to none at all. There would also be day and night cycle, and a weather cycle, that things like street lights, and buildings would be affected by.\n\nThe driving would be low stress, because the point isn't really to drive. speed is limited to the speed limit, which changes between highway and local roads. The delivery truck would have driver assist type features, lane keeping, automatic breaking, and a toggle-able auto-pilot mode. If you try to go off road the automatic break kicks in. Basically you can't crash at all.\n\nYou would have multiple delivery and pickup locations that are spread across the map, and you can pick whichever one to go to. Pickup gives you a few of packages so you always have choices of where to go, you would hopefully have around 5-10 packages at a time. Delivering packages would give you points you can spend on cosmetic items for your truck.There would also be gas and food meters. Though gas and food wouldn't cost anything. This would help add variety to the driving and add to the road trip feel. If you do run out of gas or food you wait a minute (actually 60 seconds) for triple A to send you a gas/food truck and then you carry on your way. Though you could have the option to turn the meters and the packages off and just explore."

8tzgnr,Soaked- A neighborhood water gun and balloon battle royale with clothes drying mechanics and more,"Setting: A peaceful Midwest USA suburban neighborhood during a particularly warm Mid-1990’s summer day.\n\nConcept: Everybody in the neighborhood is participating in this massive water fight. \n\nGimmick: Your saturation meter is your health bar. You will slowly dry off again over time. Remaining in direct sunlight (and direct visibility) will dry you off faster. Finding a dry towel and using it (like a first aid kit) will dry you off even more. There are also stationary fans that will dry you off very quickly. If your saturation meter hits 100%, you’re out of the game.\n\nYou also have stamina- you will get tired and exhausted, so you’ll need to grab a Squeeze-It juice bottle to refresh yourself and maybe a freshly cooked hotdog from near the grill.\n\nMap confinement: As the game goes on, the lawn sprinkler systems starting at the outer perimeter begin to turn on, forcing you toward the center and reducing the size of the playable area.\n\nWeapons: \nYou have your basic and rudimentary single pump water pistol that delivers one small squirt per trigger pull. Not very effective but better than nothing. \n\nThen you have the charge-up power soaker- a two handed water gun with an air tank that you pump up which allows you to fire continuously until the air pressure runs out. There are an array of these, some have larger water reservoirs, some require less pumps to charge, some have bigger streams but run out of air and water quickly, some fire thinner streams but last longer. \n\nThere are water balloons as well, you can carry a few in your pouch. These are sufficient for a pretty good soaking with a direct hit, but also cause, ahem, “splash damage” if you only hit near your target.\n\nThere are also mounted guns- I mean, garden hoses that you can use for an unlimited amount of time, but you won’t be able to travel far with them. \n\nYou will need to refill your water weapons as they run out of water. For this, you need to visit a water source such as a garden hose, water bucket, or unground pool. The pool is the fastest way but it comes with an added danger- if another player sees you kneeling down to fill your weapon, they can run up and shove you into the water. In a pinch, you can also transfer water from one weapon to another- though you are likely to spill a small percentage of water in the process.\n\nThe match ends when there is one player left with less than 100% saturation, or when the street lights come on and all remaining players are called home by their moms- in which case the driest player wins.\n\n"
8txszy,I would love to see some ultra realism.,"so a wooden table won't protect you from bullets, a high calibre rifle penetrates most thing but thick concrete or steel armour. Permanent wounds and almost 1 hit KO's, with headshots doing less damage then body shots (some pistols irl can't even shoot through the skull). if it's dystopian and resources are scare, you should have to buy magazines and clips as well as bullets and you can throw half used clips to refill new ones, so you can get awesomely stressful scenes where you have to hide behind cover and pull bullets out of old clips to try and refill your gun. Gun noises, flashes and sounds correctly, irl you see the flash, hear the bullet, then hear the gun which in most games and movies is all done at the same time. some really good ai would also be amazing, calling out to each other and using tactics ""he's behind that wall, Imma flank his left, cover me"" sort of deal, theres so many way you could make this ultra realistic, and I believe that making it this hard would be awesome, cos it's not even a scummy hard like knockback loops and bullet sponges, but rather a genuinely realistic difficulty.

8tgrbo,"Jackel &amp; Hyde, a game about mutations, groups of mythology hunters and split personalitys","Alright so this is an idea that has been floating around in my head for awhile of a RPG like mass effect, lots of talking and combat with skills that help with combat.\n\nThis idea also takes inspiration from Vampyr when it comes to dialogue and from  classic literature such as Dr Frankenstein, Dracula, werewolves and an alternative form of Windigo's and uses the ""conflict between man and monster""\n\nThe basic premise is that you are Dr Jekyll that is working on chemical improvements to britsh soldiers while while stationed at a british base , only a surprise attack from the enemy happened causing an unfinished formula to enter his body (the attack was directed at his lab injuring Jekyll, formula entered through wounds).\n\nReturning to London because of his injuries allowing the formula to develop and mutate Jekyll and give him a split personality of Hyde, who will tempt him into Embrace he monster side (much like the darkness) but the player is never forced into this form,\n (execpt when it's shown so the player can play around this form when cornered by thugs, that how I would show it off anyway)\n\nHyde's appearance is different then Jekyll's, while Jekyll is a small and weak looking individual Hyde is twice his size, not burly but lanky almost taking a gorilla body shape, long arms, short legs.\n\nThis form is a combat focused form, with vary agile movement (not vertical, execpt for a pounce attack) a wide mouth with sharp teeth and strong claws and above human strength allows this form to more then enough to take on common thugs of London.\n\nNow I understand what your thinking ""wow this form seems so great why would I want to change back or never use this form?"" Well that is because of the personality gauge, it shows who is the dominant personality, this effects your dialogue options, \n\nHyde is an aggressive creature who likes to take problems head on with disregard for others, if he is dominant then his personality will effects Jekyll's form when in conversation.\n\nJekyll himself likes to keep things peaceful and thinks about his problems, though his service in the military means that he is not complete defenseless and he can fight, it's just slower with melee weapons and guns.\n\nOf course dialog can effect the personality gauge as well, making agressive remarks or not caring innocent people will cause Hyde to gain more control and in turn his combat effectiveness increases as well, same with Jekyll.\n\nOver all plot is that Jekyll will encounter other creatures such as Frankensteins monster (and the Dr himself) werewolves, vampires and a two human factions those who hunt these creatures Van Hellsing style and those who help these creatures and studies them.\n\nWith the help of the reasurchers Jekyll finds out that he has become, in a sense, a juvenile Windigo, only that the unnatural way he became one means he doesn't fallow the same rules ( a mission can be given to have him be sent to a Windigo den and depending on which side, Jekyll or Hyde, the player has taken, the Windigo's ether attack or communicate)\n\nWhen it comes to the world Jekyll will wander from the streets of London to the countryside of Ireland in the 1800's\n\nEncountering mythical monsters along the way.\n\n\nSo that's my idea."

8t7oyn,FPS with RTS Elements,"Hey, I'm a computer science and occasional gamer and I got to thinking about how much I miss classic playing real time strategy games such as Age of Empires, Command and Conquer, Age of Mythology against my friends. I'm adept at c++, (I've been focusing primarily on machine learning), so I imagine learning the basics of game development shouldn't be too hard. \n\n**Core ideas**\n\n* Primarily a multiplayer game with AI military (First person RTS) Units and vehicles.\n* Combing RTS strategy elements seamlessly within an FPS framework. The goal is too add strategic elements without it being overwhelming in the first person (I.e. no micro managing). APM (Actions per minute) shouldn't solely determine how good a player is.\n   * One really cool idea I have is to create a **trench style warfare game** played in a 1v1 (3v3, 5v5, later) multiplayer match. Each side would have some amount of trenches with the objective being to take out the enemies HQ. AI Units can be upgraded, bought, (think like RTS strategy), but with a simplified system of unit control. Units will automatically fill in the current trench position. (Also certain defense units will automatically stay behind i.e snipers). The player controlling the units can only issue commands to all the units in a trench. The commands would be attack or retreat. Also. players would be able to order in airstrikes, artillery, etc... and possibly upgrade defenses and deploy traps (on a simple 2D quick map). There would be many more systems in place to balance things out of course.\n   * A team/player income system similar to MOBA's (League of legends). Income would be spent on A) Player weapons, unit upgrades, special abilities).\n   * Special abilities (air strike, artillery strike etc..) should give the enemy player a heads up. For example, using an airstrikes requires throwing a beacon that produces smoke, a laser pointer which can be seen in game, or maybe an in game sound notification like hearing airplanes far away).\n   * Battle map wouldn't be massive but anywhere from 25-75 AI units. (Tech Talk:  I have some ML ideas that might be useful to drive large local AI battles that's outcome can be verified on the back-end without fully keeping track of AI units)\n   * Each game should take around 15-25 minutes.\n   * Player's can re-spawn into any unit after a set amount of time. Maybe there is not specific player character. The player can just pop into any unit after waiting a delay depending on the length of the game.\n* Basically, I want to add strategic elements to FPS, but also show the chaos of war. When you decided to issue the attack command your character as well as all your units start climbing the trench walls to meet a wall of gunfire, explosions etc... \n* Trenches will be a spread out further and further as you get closer to the enemies HQ. So its hard to take trenches near enemies HQ. At the same time the trenches in the middle can seesaw back and forth as players attack each other.\n* As you gain more levels outside of the game mode you can unlock new units, weapons, vehicles, abilities, etc... while keeping things balanced.\n\nThat's all I got for now! Lemme know if anyone has any ideas, suggestions, or changes. "
8t6p1j,Looking for feedback on a weapon design,"The basis of the weapon is that it is a combination of two different weapons: a long-barrel, very high caliber revolver and two blades attached to the users feet that extend from the toes.\n\nHow the weapon functions is that the player primarily attacks with the foot blades, but revolver shots can be incorporated mid combo. The weapons promote whittling down the enemy and fluidly jumping between different enemies and quickly executing them with the revolver. As you deal enough damage with the foot blades, you will then tag that enemy. If the user then aims at that enemy for a second or two, a special reticle will be shown and the user will then unload all remaining bullets into the tagged opponent. Additionally, the player can tag multiple opponents and, as long as they are all within line of sight, unload all shots evenly into the tagged enemies.\n\nI do really like the revolver and the tagging mechanic though I'm not sold on the foot blades. I would like to keep the revolver as a revolver and not some form of hybrid weapon and something more unique than just a sword paired with the revolver would be nice. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated."
8t6duq,Automatilyptica - a post-automation survival game,"It is the year 2413. Everything in the world has been fully automated, and the need for social interaction has been completely eliminated. Unexpected face-to-face encounters with other people are practically unheard of, if not downright avoided, and practically all communication is electronic. There is no true A.I. behind any of it, at most there are exceptionally complex automata serving in capacities such as doctors and law enforcement, everything is being ran by completely dispassionate systems which are expected to fulfill your every possible request. Travel is arranged through the use of driverless cars via automated highways. Banking is completely electronic. Food production is entirely automated, as is gathering, processing, sale, and delivery. Society in general still exists, though noone is exactly certain as to how much of it is functional, as it is completely concealed in a system designed to protect the occupants from unwarranted interaction or intrusion.  \n\n\nAs the protagonist explores, they find that there are indications of abandonment to some extent in nearly every direction. The streets are essentially large sidewalks, as the little traffic there is has been performed via elevated highway for decades now, and they are completely devoid of activity. For those businesses which require a personal presence, they are accessed from the highways, otherwise all services are delivered straight to the residences.  \n\n\nTheir problem?  \n\n\nThey have fallen out of the system. There is no legal record of anything from birth onward, and there are no matches or identifiers for them in any database, anywhere. They have nothing and no ties to anyone. Whatever they may remember is irrelevant, as there is only one way into the system, and there is only one way out. Their options for survival are limited, and shrinking.\n\nLiving outside of the system will be incredibly difficult, and scrounging might be the only possible means of survival at first. Simply accessing a grocery store is ridiculous, noone has visited one in-person for years, and they are more or less factories where the product is delivered directly to the customer. There is no easy way to communicate with a live person, especially for someone who doesn't have a bank account, which is the commonly accepted form of ID. How will they possibly survive, much less re-enter the system?  \nBrute force and criminal behavior might be an option. Perhaps an opportunity arises to perform some hacking, or you get lucky and find a logic loophole somewhere. Maybe the self-sufficient could even manage to eke out a living on the outskirts of civilization, eschewing the system entirely. Could the clever find out how to trick their way past the automated systems? Who knows?!?  \n\n\nBut, what really -is- the story here? Why did they get kicked out of the system? Why is everything automated to suspiciously efficient levels? Where is everyone, or are they even still here? How can everyone be completely oblivious of their neighbors (or lack thereof)? Is there perhaps a downside to the system?\n\nThese questions, and the many more which gameplay will bring forth, will not be easily answered..."
8t65cv,If Tekken 6's Secenario Campaign Did it Better,"I think it was very poorly done, but had great potential. One of the main issues is that you had a ""lock-off"" button rather than a ""lock-on"" button. On top of that, I was thinking how there could be more games that tries to do an action/fighting game with traditional fighting game mechanics. When you're not locked on, it's like every other action game with 3D directional attacks, but when locked on, the controls become more like a fighting game. To balance this, there would be a mechanic where when locked on, blocking correctly doesn't have you take damage, but when not locked on, you have auto-guard but take very little chip damage (since you can't crouch/low-guard), mainly to avoid having both a block button and having to hold back. Of course, when you attack, you take full damage, so auto-guard isn't really preferred, especially to do more technical stuff. Also, special moves, which require motions, require you to be locked on. Because of the fighting game controls, locking on always has your camera at an angle like Scenario Campaign in Tekken 6, making it easier to mentally conform to left and right, but still enough to see ahead of yourself. Of course, this means that objects will also be transparent to see your character clearly to keep the camera angle relevant."

8xp2rs,Combine Watchdogs and the Crew into one world (hear me out),"So Ubisoft have had some moderate success with both titles, but both have a shared complaint, of the worlds feeling a bit dead, so my thought was something a bit different, and to my knowledge has never been done before in gaming.\n\n**Buy Watch\_Dogs 3**\n\nGame is fully equipped, taking place across a few cities in Europe. Let's say London, Paris and Milan are the 3 focal cities. You play the game in the open world, do missions as you normally do, inside little instances, and go about the game as normal. The open world parts though are in the same shared world as people playing The Crew 3, so there are people racing around inside your Watch\_Dogs 3 world when you are out exploring.\n\n**Buy The Crew 3**\n\nGame again is fully equipped, taking place across the EU cities, and linked together by the same procedurally generated roads in the Crew 2. You can use Boats, Planes, Cars, all the other vehicles, and explore out in the open world, and see people running about doing their hacking thing in Watch\_Dogs 3. The open world sections are vulnerable to hacking though, which means you can be hacked as part of crossover missions, but you can also escape detection as part of your Crew missions.\n\nBoth games have complaints that the open worlds are a bit dead and boring, and this would fix that issue simultaneously, as well as adding a tonne of new layers to both games. The same could happen with things like Hearthstone and WoW, where people in WoW will come across NPC's in taverns playing the game, but you can actually see the gameplay, and it's a randomly selected pair playing out there in the world, or heck, even something like EvE Online, could launch an FPS which you can go and spectate in your EVE ship, as it's actually taking place on the planets in the same universe.\n\nAm I crazy, or is this a really cool idea?"

8xgrlp,A game about rebuilding earth after being destroyed by a meteor strike.,"Being an aspiring game dev, I have thought of some concepts that are more just ""that's sounds cool"" rather than ""dream project"" and this is one of them.\n\nThe game will take place withing the near future. Astrologists have discovered a meteor the size of Ceres is heading towards earth and is expected to hit within the next few decades. During this time, the UN authorize the construction of ""The Ark"" which is series of underground cities within the earth's crust that are capable of keeping humanity safe from a meteor impact and are also designed to withstand the increase in temperature the meteor impact would cause. The Ark would be capable of also allowing habitats for all species of plants &amp; animals on earth to maximize preservation. The Ark would be a network system with massive underground cities across the earth with multiple smaller cites and communities dotted around. [Here is an example of what The Ark would look like. red outlines are major cities, dots are communities, and blue lines are tunnels that connect them all.](https://imgur.com/a/108oV2r)\n\nThe Ark is completed, life on earth is preserved, and earth ends up a giant fireball. Humanity then spends the next centuries waiting for the earth to cool down and be habitable once again. Life continues on as normal as it can, but crime and war is minimal as humanity knows very well that any conflict that could lead to the Ark being destroyed is not worth fighting.\n\nHundreds of years later, humanity has finally stepped out of the Ark to see the desolate wasteland that was once home. The Player is then tasked with rebuilding the earth. They would have to reconstruct habitats, fill the oceans, adjust temperature, build settlements, and do general terraforming with the end goal being a reborn earth.\n\nThat's really all I can say for now since this is just a rough concept. What do you guys think and what would you ad to this concept?"
8xe2bm,A survival game set in the No Man's Land of World War I,"There were stories of soldiers in WW1 that fled into the no man's land, forming bands of deserters from all sides. They lived in abandoned trenches and scavenged supplies off the corpses produced by failed assaults. I think this would make a rich and unique survival game.\n\nPlayers would have to content with the regular threats of starvation and thirst, as well as the side effects of war like artillery strikes, clouds of poison gas moved by the wind, and infantry charges over the top. Scavenged supplies could be used to improve your trench home, while the mud and the rain simultaneously wore away at its walls."
8xdfz8,A survival/stealth game set in winter,"Rather than a survival game where you survive a zombie apocalypse or an alien invasion, the entire game is you surviving the winter and not getting caught by the enemy. You *can* collect food from digging up underground tree roots and mushrooms, collect water by digging through ice, and stay warm by huddling in caves, but these options take energy and time, and don't yield that much reward. NPC camps and cabins have a higher reward - higher quality food, burning fireplaces, water that you don't have to thaw - but carry the risk of being caught by NPCs, who you have no way of combating against besides running away.\n\nMy idea of the setting for this sort of game would probably have the player be a young nonhuman monster, like a yeti or a peryton, who starts the game on a snowy mountaintop and has to work their way down to the valley below. While you start foraging for food and warmth from nature, you eventually start sneaking around human camps and cabins which grow more common the further down the mountain you go."

8xb510,Against the System,So... this is a big one.\nA heavily story based game with some FPS elements.\nYou play as a SWAT member tasked with securing an abandoned construction site where terrorists are thought to be held up.\nYou discover a huge research facility and get taken down by an artificial intelligence hellbent on controlling the entire human race as their protector and God even if it means they lose their freedom.\nThis is story focused. I don't want next gen game play or graphics. I want this to be a thing. I know it's a long shot but I'll still try it.\nTo contact me on a small script and more details please email AlpackaHacka@gmail.com.
8xap3f,Silent hill inspired two part game.,"When up against a creature or place that manipulates peoples memories, minds, what if you played as a psychiatrist or someone who's at least aware of this and tried to save people? Recommended to either start the game with a different character or release a demo in order to introduce the concept.\n\nWith the set up of psychological horror there's a lot of room for interesting puzzles making a clear distinction between realistic ones such as a key being hidden inside a specific book and more put there puzzles like rearranging some statues to make a door unlock.\n\nThe possible drawback being that since you'll end up being an outsider for most of the experience the scares might seem like they're someone else's problem.\n\nThe levels, puzzles, and monster designs would be significant to the respective character with bits of information scattered around to help you figure out their stories."
8x82rg,A roguelike where the number you pick up from a killed monster determines how many moves you have to make before you can attack again,"Basically, whenever you kill an enemy, he drops an item with a number on it that you need to pick up. The number in the item tells you how many moves you have to make before you can kill another enemy.\n\nSo if you kill an enemy and the item he drops has a ""3"" on it, you need to move two tiles and in the third move, attack.\n\nIf you try to attack on the first or second moves, you won't be able to. If you make the 3 moves and didn't attack, the ""countdown"" of moves starts from ""3"" again, so you have to make another 2 moves to be able to attack on the third one."
8x79sz,The Mixed Confusion (nsfw game idea),"I have an idea of where gamers could enjoy an erotic horror game. Vr or not. It would be a simple game straight forward. The player would experience of viewing erotic like gameplay then hit the ground running with horror like elements. It could be reversed whichever way you like “erotic or horror”. I just want to create the idea of the player experiencing “fear boners”. I’m sick I know but, it’s an idea. "
8x758p,Game of everything (almost feasible),"Here’s my humble submission for a “game of everything”. The idea is not so much of a game, specifically, but a world relying on an API that connects already existing games. Developers could then share game results and other statistics with other existing games that could use them. Now, suspend your disbelief, and we’ll make the ultimate game of everything:\n\nThe first layer would be some existing strategy game, maybe in space, where civilizations or civilizations can invade others, etc. When one decides to invade another, the outcome is decided by a different game. Players of a warfare game would have a scheduled event, and the result of that match dictates the outcome in the first. It would be scheduled and the players would be the citizens of the invading and invaded civilizations. Their firepower could be balanced to mimic the relative power of the civilizations.\n\nNow, how could say a soccer or chess game connect with this world? Just like the players of warfare games could affect the destinies of their empires, so could others contribute to the culture and happiness of their own civilizations through their own performances.\n\nOne could potentially imagine all sorts of games connecting people in this world. After joining a civilization, people contribute to this world by the multiplayer games they enter and their results. Civilizations could also compete to attract players of specific games, in order to increase their power, etc."
8x6pwm,Baby drowning simulator [stealth/adventure game],"The game is essentially played as an erratic woman who is going to drown and get rid of her baby. Each erratic woman mission has a series of challenges (it's played a bit like splinter cell/metal gear solid) and sometimes you will have to outwit/murder your husband or get rid of the corpse.\n\nThe game is VR readyallowing a hands on approach and realistic baby squeeling.\n\nThe game has a multiplayer mode where all your friends can drown babies together in bathtubs, oceans or even a small forest stream."
8x5ec7,An interesting FPS game,"It takes place in an imaginary country called The Kingdom of Bunnycountry. Its people are anthropomorphic rabbits (no furry pls) and is ruled by a dictatorial king. It is very poor and crime ridden, which is breeding ground for revolution. There are 2 sides- Anti-government forces and pro-government forces. Smaller sub-factions may appear (Coyotestani Liberation Front, etc for anti gvt)(Police force for pro gov)\n\nThe game will be played semi-realistically, with headshots with any weapon an insta-kill, slower realoads, no GUI. The objective of the revolutionary forces is to push the RBA (Royal Bunni army) back to home base.\n\n•The catch•\nThe weapons of the revolutionaries are completely randomized. There are classes that you can pick that suit your preferred role (Rifleman, close quarters, fire support, morale support)\nThe RBA has a class system similar to RS2. As well, each weapon may have a random customization as a revolutionary. This may include having the stock sawed off of an AKM, an SKS with an AK receiver, etc.\n\nI will post more info later. Leave suggestions down below.\n\nAlso, don’t call me a furry, I hate them as much as you do."
8x4ey4,Routilikis Psyke: a rpg magic/steampunk mashup,"(the reason i am posting here is that a game like this would take me an infinity to make. i i am good at making lore and have a lot for this game but no acutal game coding exp)\n\nSo this game is supposed to be about the aforementioned character. This is a world where everybody has a 'twitch' a sort of change in there system where they can do something special. \n\nNow there is a group of people the 'brandless' (people without a twitch but also in a semi-cult)  are attacking people and murdering them.\n\nnow the protagonist a 'twichless'(just has no twitch) is attaked and his wife is killed. but as she dies he realized that he can absorb the powers of dead people. \n\nnow with his newfound powers he has to decide to either take the morale high ground, kill lots of people or live in a morale grey area.\n\nalso multipal endings"
8x32av,What Would You Do? Space Game Ideas,"I've had a fascination with open exploration games that take place in space. However, the concept seems like a very difficult task to accomplish.\n\nThe kind of game I'm referring to is a game where the player is dropped into a system of planets and other celestial bodies, and is given the freedom to explore and interact with the environment.\n\nI was wondering how, if given the task, would you guys tackle such an ambiguous and open ended game concept. Or maybe there are games out there that you think have done a great job in doing this exact idea?"

8wy8ck,Lego + MMORPG + Open World,"I realize that the title explains pretty much nothing.\n\nImagine a Lego game that you can play online with friends and other strangers. Pretty much like a Lego Elder Scrolls Online or Lego RuneScape. But instead of a fantasy-like setting, it's set in some parts of the world that are very popular (i.e., NY, LA, LV, London, Japan, etc...).\n\nInstead of giving hate for such a short post, add on to my idea down below, I'm always open to improvements. I'm on the road to being a game developer, my friend and I are both going to school for it."
8ww0i2,Fixing Battlefield V setting,"Since Battlefield 1, DICE clearly wanted Battlefield to bring back the theme of 'total war' and stay away from the modern military shooter genre that had been saturated the market, getting back to the series' roots to revitalize.\n\nHowever, they also wanted to include many elements of the modern military shooter, such as the character customization allows you to choose any gender and race, modernized weaponry and gears, over the top explosive actions, tactics, etc. Compromise is fine, but taking creative liberty to the point where the setting is indistinguishable is not. There's no reason to use historical setting unless you're going to be at least faithful to them or take advantages of that setting. Fans wanted the series to go back to the World War because they wanted it to look and play like World War.\n\nThere should be different solutions to this problem. The alternative which gives that old gritty WW2 feeling fans wanted, but makes sense of all the modernized additions contradicting the actual history. \n\nHere is my idea:\n\n*Iron Storm*, the FPS released in 2002, is a quite interesting example that while it is 'the World War 1' game, but presents the premise of 'what if the World War 1 never ended?"" In this alternative history, the Great War continued for half a century and the game takes place in 1964. And DICE could have gone with the setting similar to this type of alternative history.\n\nLet's say in this universe the hypothetical Battlefield V sets in, both *Operation Overlord* and *the Manhattan Project* **failed**, resulting in the constant stalemate. World War 2 dragged to the late 1940s. Allied and Axis powers spent all of their resources and couldn't sustain the war anymore. They sign the armistice, meaning the war didn't end technically, entering the cold war status. Instead of the real-life cold war between capitalist (US) and communist (USSR), it's the cold war between the fascist Axis (Germany/Italy/Japan) and the anti-fascist Allied (US/Britain/USSR).\n\nUnstable peace continues for decades with the arms race (explaining the modernized gears), proxy war, cultural and ethnical exchange within their own alliances (explaining the race customization), the military draft going further to women because of the lack of manpower nations wasted in WW2. (explaining the gender customization)\n\nIn 1960, more than two decades later from the beginning of WW2, Germany successfully creates the atom bomb. This comes as a shock that could shake the entire state of affairs for the Allied that turns the cold war to the hot war. At the absolute height of conflict similar to the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Axis forces nuke London, Washington, Moscow and start to launch massive invasions on the Allied, igniting World War 3. Battlefield V takes place in this war of the fictional timeline."
8wvm2i,Slasher crossover fighting game by NetherRealm,"So, as you know, NR is a fan of using slasher killers as guests in Mortal Kombat (Leatherface, Jason, Freddy). So,meh at if they made a game similar to Injustice, but with Slashers? It would be a big crossover with killers from all over the horror genre. They already have the rights to tons of slashers, so I think it's a possibility."
8wvg57,A dinosaur fighting game with collectible character figures,"I had an idea for a game inspired partly by the fighting system in Jurassic Park Builder and Jurassic World The Game. Basically, it's a turn-based fighting game with classes that have strength over one-another. Carnivore is strong against Herbivore, Herbivore is strong against Aquatic, Aquatic is strong against Flying, Flying is strong against Carnivore. Kind of like Pokémon. You collect dinosaurs and you can name them, upgrade them, customize their appearance, change their moveset, change their stats, etc. Here's where the unique part comes in - the dinosaurs are collected through buying collectible toys. Imagine them like Amiibo; you can name and customize each individual toy to be your own. Then, you can go into battle and summon your toys that you spent time customizing. I think that when bought in stores, the game would come with four creatures, one of each type. A Deinonychus, a Pachycephalosaurus, a Dunkleosteus, and a Pteranodon. What do you think? How can the concept be improved upon?"
8wuymj,Modern Survival Game Idea...,"So this sort of just came to mind when seeing a screenshot of a different game, not sure which one, but I thought I'd like to share this idea because you guys might find it interesting too and maybe add on to it! Modern day style, nothing super futuristic. You start off in the woods, just outside a small compound, with only a pistol with 2 clips, clothing, and a small backpack, the objective is to find food, water, medication, shelter, and survive the night from wildlife (and possibly people.. no zombies or aliens though, I've never been a fan of zombies hehe.) You can find guns like sniper rifles, automatic rifles, uzis, SMG's, pistols, grenades, all that jazz. There would be towns and possibly small cities you can find that loot in. Once find enough basic survival materials, you can find building materials and begin building your own shelters like a house or underground/aboveground base. I was thinking a Stranded Deep type of building mechanism. You can build things from small wood shacks to... beautiful mansions? I'm describing a mix of Unturned, Minecraft, and any Hunting game now that I think of it lol. It would also have the ""Realistic"" look to it. It might be a shitty idea so don't bully me if you think it's ass, just downvote hard so I lose all my precious karma. Thanks for reading, if you would like me to go into more detail I can but I highly doubt it because I suck at explaining things."
8wr9ll,"A co-op roguelike spaceship sim about colonizing and exploring a shared, procedurally generated galaxy.","First, envision a co-op FTL crossed with No Man's Sky.\n\n**Mankind had just started exploring other solar systems when it received faint signals from the furthest edge of the galaxy. It triggers a new space race. Adventurers rush to perhaps be the first make contact with intelligent alien life.**\n\nYou start off in one of the game's home planets. You join up with 2-3 other random players to maintain and pilot a junk ship. You'll ride it as far as it'll take you with the little fuel and supplies you have. You and the rest of the crew take on different roles and responsibilities to keep the ship functional as you journey from beacon to beacon, planet to planet.\n\nAlong the way you run into pirates &amp; hostile forces, travel through asteroid fields and nebular storms, refuel at space stations at various stages of disrepair, and gather supplies on uninhabitable planets with treacherous environments. At many points, your crew will also have the options to render aid to other ships (both NPC and players in distress), space stations or fledgling colonies. Doing so could cost you your life, that of your fellow crew members, or the ship itself. But if you succeed, the next people to run through this area will have an easier time.\n\n**See, the unique hook is that the galaxy is persistent and shared among all players.**\n\nIt's sort of like No Man's Sky in this regard, except everyone spreads out from the same cluster of home planets so unexplored planets are rare. It's only the edges of where players have reached that remain unexplored. As players make travel safer further and further out, more players will be able to travel further.\n\nThis is not an MMO however. Even if hundreds of players are on Planet SG55-NK at once, for example, you'll only interact with one other crew (for trade, rescue, hostile combat) if the game wanted you to.\n\n****\n\nLastly: If you die, you're sent back to the start. Alone. You'll be paired up with new companions who also just joined the lobby, to see how far you'll get with them. If you want to quit early, you can retire at any peaceful port. You can pick the game back up at the same spot with a new crew that hired, saved or discovered you in the middle of their run. Sometimes after you die, you'll start having been ""discovered"" in an airlock or escape pod by another crew in the middle of their run in the area you died."
8wqjq9,An RPG where you can do anything but not all in a single game.,The problem: \n\nGames that advertise having a lot of choices tend to overwhelm me because I want to accomplish everything but don’t always know the best route nor do I want to spend the time required to plan it all out. \n\n\nThe solution:\n\nAt the beginning of the game you pick your class and tell the game what you enjoy doing (with certain limitations based on class). Based on your input it creates a linear story that allows you to level all your skills in a way that progresses the story. Maybe there’s a few quests available to be done in any order but only within certain Acts and you’d be required to complete them to move on.
8wpkvb,Everything in one full social HUB,"Alright hear me out I know its ambitious and might be impossible right now but:\n\nImagine a full lobby with like 1000 Players per Server and everyone has a unique style and appearence.\n\nTake for example the ""Oasis"" from Ready Player One. Now you think alright, and now? Imagine different portals that lead\n\ninto games, for example a FPS with your character in it, or a RTS or just a fighting game. So you have all these games into one, and the best is, its free2play. \n\nHow would you finance it? Ofcourse with cosmetics! Yeah at the start of the game you can create your character and have a big variety of clothes and hairstyles and one and one to choose from but with every patch comes new clothes and pets and its basically a big social hub. Also players can create new clothes and can offer them on a big ingame marketplace!\n\nAnd you can buy apartments for real money, or you could have special pets that only drop out of lootboxes yatta yatta yatta. But the point is you can get everything for ingame currency, it just takes long to farm, but it's fun because you get the currency from any game you wanna play. \n\nThank you for reading my thoughts."
8wpctm,You play as a huge robot in space that goes out and puts deodorant on planets,"Planets call you up and asked to be sprayed with certain types of deodorant for the upcoming Planetary Ball, which takes place at the centre of the Andromeda Galaxy. The ball is in three weeks so you have to get around quickly. \n\nThe puzzles would come from: having to make the right mixture of deodorant; putting on the right amount; finding fuel and fixing your thrusters; and navigating  space-related obstacles, like giant umbrellas; big, blue pelicans; and asteroid fields. "
8wp2m9,Sea of Thieves but in the Jungle?,"I've been obsessed with the concept of adventure and finding old treasures. I'm just getting into Sea of Thieves and while I know many don't like it, it really fulfills the criteria of going out and striking it rich in a really vast and beautiful environment. \n\nWhat I'm thinking though is something a little bit more on the realisitic side. I'm thinking Darkest Dungeon sanity with Sea of Thieves adventure. Almost like Indiana Jones but fucking punishing. \n\nThe time frame should be around early 1900s late 1800s perhaps. Maybe later into the 30s. It could take place in multiple biomes but you have a central meeting place to meet up with comrades and you can pick up books that would start quests for you. These would give vague clues aswell as a destination. From there, you can choose to stalk up on supplies before you embark on your adventure but you will have to budget if you want to make a profit. However don't worry because you can (over the course of time through experience of running through the same environments) craft equipment out in the wild however the caviat is that it is not as strong as say something you could buy in the store that is, ""professionally made"". \n\nGameplay should vary from biome to biome and they should also come with their own unique challenges. Since this is also a survival game, I think hunger and thirst as well as sleep are an important part to this experience. These effects if drained, not only give debuffs but reduce things like movement speed, awareness (if there is combat this means that you are weaker and don't have as much strength unless you're fully taken care of). Nights are DARK and the only HUD you will have is a hunger meter, sleep meeter, thirst meter and health bar. You will have to rely on a compass and map (which you can mark) to make your way through your environments and to find your treasure. Torches burn out and nights get cold. Dryness if youre in a desert environment will degrade your thirst faster for example. This game is supposed to be punishing but the more experience you gain as an adventure the better the payout and difficulty scales. Think of any difficulty mode but the one especially in DOOM with Nightmare and Ultra Nightmare compared to Ultra Violence or anything lower. The higher difficulty you go, the more your finds get you. We're talking from a hundreds to thousands to even tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars depending on the quest you embark on. \n\nThe reward system would be cosmetic aswell as equipment based. You could spend your money on important equipment but you won't be able to get it right away. Say something like a grappling hook would be available in the store right away but you would have to save money to get it. These would have to be priced fairly because you also need to spend money on equipment and while items should feel like a partial grind, it shouldn't be feel like a ridiculous experience to constantly go out and do quests for hours and hours on end just to get an item that is highly recommended you get. \n\nGoing back to environments, I think jungle, forest, desert and cave environments are a must and can be the core for other minor alterations in the world.  I think the map should be like a WoW map where you have to take an airship go to a different continent but the map is open world. \n\nMultiplayer would be lobby based however the central meeting place could have dozens in it at a time and you could recruit people from their to assist you. The way Sea of Thieves operates is that you can play any questions with anyone but you need to be of a specific level to unlike certain quests and I think this should be similar. Anyone can play with anybody but if you play a higher level quest with a, ""level 1"" random, that person will run into troubles because quests will scale across ever player but will scale slightly up to the highest player if that makes sense. \n\nAnyways I'm at my train stop now so if you guys can flesh out these ideas, feel free to do so! I bet a lot of you guys have better ideas."

8wluw9,Game where you hire heroes to join your guild,"I know this sound really unoriginal from the title, and that is because this is just a shell of an actual game idea. Please tell me if there are any games similar to this that are already published.\n\nSTORY\n\nThe character is an adventurer from a small town stricken with poverty. The guild that currently controls the town is not doing its job of running the town, and the character wants to change that by creating their own guild. The character's goal is to travel that world and hire heroes to join their guild. Each hero the character wants to hire has a quest or task that must be completed in order to recruit said hero.\n\nSETTING\n\nThe game takes place in an old fantasy time where guilds and mercenaries run the world, instead of a traditional government. The largest guild in each town or city acts as the ruling government of the town. Some large cities have multiple guilds that either share or fight for power.\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nThe combat is turn based and each hero has 4 moves corresponding to buttons A, B, X, and Y. Heroes level up through combat and max out at level 50. The characters guild gains ""influence"" by hiring and maxing out heroes. The character also finds materials that they can take to an artisan in order to craft gear. Each hero in the party (max party size of 4) can hold 3 pieces of gear at a time. Gear alters the hero's stats or moves."
8wkzj3,Far Out Mon!,"A 2d top down Survival Game. Take the survival aspects of Far Cry 3 such as hunting and crafting weapons but this time instead of hunting wild animals to get material, you hunt Pokemon.\n\nYou are abandoned on a Jamaican Island where you only have your pokedex to assist you. Your pokedex has info on the pokemon of the island. Since pokemon have mysterious abilities you must use the pokedex to devise strategies on how to capture/kill them. Special weapons/clothing/equipment may be needed to capture some of them because of their special abilities. Other pokemon may be unknown to the pokedex so you must study them for yourself and add notes about them on the pokedex, such as their powers, special abilities, weapons that work on them  and if they are edible. The material you get from them can be used to make new special clothing/weapons. Maybe eating a MewTwo can give you its powers temporarily.\n\nSome Pokemon can be tamed to help you defeat other enemies. \n\nNow nintendo would be pissed if they saw their pokemon in another man's game without their permission so you can use parodies of them or create your own original beasts. \n\nSo in a nutshell (Far Cry + Pokemon) in Jamaica\n\n\n\n"
8wgma6,"A game like Evolve, but with a shrinking play area much like Fortnite or PUBG","one of Evolves major problems was how matches would quickly devolve into a boring chase scene with the hunters just mindlessly chasing and losing the monster. The shrinking play area would make it so the matches don't turn into boring chase sessions, and eventually the two sides would have to face each other.\n\nsome other changes to the gameplay id like to make\n\n&gt;the monster is in 1st person\n\n&gt;arena should not be a dark dank boring jungle. it should have urban areas mixed in\n\n&gt;the hunter team and monster should have a MOBA style levelling system to upgrade themselves by slaying NPC mobs when not fighting each other.\n\n&gt;NPC mobs should be smaller varied beasts for the hunters to kill, and Human soldiers in the urban areas for the monster\n\nwhat do you think? I think evolve was a really cool idea that just didn't work in practice.\n"
8wgbb9,Heavily scripter game where you play as a less important character,"I started to remember Valve's Blue Shift and all that and realized that there are not many if none such games anymore in which you play as a lesser important character.\n\nBut they could and should take the idea even further. You play as a common Citizen. Waking up realizing the world has gone to shit. You Will struggle. You will be afraid. You have no idea what is happening, how you will survive and what will be in the next room.\n\nThen at times you run into these organized army troops or something similar and as a bystander you watch them trying to work out the situation. You might hear glues about what is going on and such.\n\nThe sense of security you feel when you are close to them should be made as well as possible.\n\nThis could be more of a mix of interactive movie and a game. \n\nWhen you are left alone you really should feel you are just a commoner and you there is only so much you can do or know what to do. These moments could be slow advancing buzzle solving and making sure you don't run out into anything horrible."
8wbpi2,A farming game except it's a mad rush. Crops grow within seconds and each day is just one minute long.,"What Half-Minute Hero did to RPGs, this game would do to the farm-life genre. It's like a simplified farming game on fast-forward.\n\nTo keep things simple, you only have about a 20x20 plot of land and the town/shops/NPCs are conveniently right next to it. Every crop takes multiple unique steps from sow to sell and they'll spoil on the vine (or the seeds will be eaten by crows) if you take too long in any step.\n\nEvery system in this game is designed to keep the player frantic until the end of the 60-second day.\n\nAfter the day is over, the player gets a splash screen and all the time he needs to rest and maybe plan for the next day. Upgrade farm, upgrade tools, level up skills, buy seeds, buy livestock, check on relationship meters, check the weather forecast, plan for tomorrow's objectives, etc. This pause in gameplay would exist for pacing only. After all, the player needs rest between the bursts of anxiety.\n\nBut as soon as he gets out of that screen, it's another mad dash 60-second farm day."
8w5ng9,How about NON game app ideas?,Q: I'm new and I would like to ask you if can I post ideas for every kind of app I can imagine other than only games. I have many game ideas but I would like to know if you acxept and ideas for other kinds of applications or programms...
8w4va9,A realistic-ish RPG where you play as a stray dog,"Upon joking with my dog about how I'm going to die and he'll have to go on without me I thought, damn that would make a good game!?\n\nThat's the setting, you as a dog faithful to your master go along merrily...but your master tragically dies, how will you survive?\n\nThe choices are vast!\n\nWill you embrace the life of an urban stray, figuring out how to find food in trash? Will you figure out how to steal from people or will you go down the charisma route and use them ol' puppy dog eyes to secure your meals? Beware of the scary dog catchers...\n\nAs this game would be told from the dogs perspective they would be your enemies in the city, as well as any hostile animals.\n\nAlternatively will you go an entirely different route and venture out in to the wild, unleashing(and unlocking) your primal instincts, learning to hunt, building up your senses, finding and joining a pack, becoming top dog etc etc. Complete with predators of course.\n\nPotential for Rogue-like/New Game Plus elements, you have puppies, grow old and die then take over as one of the pups to play in a new generation with new challenges, layouts etc etc\n\nThe only side of it I can't think of is if you do get captured, because it wouldn't necessarily be game over. In real life you'd have a decent chance of being adopted...and then what? It'd be hard to make living with a human character be fun, doing the same routine every day.\n\nA fun part of it could be getting quests from other dogs and then also getting quests from humans...but they speak a language you don't quite understand, only certain words and you have to figure out what they want.\n\nAnyway yeah I think there'd be potential for a really unique and hopefully fun survival game there, so long as it was realistic and not a ""You have to eat every 5 minutes or you starve"" babysitting game.\n\nI realize that's a ton of smaller ideas grouped together but I think done right they could create an amazing game if it managed to be quite serious but still retain some light heartedness. Something goofy like Goat Simulator wouldn't work with these ideas for instance.\n\nTo my mind something with the production value/budget of a game like say Elex would be ideal, obviously you couldn't expect a full on AAA game with every single dog hair animated from such a concept, that'd be quite a risk. Otherwise I think it's a pretty adaptable concept, I'd prefer it to be single player perhaps with co-op rather than an MMO. Playing co-op with your pack would be pretty cool but seeing hundreds of other people running around as dogs would take away from any realism in it, I would imagine it as a not quite hardcore game but you know, an \*actual\* survival game.\n\nThoughts?"
8w0lee,Storyline for an adventure game.,"I've come up with this storyline for an adventure game I'm wishing to make.\nGive a critical judgement on the story, and I think I really need it.\n\nThe story is about a boy willy who's parents never get along.

8vvib8,4v4 moba idea I had,"Im not personally a game dev, but i do concerting in spare time. A game i always wanted to see was a game where 2 people are designated the recourse jungle, where they can farm iron and diamond(rarer) and upon kills they get gold and the player loses the items they had stored( gets discarded not dropped).  the other two are in the city trying to farm victory points, the resources go to victory point trackers and combat stats for the two players in the city. Killing people in the city doesn't drop their points, but tells the other team exactly where they will respawn. To drop off resources and victory points, you have to return to base (no tp scrolls, must walk all the way back). Through this you can balance champions with abilities for both the jungle and the city. i think it would be cool since i have always liked 2v2 competitive games and allows for creative dev space.

8vt9zj,A Cold War mmo.80’s patriotic adventure (G.I.Joe + World of Warcraft),You would be a blue solider that would have to fight on American and Russian war destroyed city’s in order to stop the reds from taking over the world. It would be over the top and not take its self seriously with a war B-movie feel to it.\n\nYou would be a blues solider sent out to stop the reds dictator and save the world and the blue nations.The quest would see you go though ruined mocks of famous city’s like Las Vegas and New York to get to a military Air Force base where you get to a ruined Russia and get to the dictators bunker. \n\nThe setting would be a 80’s destroyed American and Russian city’s and other famous landmarks.\nThe areas would be colorful and big with hidden secrets and Easter eggs all around them. There would be military influence all around the city as the streets and other buildings look ruined and abandoned.\n\nI was thinking about giving it a 3rd person shooter vibe where you would buy and loot lots of different weapons that can do different effects to enemies. Combat would be fast passed and fell like a bullet hell with you having to doge enemy fire as you fight.\n\nIt was just some random idea I though up\nAny thoughts?\n\n

8vqtfi,Tomb Raider (2013) as actual survival action game,"One of the cutscenes from Tomb Raider (2013) was Lara getting impaled, which, at first, was seemingly a hugely important plot point, hamfisting the theme ""this game is about SURVIVAL Y'all"". A half hour later, it gets completely forgotten after the opening by making Lara Croft female Rambo. It has no bearing effect afterward in both gameplay and story. But a few hours later, the game suddenly pulls that plot point again and shows the cauterization scene without a proper context building for it, almost as if the game's saying ""oh, yeah, this was the 'survival' game."" And the game's back to normal pew pew shooter again.\n\nIt is not the worst thing in the game, but this plot point showcases the reboot series' missed potential. Adding the grounded aspects of survival to Tomb Raider reboot is a great idea to separate other modern adventure games like Uncharted and early Tomb Raider games, but the game only pretends to be a survival game while pandering to the same modern AAA gaming crowds.\n\nI'm not proposing Tomb Raider should have gone Minecraft or DayZ, but having actual survival systems similar to the ones from Metal Gear Solid 3 would have helped immensely. Here are my three ideas:\n\n- Stamina meter\n\nIn earlier Tomb Raider games, platforming was a challenge. It was something the player had to master, and also added some realism to it. While this was due to the developers' lack of knowledge on how to do the third person platforming for 90s 3D games, it is unfortunate all the challenge is gone in newer Tomb Raider games, which is ironic since the reboot aims to make Lara Croft a realistic character while also making her invincible who can do impossible moves in climbing and combat.\n\nMy alternative on imposing the difficulty in platforming is not adding a complicated set of control, but a stamina meter similar to Breath of the Wild and Shadows of the Colossus.\n\nHow much stamina Lara has affects the health regeneration speed, the movement speed, climbing and aiming. Her grip meter is limited to the current stamina which will run out faster if the player's stamina is low when climbing. \n\nHow much a stamina the player has is different per difficulty level, but it should take about 20-40 seconds to empty the wheel depending on how the player acts. If the player takes time and climbs things patiently, the stamina decreases less. It decreases faster if the player moves faster, actively climbing left right and constantly jumping for the upper platform for the speed.\n\n- Fully fledged Hunting\n\nLara gets to hunt a deer and it is treated as an important plot point to highlight how this game is different from other shooters... Once. In the story event.\n\nAs I talked about the stamina, to refill the meter, Lara needs to become Bear Grylls and hunt and eat. Lara can found many preys to eat and charge her stamina. Preys don't have to be deer. Lara can eat anything: birds, rabbits, bugs, rats, honey.\n\n- Surgery\n\nJust like ""Show, don't tell"" is how the visual storytelling works, ""Play, don't show"" is how the interactive storytelling works. Aforementioned 'surgery' cutscene only cheapens the theme as the game just regenerates your health automatically. There is no medkit like The Last of Us or Far Cry 3 heal animations to complement the theme of survival.\n\nSo you get shot and brutally injured from the enemy (for example a close-quarter shotgun blast), and while your health still regenerates, your maximum health decreased. Similar to Souls games, the health max health limit is shrunken, worst at capped at 25% of your original max health. To revert back to the default maximum health, Lara needs to reach the Base Camps and treat herself, using the supplies player found on numerous levels.\n\nObviously, there should be a drastic balancing for this to work like the enemy rarely having an automatic rifle or a huge change in enemy accuracy and health. But it could make the game that truly differentiates from other modern and the general audience still can enjoy."
8vnvj0,Platforming game ideas,"Since I’m a student in summer I’ve been left with a lot of free time. What better to do with this than to sink it into a project, this project being a game. I’ve made games in the past using Unity so this isn’t my first attempt. I’ve decided to make a platformer because of their simplicity and it’s my favourite genre though I’m having trouble with an idea of a game. Like mentioned before the game will have to be pretty simple since it will likely be only me developing it, the best idea so far is to have the game revolve round a single gimmick. So my question is what makes a platformer good? and what features would you like to be seen in a platformer?"
8vjazg,What is a game idea likely to be made ?,"Hi everyone, I'm a developper searching game ideas to create on my spare time, so I wander through this subreddit to find something that will tilt.\n\nThe problem is, I can only work on the game in the afternoon after work and I want it to take me less than 1 month of developpement.\n\nSo I have some criteria when I search an idea :\n\n* The game is based around 1 or 2 inputs. What I mean by that is that the game have to use only one or to keys or button to be played\n* The game play duration is around 5 minutes. It sound really short, and it is, but the more the game lengh is, the more time it take to be made, and it's exponential.\n* It's centered around one mechanic. It's better to do well one things than doing badly to many things.\n\nIt is a bit harsh, but if you can check theses boxes, you'll probably have more chances to have your game ideas mades.\n\nBut aside of this, you're great, thanks for sharing your ideas :)"
8vhriu,"Open world, episodic counter terrorism game.","Open world counter terrorism game.\n\nThe protagonist is part of a small government intelligence unit tasked with identifying and stopping potential and confirmed terrorist plots in an urban city environment. The city could be fictional but based on a number of European cities, this would allow the game to be sensitive to recent incidents around Europe and the world.\n\nThe game world would be open, however the missions would play episodically in a similar way to LA Noire.\n\nMissions/Scenario's could include:\n\nTracking a missing terrorist suspect before he carries out his attack, you would have a very short period of in game time to complete this, as he would be rumbled and is therefore committed to carrying his attack out sooner.\n\nLocating missing military/police weaponry.\n\nStopping a van/truck attack.\n\nDealing with a mass hostage situation after becoming first on scene.\n\n\nGame play wise, the protagonist is backed up by his small unit, consisting of: IT/Comms ""voice in the ear"" person, providing updates and situational reports. Drone pilot, allows a drone to be launched in the vicinity of the players location. A pair of back up ""heavies"", two person back up squad that can provide sniper overwatch, AI teammates for building clearances etc.\n\nFor gunplay, the player will predominantly use pistols, long guns can be used in a similar way to Max Payne, so only two weapons can be carried at once.\n\nIf you'd like me to flesh this idea out more let me know!"

8ve34x,3D horror game idea based off of Mario,"I thought of a possible 3D horror game based on Mario that could be made for the PC, maybe also for VR if anyone here knows how to make those. Basically, the game sets you in a haunted house almost identical to the ones found in Mario, where you have to try to find your way out. Additionally, you would have to deal with ghosts trying to come after you, which look like the boos found in Mario. Of course, just like in the Mario games, when you look at them they’ll freeze up. However, since the player would be playing in first person, you wouldn’t be able to tell if they are behind you unlike in the traditional 2D Mario games. If someone does end up creating this game, (although I don’t expect this to get much attention, since this is my first time on the subreddit), I expect loud jumpscares of death, scary looking boos, and a really eerie/unsettling house of puzzles and traps. I think the game would be creepy because the ghosts would have a weeping angel/scp 173 vibe to them. IF someone does find this game idea interesting and wants to know more details about it (I doubt it though) you can contact me on discord, my tag is firepit3#2903. Thanks for reading!"
8vdaih,International Chemical Company Strategy Game,"The game is maybe 30% complete, but hopefully I can still post here.\n\nI've been working on this game in my free time for a while now, but never really considered if people would enjoy it.

8v9s7n,Desert island survival,"I had an idea for a desert island survival game where it would be single player or maybe 4 player co-op max. The aim of the game is to escape the island but to do so the player has to gather resources on the island to build a raft strong enough to escape the island. The game would have a hunger, thirst, temperature and energy bars where they have to collect food, water, keep cool/warm and sleep. Maybe even a sanity bar where the player has to occasionally entertain themselves to keep them happy and sane. Crafting and building would be limited to things such as using branches and stones to build. Maybe occasionally a random item can wash up on shore that could help them or sabotage them. There could be weather effects where randomly storms and hurricanes that could happen and potentially destroy the players camps."
8v8xu2,Little Skills,"The idea is a mobile game that, essentially, teaches the user some 'little' skills, useful in life (or as a little gig at a party).

(If you're looking for a way to earn money as dev for this idea, ads during meditation train the meditator to ignore distractions.)\n* Learn Morse Code.\n* Keep a to-do list of memories (as a computer stack-ish), and be able to recall (the last few of) them. Items can be added and removed at the end, and the whole list (or the last few) can be recalled in order.\n* Train your internal compass and be able to use the sun as a compass.\n* Know basic survival tips (including seafairing ones).\n* Learn First Aid.\n* Pavlov yourself such that you can teach your body tricks (i.e., see in the dark--Pavlov: lights out when I clap four times, clapping four times gives almost-instant pupil enlargement).\n* Learn to spot inconsistencies and notice which item has been taken away from an image.\n* Learn simple mathematical and chemical 'life hacks'.\n\nThese ideas came from thinking what I'd like from transhumanism (the cyborg movement, [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transhumanism)) and how it could be implemented without gadgets (thus a form of biohacking).\n\nThe skills can be taught differently, some game-like, some as documents with images, and others as how-to for real life (such as the Pavlov one).\n\n*X-Post* r/AppIdeas"
8v4l8x,RPG's dialogue : [Truth]/(Lie),"""Demendor was a great man. He collected many enemies through the years, but it was a necessity. If he were still here today, he would be impressed by your action""\n\n""- He truly seems like a great man, I wish I had met him [Truth](Lie)\n\n- He was an evil man that never listened to others, I'm glad he isn't there anymore [Truth](Lie)\n\n- ...""\n\nIt seems like a weird mechanic at first, but I find it disheartening to choose ""the right answer to progress a quest/reward"" when it goes against the morality of my character. \n\nSaying that you don't care about Harnishia's dead husband will close you the quest, she doesn't want to talk to you anyway. So you have to be empathetic. But you're evil and an asshole. So you simply have to lie to her. \n\nLying would be tied to charisma/speech skills, so if you check them against someone with a high perception/observation skill, you're deemed a liar, and you lose your speech check. \n\nWhy would you use the ""Lie"" option instead of the ""Truth"", then, if you don't care about RP? \n\nWell, some options would be (Lie) only, things you haven't done, things you don't know - and the more you lie, the better you are at it. \n\nSo it's balancing act, Lying makes you better at it and might gives you good reward in the long play, but being caught lying diminishes your reputation, your *fama*, your fame. \n\nIt would bring back an interesting meta-game for conversation I think. \n"
8uvv4b,I'm making my first videogame...SniperTown!,"I'm making a video game. It's going to be a Battle Royale game (duh), but you can only be a sniper.\n\nI'm calling it ***SniperTown***.\n\nInstead of dropping from the sky, everybody starts on the ground and for the first 3 minutes you can't see any of your opponents. You have to find a place to hide before the timer ends because when the match starts, everyone is visible and the game begins.\n\nEach match will be 300 players on a 100 square miles of randomized terrain. The map will contain all climates, from valleys of rain forests to ice-covered mountains. There will be a weather system, and just for fun I am going to make it so 99&amp;#37; of the time the weather will match the climate, but sometimes you'll get a tornado on a mountain peak, or a snowy blizzard in the desert. This will be the only thing about this game that is not realistic.\n\nThere will also be a full day/night cycle, in real-time. You'll have better visibility during the day, but you have a better chance of moving undetected at night. Different wildlife (see below) appear at night, some of which may be hostile. You can always hope that some of your opponents set up shop outside a lion's den! You may ask why they would do that. The answer is that the game always starts during the day, and animal dens (there are a variety of them) are hidden by a cloaking device until night-time. Surprise!\n\nIn SniperTown, matches don't have time limits, and the map doesn't shrink over time. It's possible that a match can last for hours, even days. The match ends only when all players have either been killed or perished from starvation and/or dehydration. I would \*love\* to work with Brita or maybe Poland Springs to develop a specialized cup that, via USB or Bluetooth, would register the amount of water a player drinks IRL, and add a percentage of that to their in-game avatar. This way SniperTown can promote healthy behavior outside of the game. That's down the road, though.\n\nPrior to starting a match, you can alter your loadout. You'll have limited amount of storage, so you'll have to decide what's more important: bullets or food/water. And all items cost in-game money that you earn by doing well in previous games, or earned in side-quests like capturing various wildlife/bugs for scientific purposes. For example, you may notice a moth that hasn't been previously discovered. If you (carefully! without giving away your position!) capture the moth, after the match you can visit the Research Center and trade the moth for in-game funds. But - and this is important - the Research Center only pays for living specimens, so making room in your inventory for at least one Specimen Container is probably wise.\n\nYou can also eat the wildlife/bugs for substance. And since there will be weather, it may rain, and you can gather water. So it's possible to just bring bullets, and hope for lots of wildlife and rain to give you food/water.\n\nI have more ideas, but wanted to put this out there to see what people thought. I'm going to be using Unity, with some custom plug-ins I'll be creating for the weather and wildlife."
8urdh6,Block chain based Community MMO,"The title says most of it and i am really open to more interpretation.\n\nBasically my idea was an MMO where after creating basic structures and when it comes to a point where game devs start to binge creating content, it becomes decentralized.\n\nMeaning the game creators will let the block chain ""miners"", given that they have game design skill, create content of their own and sell it in game. Examples: landscapes/cities, pets, monsters, items. The items will could or could not circulate the game. Also it has tags of who created it and how many of it in the world to confirm rarity and avoid plagiarism.\n\nBasically the game will be a community MMO, no pressure of making money and also content to 1 game dev team. If the art style is on shambles then maybe it is part of the game.\n\nImagine creating landscapes and citites and selling parts of your land.\n\nAnd items that grow stronger and rarer depending on how many enemies it defeated, or whoever famous character held it."
8zbz60,Two ideas: probably garbage,"A free-for-all shooter with cat zombies and you each have 8 lives. With every death you lose a limb until you're just a head with a gun rolling around. The last life of being a head would have the fastest move speed but be awkward at aiming and have the slowest reload time; So there are good advantages and logical drawbacks(of course cus cat zombambos) come death.\n\nAnother one would be a game about something really simple like a kid taking up a job mowing peoples grass. At first just straight forward you got a job to cut Mr Wrexly's yard to learn mechanics and such. Then the story turns and the yards are inhabited with evil gnomes or monsters etc. Your character is kind of a One Punch Man character in that no knows what your doing and you get very little to no credit.\n\nThe best scene I could think of would be your character is just beaten to shit, bloody and near death, knocking on an old woman's door. Her answering and saying ""Well took you long enough m8, maybe this line of work isn't cut out for you. Such a simple task and you look like you've been to hades and back. Now I don't get paid till' next week but I think this should hold you over till then."" And she hands you a jar of pennies, closes the door on you, and your face twitching into and fake smile and you comically fall over from exhaustion.\n\nNow the jar, as with most rewards, seem useless at first but are ,in fact, great tools in fighting whatever you'll be fighting. I would think maybe a Dark souls progression system and fighting mechanics with a light Windwaker-esque enviroment, where a cheery delightful scenery could turn to an evil abode for a demon creature and it be believable.\n\nThat's it only got two. Prob garbo but figured was the right place for it. "

When the seeker finds a hider the seeker is then able to catch and eat the hider. \n\nTheir will be two main maps in the game including a oasis with some ancient temples or a Tokyo city with a strip mall.\nAll of these maps will be interactive and in order to reach the best hiding spots you will have to solve mini puzzles. \n\nIn order for the hiders to hide they just have to run into an object and press the interact key and they will start hiding. Alternatively they could just crouch under a table/bed using the crouch key\n\nThere is no way to harm the seeker so in order for the game to end you must survive for 10-20 minutes throughout that time the seekers vision will be slowly degrading and at the end the seeker will shutdown.

8z1jt3,A Mad Max-Style Arcade Racer,"So I've been watching a lot of Wreckfest recently and that got me thinking: that game might work pretty well in a post-apocalyptic setting. So that's how I got that idea.\n\nLike in the 2015 Mad Max game, the main feature would be a fully customizable car. But since my idea would be a racer and not an RPG, the gameplay would be way different.\n\nBasically, players first choose a body for their car. They can then choose to complete PVE quests like destroying convoys or completing time trials or join PVP races. Completing quests rewards the player with scrap, which can be used to upgrade their car or buy extra ammunition.\n\nYou can complete a maximum of five quests at a time before having to join a race, where the player will be paired against other players who have won the same amount of races in a row. These races would work like the ones in wreckfest, with the obvious difference of the cars being post-apocalyptic war machines. The amount of scrap you win is determined by your final position and the amount of quests you competed before starting the race. Aka: the fewer quests you completed before the race, the more scrap you win, adding a risk-reward factor for more skilled players. \n\nBut here's the catch: If your car gets destroyed in a race or during a quest, it's gone for good. You will lose all your scrap and your car will be gone, you'll have to start from scratch again. That would mean that the game would almost play like a roguelike, where death means you lose all your progress.\n\nYou win a run by winning five races without dying in between. Winning a run rewards you with a special currency that you can use to unlock modifiers. These modifiers can then be activated at will before starting a run, adding more risk/reward to them. They could be something like ""you take double damage, but earn double scrap"" or ""ammo is 50% cheaper, but weapons cost double"". These would add more challenge for more skilled players, but not give them/the other players a (dis)advantage. \n\nLet me know what you think of my idea. It just came to my mind today and I'd like to know what others think of it. Thanks :) \n\n"
8yznfb,Willy Wonka-style factory simulator,"You could do things like use rivers to transport chocolate, splice cows with genes from cocoa beans (or maybe just feed them cocoa beans) to make chocolate milk, and other crazy stuff like that. Maybe include temperature management, so you have to keep the areas with chocolate rivers warm, but you might have to keep other areas cool to make ice cream."
8yz2gf,A deconstruction of the fantasy strategy genre (eg. Fire Emblem),"You play as a prince who must flee his kingdom after a general stages a coup and makes the kingdom a republic. At the start, the game is a traditional fantasy game: recruit allies, retake your throne, etc.\n\nHowever, as the game progresses, the game gets morally grey. As it turns out, the new king has made a number of changes which give more power to the citizens. Ordinary people now can learn to use magic, which was previously reserved for the nobility. The people now also have representatives in the government. These changes horrify the prince, who see the commoners as unworthy of these privileges.\n\nMany of the party members are former nobles who are angry that the republic has redistributed their money and land to the commoners. As the prince tries to take it back for the monarchy, however, it becomes clear that the changes were for the benefit of the public. The money has helped lift people out of poverty, and the land has become a home for people who used to be homeless. After a while, even the nobles start to believe that their loss might have been for the best. The prince vehemently disagrees and wants to fight back against the public. Over time, the new leader starts to seem more benevolent, while the protagonist starts to seem more elitist.\n\nThe game culminates with the hero attempting to kill the country's leader, at which point the entire party decides to stop him by force. The prince then becomes the final boss, and he retains all the equipment and stats that he had before. In the end, the prince is defeated, and the former rebels make peace with the government. The party members are accepted back into the kingdom, and they go on to see their leader peacefully transfer power to the next one. The goal is to shine a light on the real-life problems that have risen from monarchies, problems that fantasy games often ignore in order to romanticize the past.\n\n"
8yxnbd,A MMORPG where the main gameplay mechanic is crafting/enchanting/making your own things.,"Of course I know that it would be extremely hard to code and make this game a reality, but it’s been a dream of mine for a long time and just wanted to share. \n\nBasically you would start off by choosing a race (ex. Undead, Humans, Elves, Dwarves, Buddha, etc.) which would have certain passive boosts or debuffs accordingly. \n\nThen, you would start off with nothing but starter clothes and you’d have to fight monsters with your bare hands (starter mobs ofc). Monsters would only drop raw materials (maybe have a dismantling mechanic). \n\nThen you could go to a village or some place like that with a forge and use the raw materials to create your own armor and weapons by using some sort of limited 3D modeling (for example metal would become malleable when heated but teeth and bones would have to be carved or just used as is.).\n\nLeveling, classes, and skills would also be a thing, however I feel like the idea I had in mind for those is incredibly hard if not impossible with today’s technology. (Unique class modeled after the specific player, self-made skills, and progressive leveling) (I know, merely a dream)\n\nI just feel that if we had the technology able to do this (along with immersive fights) MMORPGs would truly be dominating any other video game genre."
8ywzly,Enemy idea. Need help.,I wanted to make a game where the enemy’s are  like mind controlled and savage but here in suits like the trauma harness in old world blues or the ghost people in dead money. Any suggestions?
8yvi5c,A game where you play two fighting siblings and try to cause as much chaos as possible,"Basically, imagine a game where you control a cartoon style dust cloud fight with two siblings in it and you cause chaos and make a huge mess by ramming into stuff. But it would be game over if a parent catches them fighting. So there would be a button to stop fighting, but you can't move while holding it. I'm imagining the game having a top down view with a cartoony art style.\n\nSome features I thought of but haven't decided if I should keep:\nA bit of customization where you could select 2 characters and they'd be the ones you control.\n\nThe ability to make the fight bigger by picking up other kids.\n\nEndless mode. Props would be repaired after a while and more adults come as time goes on.\n\nSo that's my idea. Do you like it?"
8ysbgd,A Godzilla game where you can destroy everything.,"The game takes place in present day where Godzilla has emerged to destroy humanity. You can play as Godzilla destroying everything, or the UN trying to exterminate it. You will be taken to places such as. Tokyo, Hong Kong, Sidney, Anchorage, Los Angeles, Miami, New York City, Rio De Janerio, Cape Town and Southampton. All ending in a final battle at a small village on the coast of Greenland. Depending on the side you chose, Godzilla or the UN will win. That’s the story of the game. If you’re playing as Godzilla it will be third person, but if you’re playing as the UN it’s first person. And the best part, you can enter every building in the game.\n\nThe multiplayer consists of three modes the 1st mode,is Godzilla Survival. Where you’ll play in the story mode maps with 28 other people playing as the UN. And 1 person is playing as Godzilla. 30 people in total. The second mode is 15vs15 the UN fighting each other. With unlockable variations of Godzilla, and full outfit customization for the UN along with your load out. And the third mode, Godzilla showdown where you play against 1 other person as another Godzilla on the single player maps. With full destruction in everyone’s hands, in multiplayer and the single player story.\n\nSo that’s my idea for a Godzilla game where you can destroy everything no matter which side you’re on.\n"
8ypoen,Game about escaping with roguelike elements,"The game would be about player and other NPCs trying to escape a procedurally generated location ( for example space ship, mansion ) with creature/killer in it. It would be turnbased.  Here's the vital part, the NPCs would have the same class as player, meaning they could do everything what players can do through scripted behaviours. Basically bots. Entities would move on tiles, the perspective would be 2D top down view just like in roguelikes. This concept is really bare bone, I see it as some kind of slasher movie simulator, there would be a tool for players to create their own settings, items, killers/creatures. There would be some ready presets of course. As I said the entities would move on tiles, the game would be in ASCII with support for graphical tiles, so the players could easily modify tile sets. I don't know if the game would be 3D or 2D, but lighting would probably play a huge role. Look at the Brogue's lighting and gas effects, it really would add to the atmosphere. The game would simulate whole place, which wouldn't be that demanding since it would be some NPCs pathfinding around, basic lighting and some fog and gasses like acidic clouds and some 3D rendering, if the game was 3D. About some gameplay now, everyone would start right next to "" escape room "". The goal is to escape the location. In order to unlock the escape room, players and NPCs have to find a key or pull a switch, which is somewhere in the location. Creature or killer would start patrolling the whole location. It would follow smell if it can, it would check out the source of various sounds like footsteps or shouting. NPCs and players would have to avoid killers. After player's death, game calculates player's score and adds it to the high scores, then the player would enter spectate mode. Player could watch the slaughter in real-time, quit or take control of some NPC. If the player did take control of some NPC, then his death wouldn't be added to the high scores. After the game's over, players could compare their character's stats with other NPCs' stats. And that's it I suppose.\nAbout the map now. Locations would be procedurally generated. \n1. Game checks which setting i.e preset is chosen.\n2. Game randomly picks an escape room and spawns it.\n3. Game spawns rooms like key/switch room, killer room, special rooms, spawn room and regular rooms.\n4. Game links them with hallways, then checks, if every room can be entered from the spawn room, if not, the game tries to link the rooms again.\n5. Game spawns items or decorative stuff like corpses on the ground.\n6. The game asks the player if he likes the map, if not, then the game repeats step one.\n7. The game begins.\nThanks for reading, let me know what You think about it."
8ypfxo,Maze Game,I made a program in unity that generates multi story mazes procedurally. I have no idea what kind of game to make with this so I would like some input. 
8yp923,A game that develops a deep emotional connection between the player and another character before asking the player to kill him/her.,"It's possible to avoid killing the character, but its harder to progress if you do. There'd be other things to do for fun like exploring, etc. before progressing, so the big challenge is whether you could emotionally handle killing the person."
8yordz,Best Car Game Ever,"Firstly, if this game does exist, please let me know. So yesterday i was thinking of buying a car game and this idea came to mind. Imagine Car Mechanic Simulator, a game so detailed when it comes to cars, down to the last screw. Now imagine a game where you start off with a $1,000 dollar car, and you are on a lonely road, drag racing for money. (this game would require a good car but importantly skill) you would have to do perfect shifts in order to win the race. you can bet money and race other players. Now lets say you cant beat this one person, so you go into your garage and order a turbo online, then you get the item and now what.  Most car games will automatically apply the upgrade and off you go (like GTA V), but in this game, here you have to install it yourself, (like previously mentioned, just like Car mechanic Simulator). After that you can go out and start racing and betting, now you have enough money to buy a better car, this can support more upgrades! BUT, this isnt a pay to win situation, better cars are harder to shift, so it requires more skill, You can have the best car in the game with the best upgrades, and all the money you can have, but if you cant shift into the next gear then you end up losing. so its pretty balanced. More features that will make this a better game is online, (preferably open world), so you can race others and bet your money, (maybe even bet some car parts or cars themselves). It would be the best car game ever, some players may prefer to build sleeper cars, others just but fancy sports cars to show off, some can just build their dream car and show their friends online. The perfect game doesn't exist, but if game developers can make a game like this, i would buy it. Maybe Car Mechanic Simulator,  Wreckfest, and other game developers and get together and make this game a real thing! This game could compete against The Crew 2, Need For Speed, and others that don't come to mind at the moment. If this game does exist, please, please, please let me know. Thanks for reading!"
8yoapi,battle royale ideas real life,[removed]
8yn1ub,A battle/party game in which each player can only eliminate other players by squishing them.,"This is a little tricky to visualize, so imagine *A Link to the Past* with 2-8 Links in one room and they can only attack with the Running Boots. The catch is that simply hitting someone won't kill them, you'll have to squish them against a wall or other player.\n\nExcept the characters are squishy slimes holding bulldozer plates in front of them, and players can move in any direction. The dash/ram attack animation has some start-up time, you have *some* directional control while ramming, and there's some lag at the end of the attack if you hit a wall (like Link's dash attack).\n\nThe regular battle arena is just a plain room, but the are arenas with static objects or walls in the middle, or even some maze-like ones with tight corridors that almost look like a Pac-Man maze."
8yige6,Merging two popular core mechanics in space. Turn-based ground combat (think XCOM) and ship/crew based RTS (Faster Than Light),I feel like there should be a space-faring game that has the mechanics of turn-based combat like XCOM and also has real-time strategy space battles where crew and various functions of the ship have to be managed like Faster Than Light. Roguelike elements can engage player's crew in ground or space combat while flying around points of interest to reach an objective. Developing crew members and ships through something like a skill tree can add a ton of diversity to the game. 
8yfj4s,Tutorial Game,"The game is the tutorial , select a difficulty and try to survive through the levels till the end . "
8ybr90,A survival game mechanic where you transform into anthropomorphic versions of animals you eat.,"I had this idea whilst I was cooking. Out of the blue I wanted to avenge this chicken so I thought maybe I can eat it and absorb its powers. \nMaybe in the game when you eat a shark, you can now breath underwater and pursue deep sea exploration.\nMaybe when you eat a bull, you become as strong as one and grow some pointy horns.\n\nI actually had a different idea since I'm not a fan of survival games. A chicken's spirit asks for your help in avenging his comrades. Basically a beat em up game where you first buy food in a certain store and then avenge the animals by destroying meat factories which abused them. You have a fixed amount of cash for each level and you must choose wisely which meat you want. Eat the meat and gain the animal's powers (let's assume all animals are edible/tasty)\n\nThe effects can be permanent or time based. It's up to you really. So not only will food give you health but it can also give you powers. If you want to eat but don't want to waste the powers, you can eat fruits or vegetables."
8y7zi9,"A co-op game where one player assumes the role of ""mission control""","I had this idea while playing Payday, which, for those who don't know, is a 4-player co-op game where each level is a different career-criminal heist, ranging from bank robbery, to abducting a meth lab's money-filled panic room, to interrupting an IRS deal to share data with a corporation in order to share the data with another client. Throughout each mission, the players are guided by an unseen individual named Bain, who scans police radio for incoming attack information, manages assisting characters (getaway drivers, helicopter pilots, etc), and generally keeps the player characters informed.\n\nIn this idea, one player takes Bain's role in the mission. They're provided with things like a police radio, manuals for tools, camera feed tablets, etc, and utilize those items to guide the players through missions that never go quite the same way twice, somewhat in the vein of Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes, albeit with more variety than just a single manual. "
8y7ynw,What’s a idea for a venture brothers like game? (Point and click explore-a-thon),I wanted to make a game with funny characters and extensive lore like in the show. I was thinking about doing spooky story’s but I want something more adventurous and explorative. 
8y7twr,open world adventure action MMO idea. mix of future science city and paranormal ancient ruins,"The story is that there is a tomb of treasure and you are hired to try and open a huge tomb of treasure for a large company. you must find 3 artifacts that are keys so that you can defeat the god of greed and take all money for the company.\n\ncombat would be turn-based with you having to fight off many enemies but can use healing medicine when low on heath. you would be able to find ""stud-E books"" will give you a permeant perk. For example, if i have a  Hoplology book my weapons would do more damage, or if i have a Epidemiology book my heath would increase by 50.\n\nFor setting I was thinking about a futuristic Las Vegas mixed with Hollywood  filled with robots and hoverrails but with many ancient cursed ruins and tombs filled with ghosts, skeletons and many other evil being studied. There would be many business, laboratories in the deep city and many ancient ruins and factories in the outer part of the city. Each place would have its own backstory and lore connecting it the the world."
8y627s,Basic game concept.,"Just putting forward a very rough idea for a new type of battle royale/survival game. There would be a lot more players (1000?) And the map would be massive. There would be no storm so the games would go on for days maybe. Players would be dropped into a map and have to scavenge for rescources and craft houses and guns (kinda like ark). The bad players would be picked off early on and when it got to the top 100, people would have these massive bases that other players would have to attack. You would be able to form alliances with people. You could craft a radio device, that lets you open a voice chat with another player no matter their location. I know people arent going to sut their for too long, so you would be able to log out. When you are logged out, noeone could kill you. Like in a normal battle royale, it would be last player standing.\n\nI am aware how much straon this type of game would put on servers, so you would need lots. This is my first game idea, so this game probably isnt possible, i was just putting forward an idea."
8y4s1i,VS Tower Defence,Basically a tower defence where you have a defence phase and attack phase. The path to your base starts at your opponent's base which is opposite your own. \n\nI think the only way to make the game balanced would be to have you earn cash based on how far your troops make it rather than killing the enemy. Some levels could have more than one enemy so you get to chose your path. 2 Player would also be an option. 
8y4ivk,"Alternative solution to ""The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild""'s shrines","Despite having a massive change of series' tradition, Breath of the Wild still follows the Zelda convention of having dungeons that are separated and non-interactive from the overworld, in this case 'shrines' which I think most people agree that it's the weakest part about the game.\n\nAlthough the game still has gigantic dungeons through the guardians, Nintendo resorted into the shrine system which acts as ""mini-dungeons"" that spices the elements of Zelda dungeons into multiple smaller puzzles and fights to complement the openworld. As a result, the shrines feel barebone. Even when they have an interesting puzzle concept, due to their minimal nature, they never explore it further.\n\nCritics suggest on making the shrines more complex and proper like the traditional Zelda dungeons, but I’m not sure I agree with this. Instead, how about abolish the border divides the dungeon and the overworld?\n\nFor example: as you wander, you hear from some adventurers that there’s a settlement entirely built and ran by a bunch of orphans in the forest near the mountain like Little Lamplight from Fallout 3. They say no one, not even a monster dares to go there because the forest is full of deadly traps set by the children. \n\nSo basically the forest works like a mini-dungeon and you have to solve the various puzzles and avoid the traps to go to the child settlement. It’s not divided by the loading screen, it’s completely seamless with the overworld.\n\nOr how about making dungeon-like paths to reach a mountain or a valley? Once completed, it creates a new route or area you can take as a shortcut in the overworld. Or you can even find a goddess statue that grants your wish of heart container or a stamina increase.\n\nBasically, certain parts of the overworld are designed like the dungeons similar to how The Witness and The Talos Principle did. I know that BOTW does have some elements of this, but I feel like it didn’t expand enough to take full advantage and potential of this amazing openworld Nintendo has created."
8y4a1u,The Accountant - A document-discrepancy game about chasing paper trails to help businesses and catch embezzlers.,"You're like the Sherlock Holmes of finance. Companies, governments and individuals hire you to sift through their documents and find discrepancies to solve their problems.\n\nMechanically speaking, the gameplay would be like *Papers, Please* in that you are given piles of documents, except the cases are each unique, huge mysteries and without time constraints. You follow discrepancies like clues. Some of the inconsistencies turn out to be simple clerical errors, while others will lead you to request more documentation and records and potentially huge crimes.\n\nThroughout different cases, you'll save struggling businesses, prove the innocence or guilt of individuals in criminal trials, uncover infidelities of politicians, and even bring down massive corporations and criminal empires."
8y1fst,Rhytm game mechanics!,"Hi! I'd like to ask people here if they have any rhytm ideas? I mean mechanics, like in Crypt of the Necrodancer the player is supposed to time his steps and attack, to corelate with rhytm. Or as in Osu! the whole game is based on clicking circles.\n\nIt doesn't matter if you have idea for a **top-down, side view or full 3D rhytm game**, I like them all!"
8y0o1g,Identity (Cosmic Bounty 'spin-off'),"One of the mechanics in my dream game 'Cosmic Bounty' is where the player must register their ship and identification when travelling to other planets for missions. Player's would be able to form a sort of friendship with many of the checkpoint inspectors. \n\nIdentity, puts the player in the role as one of the checkpoint inspectors! \n(NOTE: You'll be able to choose what planet you are situated at) as a checkpoint inspector, the player must review everyone's paperwork against a list increasingly complex rules using a number of tools and guides. \nOnly allowing in those with the right paperwork and rejecting those without all proper forms. Player's will have the ability to integrate and if needed detain those who are on a wanted list or who are hostile.\n\nDepending on the planet the player has chosen, the news will display the outcome of the player's decisions allowing the 'story' to progress (an example being of they let a terrorist through and said terrorist blows up a building).\n\nAside from managing a checkpoint, player's will also be responsible for managing their apartment (food, water, electricity bills etc). Depending on the player's decisions, the player could inadvertently cause more issues for themselves as more rules and pay cuts would be put in place. \n\nAs you could tell, this game concept is heavily inspired by 'Papers, Please'. Keep in mind this is extremely early in development and I haven't thought of more ideas to give my own spin on it yet... Thoughts and suggestions? "
8xw79y,[VR Game] Great Speeches of History,"Posted this to Twitter and thought it would make for a good r/StartupIdeas post. Then found this subreddit... Crosspost!\n\nThere's this idea for a VR ""game"" that I've been playing with for a long time and I think it has some legs. It's called ""Great Speeches of History"".\n\nI'm never gonna find the time to do it, but if [**facebook**](https://twitter.com/facebook) Oculus, [**htc**](https://twitter.com/htc) Vive or [**playstation**](https://twitter.com/PlayStation) VR could talk to their developers...\n\nHere's the idea: you are one of the great speech givers of history. You are standing in their shoes. You see the crowd around you and understand the historical context. I think this would work really well in VR. Then, just like a karaoke app, you recite the speech, aloud. The app keeps track of how well you do, the emotional tone in your voice, etc. The crowd would respond to how good you are doing.\n\nThis would be great for people interested in history, for educational purposes, for people who are afraid of public speaking, for people who want to train this skill. It's the guitar hero I would actually play.\n\nIt would also potentially lend itself very well to user generated content. And it would be relatively cheap to produce compared to other games, because the size of each scene is limited.\n\nCesar when he crosses the Rubicon\n\nMartin Luther King, ""I have a dream""\n\nTheodore Roosevelt, “Duties of American Citizenship”\n\nWinston Churchill, “We Shall Fight on the Beaches”\n\nLou Gehrig, “Farewell to Baseball Address”\n\nDemosthenes, “The Third Philippic”\n\nChief Joseph, “Surrender”\n\nThere's soooo many. Cesar or King would probably make for a great demo.\n\nCan someone please build this? I promise I will buy at least 2 copies."
8xut5f,[Request] Top-down game mechanics / story,"I started developing all those systems that work really well together a while ago. I set up the grid, character movement, animations, a conversation system... I never though I would reach the point where I would finish all these, but here I am, with a finished base to start building a game and without a plan.  \n    \nThe game is top-down, the movement is based on a grid, like old pokemon games. The graphics are the ones from [finalbossblues](https://finalbossblues.itch.io/). ^(check out his Patreon, really worth it if you like the style)\n  \nRight now I'm planning my next steps but I have no idea about what to do with all this. I was thinking that maybe a story to start with would be good, something to do with magic. Also I'm open to implement some core mechanics to make the game fun like puzzles.   \n  \nAt this point I'm open to everything so all suggestions are good!\n\n\n"
86sm8t,A new kind of RTS,"So I was thinking about an idea of a game- not specific, but a general idea that could be expanded upon.\nThe main idea is that it's an RTS with changing objectives. When you start the game, you 'own' half the map, and the opponent owns the other (scales depending on amount of players). You are given a list of changing objectives that will make it easier to complete the main objective- destroying the opponent. As objectives are completed, your area pushes closer to the opponent, eventually being right outside their base. While units are inside your own area, they are stronger, but weaker when near the opponent's.\nFor example:\nOne player will have the objective to capture a tower, which will defend their own area. The other player, however, will have the objective to scout the factory. If the scouter sees that the other player is capturing it, they will automatically be given the objective to destroy it. This will cause both players to begin in combat. However, multiple objectives will be present at once, and the player can of course not do the objectives (but will make it a lot harder for themself).\nAny ideas?"
86rgkn,[Request] Hex-Based Game Need Some Help!,"So I've been developing a hex-based multiplayer game like civ, except its sort of like a rts rather then turn based but I need help developing a attack mechanic, any ideas?"
86q6hq,game idea,ok so what if there was a game where its like a rpg such as skyrim but instead of traditional leveling system that you go from 1 to 100 or whatever it is 100% based on real life skills such as if you know about chemistry you can do alchemy by combining the regents  and if you have good reaction speed melee combat is good if not shields and things are viable instead of using something like a 2 hand to block a but like for honor but it could also have a magic system where it has basically a language used to make spells and scrolls are aplicable for players who dont want to memorise required words for more complex spells leaving way for the ability to be really overpowered in one aspect of the game and is much more gear based and real life skills where those types of things determine your ability to survive and thrive in the game so even if you suck you can still make it through an economical win by mastering the ability to supply the gear and potions and scroll to other players making it a much more real world like thing and leaving the ability for one person to act as a god of sorts that is the best in their respective field meaning that with enough want and effort you can aquire real like skills through this game and have the ability to go as far as you want or are capable of in any aspect of this game with a really player driven world where you could even be just a leader of an army for your skills in tactics meaning everyone is viable in some way either a general a skills merchant or maybe even cannon fodder under the generals command
86pygd,"[Survival Game] You are a bum that is given the opportunity to learn from a godly mentor how to hack. You can scrape by, die, or climb your way to the top of society with your new skills.","The focus would be on realism instead of glorified hacking like in movies and current games. You brute force weak passwords and encryption methods to snoop around and steal worthwhile information. You disguise clever viruses on the internet to create bot-nets to do your bidding. If you don't properly hide your traces with techniques like ""packing"" your executables, you might find yourself under investigation by the law. Everything would be generated at the start of the game such as identity, bank account balance, where an npc lives, what they own, etc. so there is always a new approach to how to survive. Only the ""teaching"" events with your mentor are not randomized; they are specific hand holding missions to learn real world hacking. \n\nThe game doesn't have difficulty settings, but the equivalent of hard mode would be to just pan handle and not hack your way to the top.\n"
86py7g,a game idea. (it involves purgatory),"this game is like the theme of binding of isaac met the gameplay of don't starve. you are a man who has died and gone to purgatory. you start at a waiting room like place. and you have a one real time our for processing to see if you go to hell or heaven. you have to survive in purgatory with evil monsters and items. the thing is that you have a good and evil meter.  when you get certain items or kill enemies you get a more evil, witch increases your damage while if you get other items or friend enemies you get good and it increases your health. If the meter is closer to evil when the hour passes you get the bad ending where you go to hell and when the meter uis closer to good you get the good ending. that basically it. If you have any ideas for it tell me please. "
86ppur,[AAA] Rebellion vs Government Style Game,"So this game is a generic FPS when it comes to controls, but it would be story based. There also might be games out there already like this but none that I know of.\n\nAnyway, the game would be 13 chapters long, and 2 prologue sections. The prologue would start with you as the Presidents security guard, and it's at the height of a public out cry, and riots are happening. The President has finally came up with an idea that will help everyone. He tells you that you two will leave for the meeting in a bit, then you do the tutorial which is you as a the security guard at a shooting range. You then drive him to the meeting area. You get out, open his door, and show him to the stage. He walks up on stage and you are following behind him, when he is shot in the head. The it cuts, to 30 minutes earlier, you are now in the rebellion talking about why everyone is rebelling and that the rebellion doesn't believe the president cares about the people. It ends with you being the sniper that shoots him. That's the prologue. After that, 12 years later, every chapter you switch between the security guard and the rebel. You hear both points of views, and you see the problems both have. And neither group is completely right or wrong but at the end, after chapter 12, you have to choose who you play as which means you have to choose a side and kill the other guy.

86nkwd,Blockade: A two-player tile/board game in which players take turns trying to block the other (mockup inside).,"[Here's a sample image.](https://i.imgur.com/jApvrTk.png)\n\nHonestly, I wouldn't bother giving idea games a name but this one was just too perfect.\n\nThe idea is a tile board game for two players who each take turns replacing one of tiles on the board with one from their hand. The catch is that you can only place tiles along a *route* made by your tiles on the board, starting from your ""home row"" at the bottom.\n\nSo in the example above, you can choose to put the ""1"" tile in your hand, move it over the ""4"" title at the center of your home row, up 4 spaces to the ""1-2"" tile, then diagonal left to replace the ""3"" on the opponent's home row. At which point your turn is over.\n\nAfter each turn, each player must prove they have a *route* from their home row to their opponent's home row. The game ends when one player no longer has a route to the other side.\n"
86ne80,Tribal setting open world game to some extent inspired by Dark Souls.,"Well you know how you sometimes start thinking about random stuff. So I thought up this video game idea, I have no way of making it so I decided to post it here as that's what ""here"" is for.\n\nI know jackshit about game design so I'll write mostly lore and conzepts here.\n\nThe game would be generally centered around the number 10, 'cause I like that number it's not too much, but no too few.\n\nAt the beginning of the game in a cutscene or something you see 10 hooded women who all together carry a green flame-like light to what seems to be a cementary full of undead each of the ladies represents a different thing:\n1. White - spiritual and light magic\n2. Black - necromancy and black magic\n3. Red/Orange - fire magic\n4. Brown - earth magic\n5. Blue - water magic\n6. Gray/Blue- air magic\n7. Metalic Gray - teachnology and smithing\n8. Green - nature, poaching, alchemy etc.\n9. Golden - comerce and trade\n10. Blood Red - martial arts and weapons\n\nYou choose one of those and it will give you a small boost in a ""stat"" and unlock some additional dialogue option with that NPC. \n\nThe chosen NPC then would proceed to take the green flame to an alter overseeing a cementary overrun by zombies. Then the player gets to observe the zombies. They would posess verious equipment and know already some basic spells which the player would see. She/he then choose which zombie he wants to inhabit. That's when designing looks etc comes into play. The player then has to leave the cementary and reach the hooded women. Things will only start attacking the player once he leaves the cementary and he/she needs to beat a miniboss. If the player fails and dies (which will probably happen the first few times) he/she get's to choose another ""zombie"" to inhabit. This will let the player check out various skill options and combat options in the tuturial when getting to know the game in the tutorial. Obiously the cosmetic character creation changes should auto-save and carry over from original character creation.\n\nReaching the 10 NPC's and talking to them would mark the end of the tutorial. The 10 NPC's would serve as crafters, trainers and traders.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe fighting system in the game would be based of ""martial arts"" basically speaking you can have your character save a certain amount of ""moves"" in a weapon at first 3-4, but later much higher numbers including combos. The moves have amounts of damage they do which scales according to stats and also have stat requirements to use. Weapons on the other hand would function as modifiers to those ""moves"" I'll try to make an example:\nExample stats: str, dex, con\nExample weapons: Dagger, Sword\nExample move: stab\n""stab"" requires: 10str, 14dex; dexterity scaling\n""stab"" damage: 20 piercing, 0 slashing, 0 blugeoning\nDagger propperties: str requiremnet 1/2; dex requirement 5/4\nDagger scaling: Piercing = good; slashing = medium; bludgeoning=bad + medium dex scaling bonus\nSword properties: str requirement 1, dex requirment 4/5\nSword scaling: piercing=mediocre; slashing=mediocre; bludgeoning=bad + small dex and str bonuses\n\nScaling would be counted in ""x"" times requirement. Requirement would not make it impossible to use a weapon rather it indicates ""average output"" so bellow ""x"" you get a negative modifer and above a possitive one so using a weapon with bad scaling would make sense even if you don't have the ""requirements"" met. As such we also see that a dagger would be a weapon very supperior to use in a pure piercing+dex based attack.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMagic would be somewhat simmilar the player would only have acces to elemental magic so no black and white magic. All magic requires ""slots"", but unlike other games attuning a ""spell"" is permanent and can't be removed, but spells can be upgraded and modified. The player would have maybe 6 slots which could be used up at various times. Using a spell slot would be represented by a tatto (max 2 on each hand + 1 on each leg). Getting addtional spells would be possible with specialised gear.\n\nAn important rule I have for the game is ""no ranged attack for anyone"" As such spells are only buff, utility and crowd controll. \nExample buffs:\nFire - does fire damage; adds to ""penetrativity""\nAir - lowers str requirement; incresed piercing damage\nWater - lower dex requirement; incresed slashing damage\nEarth - deffenssive boost; incresed bludgeoning damage\n\nPenetrativity refferences two things. Basically the higher the ""penetrativity"" the more does an attack ignore armor. But also each attack is meant to damage one creature doing much less to each next it hits high str and penetrativity midgate that loss in damage.\n\nUtility could help you jump higher run faster etc maybe minor telekinesis etc.\nCrowd controll would let you modfy the ground to slow down enemies break down ""formations"" etc.\n\nBasically the spells in the game work like ""cantrips"" in games like D&amp;D you can use them as much as you want because they are small permanent utility things which help you.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nSome lore then. There are 10 cities each has sent a maiden to ""create"" the last possible thing to end the curse of the Ancient Homunculus. Each of the 10 NPC's you meet at the start is one of them and represents the culture of her city. The cities are walled and gated and noone can enter them; one of the cities has been destroyed.\n\nThe world is right now overrun with zombies. The Ancient Homunculus was a weird creature. Thousands of years ago people started creating Homunculus (synthetic humans) to wage war; they were like golems you needed to feed or zombies which could think to some extent for themselves.\n\nThe thing is that in the setting once you kill something you absorb part of it's soul, essence and power. For humans the effect is minor because they have a powerful soul already filling them so it absorbs and assimilates any soul fragment it gets. Humunculus on the other hand were empty without soul so each soul fragment survived on it's own within them accumulating. The ancient humunculus has been fighting for millenia accumulating so many souls and power that he became Godlike. The kingdom the fought for had become decadent because every war could be won just by using him. The thing is that by ammasing so many sould the Ancient Humunculus has gained sentience and his artifical body became to weak to hold his immense power. He started dying slowly crumbling. In one night he destroyed his home kingdom and went on a rampage seemingly seeking out strong opponents to fight and annihilate while destroying entire kingdoms just because they were in his way.\n\nThe Ancient Humunculus defeated 9 chapions and lost to the 10th one. The thing is that that was his plan, in each of those 10 strong oponents he left a seed which contained his very essence. So when is dies instantly all 10 are possesed by that essence the dead ones come back to life. They became of sorts Demon Lords dividing and ruling parts of the land having the undead and life there under their controll.\nI'll list my ideas for them in the order in which the Ancient Humunculus fought them: (names random titles only mean stuff)\n1. Clara the Wingless - an unusually big female wingless dragon. Dragons in the setting a long huge serpentine feathered creatures which fly in the sky. They are omnivores, Clara though being wingless since birth became very agressive and carnivorous reaching the ripe age of an acient dragon. She is an immnesly ferocious animals which uses the dozens of blades and swords in her back to attack her oponents.\n2. Bow the Godslayer - an ancient archer who was once known as the most powerful living things. He killed so many with his bow that the accumulated soul shards transformed him into a beast which wielded a 100 bows in 300 hands. His bow became so strong that he could his any target from any place in the world and he showed that by killing one of the gods with his bow even piercing the obundry between the realm of God an men. That's why there are 9 Gods and one of the cities was destroyed. The Gods then decided to seal all of ranged combat making it impossible. ""Bow"" was still a fearsome fighter as he modified his bows to not shoot out the arrow making his fighting style very weird.\n3. The Golem - a massive golem created out of solid Jadeit wielding an Obsidian blade and a Bedrock shield. It's the greatest achievement of human science and the result of all 10 kingdoms to finance and build it. It was supposed to be the last hope of humanity, but failed.\n4. Ainsley the Hero - a hero chosen by the Gods and granted immense power to battle the Ancient Humunculus gifted with immense talent and an unbreakable blade created by the Gods himself he was meant to overpower and destroy the Humunculus. Sadly even though he outmatched the Humunculus vastly in raw power his lack of experience splilled his doom.\n5. Michael the Archangel - a powerful angelic being and a servant to everything holy in the world. Normally Angels would never intervene in anything which goes on in the world instead only observing and serving the Gods. But the Ancient Humunuculus was an abomination to the word so the champion of the angels decided to take him on and failed.\n6. Dakka of the Masks - Dakka was an ""ancient"" a creature related to angels, gods and demons and the first to inahbit the world. They were once worshiped as Gods and so is he now. He is an unusually strong ""ancient"" and most ancient would serve as minibosses instead.\n7. Lothric the Scribe - unlike many before or after him Lothric was not a warrior nor did he seek to fight a humunculs he was a librarian and researcher of magic. Living in a massive library full of monks he was leading. Inspite of that he was granted a worthy foe by the ancient humunculus and truly by using his most potent forms of magic he managed to nearly win when the Homunculus turned to attacking his students and it was then when the scribe carerassly betrayed by his kindness died.\n8. Ug the Soldier of a thousand Wars - a seemingly once normal man he fought in many wayrs and gained unimaginable skill and wit managing to beat every oponent in his path with a mixture of tricks deception and raw skill. In the end though the raw power of a Human was not enough to destroy the Ancient Humunculus which created a prolonged battle in which the Human died of exhaustion.\n9. Naka the fisrt among the Undead - an immensely beast created from thousands of undead supposedly having a Demon straight from hell at it's core. It was created by necromancers as a last resot to save themselves, but in the end not only did they get killed by that abomination, but it didn't even manage to stand up to the Ancient Humunculus.\n10. Yan the Undefeated - a gerel from a bygone era dying of old gae. Known for his genious and for never loosing a battle. Asked to defeat the Ancient Humunculd he could only answer with ""It's impossible"" then forced back into duty he was give the finest warriors humanity had and each of the was implanted with a magic stone letting him controll them perfectly even after death... Only once Yan discarded human tactics and used his soldiers like tools manipulating him into tactical manouvers barelly possible in theory was he able to defeat the Humunculus.\n\nOkay now for some lore thingies. \nThe setting is pre the ussage of metal. The main materials for making weapons is stone, but more expanssive weapons are made out of jade, obsidian, bedrock, quarz and iron-wood.\nJade - bonus to scaling\nObsidian - bonus to slashing\nBedrock - bonus to bludgeoning\nQuars - bonus to piercing\nIron word - incresed power of spells on it.\n\nAll of them would also have special properties like Obsidian being very brittle which would be midgated by red strings embedded into it basically every few times you hit something with an obsidian weapon you need a few seconds for it to repair itself. Same with all types of material.\n\nWhat I also want to do is have the setting not have a classical writing system instead to make a conlang which is used for naming all the things and a lot of easter eggs are hidden in text in that language in-game. And all of the language is written down in strings and knots based on an ancient Incan semi-writing system. These hanged writings would also look great as decorations on librarian-type characters.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGameplay:\nThe player character in the game would be considered an abomination by the NPC's. He could not enter any of the cities (also because they are unneded for plot) and most even non-evil humans would be hostile serving as mini-bosses. The Player is an unnatural disgusting union of celestial/white spirit magic and necromacy a ""Synthetic Spirit"" a soul created by human hand.\n\nThe player would start out in a neutral are and is supposed to take out the 10 bosses in any desired order while exploring the world. Once he enters the territory of the bosses the creatures change theme. Clara for example would have a lot of dragons there and Bow would have the ""cult of archers"" emulating and serving him. Meanwhile Yan would have normal undead just using more skilled ""tactics"".\n\nYou see I thought it would be fun to program in ""formations"" for the enemies to use. Basically once nemeies spawn based n their number and type if they fits they would enter military formations making them work together and the player would first need to break them up to fight them properly.\n\nThe next thing is also that the world progresses with you. When you kill a boss is fragment of the Ancient Homunculs is redistributed to the other bosses making them stronger. Which would work like this:\n1-3 bosses - natural state\n4-6 bosses - feral state\n7-9 bosses - posessed state\n10th - resurected ancient humunculus\n\nBasically if you fight you first boss he appears as what he originally was let's take Clara the Wingless. If you fight her as the first boss she would appear as a somewhat overpowered dragon who can't fly but has swords in her back. If you fight her as the second or 3rd boss she would be just a bit stronger. If you fight her as a 4th or 6th boss she gains an additional moveset where she pulls out a sword from her back and fights with it in her hand. When you giht her as a 7th or 9th boss you would see her limbs become longer and her body more humanlike she would laso grow shadowy wings slightly altering the moveset further. If you decided to leave clara as last you'd be suprised to find that she is dead and out of her body has emerged the ressurected Ancient Humunculus which only needs to defeat you as you hold his remaining soul fragments.\n\nThe enviroment would change the same way. Let's use Dakka here as example. Dakka controlls both undead and his former living undead servants. In his normal state his Masked Warriors are way stronger than the undead and the Undead mostly support them in combat both are on equal ground. In their feral state the undead become hostile to the Masked Warriors which now have supporting role and keep away from the undead while fighting. In the possed state the undead have slaughtered the Masked Warriors and now they use their base pines with a masked head at the end as weapons and magic staffs.\n\nThe game would also have 2 semiuniversal currencies. Once you kill an enemy you loot them and then you get a choice:\n1. Consume Heart\n2. Extract Soul Shard\n3. Prepare Vessel\n\nConsuming the heart increses your XP, it directly increses your streangth and level. Extracting a Soul Shard gives you a soul shard which is used as a currency in magical procedures.\nAnd preparing a vessel is making a save point. Essentially any defeated humanoid enemy can be changed into a 1-use bonefire if you run out of ""vessels"" it's perma-death. This would insetivise people to create at least some vessels and probably way more vessels than they actually need.\n\nSoul Shards would be used to for example incres your ""Void Inventory"" basically the player has a very small ""Void Inventory"" and a Normal Inventory. Items from the Normal inventory are lost uppon death and return into the world. Items from the Void Invetory are bound to your soul and always with you, you'd also have a storage space the 10 NPC's place.\n\nWhen teleporting you can take your normal inventory along even thouch ""telemporting"" is technically speaking just switching to a vessel you prepared somewhere so changing bodies. Your looks stay the same as the soul decides the looks. A prepared vessel looks like a human body without any features.\n\nThe other currency is Gold or Gems or something for buying normal earthly goods.\n\nI also have some more things in mind, but those are mostly details for emmerssion. If anyone likes the Idea I can elaborate. Sorry if it's messy I'm really bad at writing stuff like that.\n\nP.S I'd like the enemies to have somewhat randomise placements each time the lore reason is that your respawns are not insteand they actually take a lot ingame time and the more powerful you become the more ingame time it takes. Detail like ""vessels"" getting covered in spiderwebs would be cool to add then."

86khu1,City builder/simulation in space,"How about a builder/simulation game that takes place in a Star System rather than on a single plot of land (like most city builders). \n\nAllow me to explain the idea in more detail, using comparisons/contrasts to a game like Sim City.\\n\nSim City is a builder game and a simulation. This would be both of those things as well.\n\nThe economy would be based on the trade between your planets in the star system; assume free trade between them. Consider in city builders the player zones land; in this game, you'd control the economic output of a planet: agricultural, industrial, etc.\n\nTo make things more interesting, at the planet level, you could allow a planet to decide its economy on its own, therefore letting the planet influence its own wealth based on the trade needs of the star system. For example, a high demand for food in a star system would make it likely that the planet would increase its agricultural output. Choosing a command economy would put the player in charge of everything, however.\n\nOverall goal:\nMaintain a healthy, happy populace, strong economy, etc. Same as sim city. The hook for the player would be the maintenance/progression aspect of the game, and also the ability to continue building, and nice visuals.\n\nVisuals:\nRather than watching little cars drive down the streets, we'd see ships moving between planets. Trade ships carrying goods would be large. Human transports might be smaller. The ability to look at a planet in detail and see a high level overview of cities, its continents, etc, would be useful.\n\nThis could be an massively multiplayer game that exists online and runs through a web browser using WebGL. Each player could start with a single planet, and then inhabit an entire star system later. Trade could exist between star systems, and combat could be added."

86eufd,Nightmare because of Christmas,"Keep this in mind, if there was a large bank robbery in a city with hostages and all sorts of bad stuff, that would take a lot of police attention for the whole city to deal with.  So while all cops are busy on one side of town, one criminal can commit a crime on the other side of town and probably get away with it.\n\nSo.... with that in mind, think of a game where you are a worker under the devil, the first Christmas is fast approaching in about 3 days, and you have to do all your prep work for the big day.  Once Jesus is born on one side of town, all the angels are busy with that, you can do your devilish deeds on the other side of town.\n\nThe task set before you is too big for you to do in one night.  After Christmas is over, all the Angels leave the Christmas scene and come and deal with you.  As the player of the game, you die.\n\nRound 2, time starts over and now it is 3 days before the first Christmas again and you need to redo the previous round, but advancing your goal further, this cycle can repeat itself until you finally complete the ultimate nightmare because of Christmas.

864g4m,"The player has all the abilities from the start but their mechanics are obfuscated, so ""unlocking"" them is actually just learning them. The second playthrough becomes wildly different.","A game that would normally have gated off progress behind unlocking abilities (e.g. metroidvanias or Zelda type action-adventures) can be modified so that the hero character has all the abilities from the start but the player hasn't learned how to use them.\n\nInstead of the character gaining an ability, the *player* is finally taught to use an ability he had all along.\n\nThis way, instead of the standard, ""*oh, I guess I'll have to get an upgrade later to get past this obstacle,*"" becomes an, ""*oh crap, I could have done this in those places I passed.*"" It also makes it so that a second playthrough will have the player sequence breaking at every junction, which can be taken advantage of by the developer to sneak in an expanded story for the second playthrough.\n\nIt wouldn't be easy to implement, however. Such a system would require obfuscating vital player mechanics so the player can't guess or stumble upon how to use them properly. Abilities would have to be made *unintuitive*, which generally goes against standard design principles. But if done right, I believe it can be uniquely rewarding.\n\nI've heard Toki Tori does something like this, but I haven't played the games.\n\n##EXAMPLE GAME\nSince retaining memories through playthroughs becomes a theme in gameplay, it would fit the story very well.\n\nPicture a top-down stealth-action game in the style of *Metal Gear: Ghost Babel* within a sci-fi setting where humans exist in decaying cyborg bodies.\n\nYou awaken hunted and without memory, and soon learn of a cult/organization that is developing a way to hijack bodies (effectively erasing their original hosts). However, doing so also erases the memory of the hijacker.\n\nThe first ability the player learns is how to hijack bodies without losing his memory. The player meets a detective investigating the cult/organization who later becomes vital to the story when the player finds their vacant body. Meanwhile, time reset mechanics are introduced with the save system. [EDIT: Literally loading save files to reset.]\n\nOne of the last abilities the player learns is to ""reset-hijack"" wherein the player can hijack a vacant body, except back in time to the point the body first became empty. When the player goes back to the detective to do this on their body for answers, the player effectively goes back in time and gets to witness his previous character doing all the things he did before. [EDIT: To clarify, you ""load"" a save file belonging to the other character and now you play the rest of the game in their body.]\n\nAt the end of a final confrontation, the player (still in the detective's body) is trapped in a room with the player's original body laying vacant on the floor. The game ends when you time-hijack and find yourself back at the start of the game.\n\nIf you choose to start up another game, it's like the main character kept his memories this time. Since the you (and the character) had all your abilities all along, you get to sequence break early on to take a different path. And in that story path, perhaps discover how the detective became the player character."

860dpt,Engineer doing repairs on a spaceship,"Basic premise: you know how in Star Trek when the ship gets attacked the captain starts shouting ""Divert power from cannons to shields"" ""Increase the engine performance"" and things like that? You would be the guy in the engine room getting the commands and trying to do everything accordingly. \n\nThe game would be first person, running around while juggling different tasks in a hectic non-stop action. The entire game would take place in the engine room. Either single player, but co-op multiplayer is also possible. (maybe even better, having to coordinate tasks, or designing 2-player tasks) \n\nGameplay could include: \n- Switching power focus as needed as you hear the commands from the intercom.\n- As the ship gets hit random system can catch on fire, you would need to extinguish the flames.\n- As important devices/parts in the room break, you would need to repair them\n- Some systems are powered by batteries, that you would need to change every now and then, and putting the depleted batteries in a charger (like in Subnautica)\n- A computer terminal could get system errors or hacking attempts that you need to fend off\n\nI imagine these tasks as simple minigames. Quick-time-events, button mashing, timing (click when the moving square is inside the colored rectangle) and other simple/quick puzzle games.\nThe tasks would be simple to do but you would be overwhelmed by the different things happening and would need to do it fast.\n\n[example: you hear a notification that the central terminal is being hacked, you rush to the screen, press E, have to do a single snake game collecting 3 apples quickly then do a short typing game. ""Hacking attempt thwarted."" ] \n\nIt would be also important to somehow balance it so there are more important problems that need fixing, so you don't just fix everything in the sequence they occur, but have to think and act accordingly.\n\nVictory condition: survive as long as the battle is raging (survive X minutes)\nDefeat condition: ship has multiple meters (hull, internal systems, life support, engines etc.) and if some of them reaches zero, it's game over. Failing the minigames would cause the ship's according systems to take damage, or continuous damage/seconds while flames not extinguished.\n\nTo increase difficulty different mutators could be introduced:\n- Hot steam coming from a pipe blocking a corridor.\n- Poisonous gas in a section that need to be cleared before you can access said section.\n- Light turning off occasionally (or perpetual darkness and you use a flashlight)\n- Enemies boarding and entering the room? (need to hide from them or dispatch them)\n\nThe player could also have a health bar and sometimes take environmental damage so you also have to pay attention to that and waste time by applying bandages.\n\nSo that's the general gist of it. What do you think?\n\nPS: typing it out, it seems like a first person ""Overcooked!"" on a spaceship, but I like the idea."

85xauj,A game about Colonies,"You are the governor of a colony in the new world/asia in the 1600s, you begin with a short into where you personalise your faction, choosing your home nation, Your personal focus, and your colony's focus, all of which give you a range of buffs and debuffs to work around, there are other colonies in your area, and your challenge is to eventually break away and become a free nation, this is done through war, trade, or diplomacy. Think of it as colonization in EU4, but massively expanded. \n\n-Gameplay:\n\n- Native treatment and wars\n\n- Slowly nationalising trade(deciding prices, breaking free from home nations economic control) \n\n- working towards technologies and 'acts'(special bonuses)\n \n- culture plays a big part(Independent-integrated/Learning from natives- Aggressive expansion, also affected by tech, and h0w much of your weapons and tools are imported)\n\n -Economies that require you to adapt(e.g: your home nation creates a new colony that turns out to have  a huge amount of the product you rely on, and they are weaker so sell it for cheaper prices, meaning your economy grows weak, and you need to either get a new resource or diplomatically affect the trade prices)\n\n-Dynamic event chains."
85wktb,Cell Micromanagement,"A top down micromanagement sandbox game about colonising a simple but harsh open world environment. The 'world' is simply a range of biomes with different conditions rather than landforms, so you have to rearrange your cell to most fit the habitat. \n\nYou build the cells out of blocks with different properties, like cytoplasm or membrane or chloroplast or flagellum, including more complex things like light receptors and lenses. You have no direct control over your cell, and instead program responses to certain stimuli (like light falling on a receptor) through a pseudocode-like programming language. You could unlock new building blocks through reaching certain levels of biomass or by having a population above a certain size in a particular area or biome."

85prcn,A Game About GHOSTS!!,"After watching a brother yell at Fortnight for a good hour, I asked myself; **what would a game be like with little to no action?**\nI’ve developed this idea, with only strategy and puzzles in mind.\nThis game is about ghosts.\nMore specifically, Gaki, ghosts in Japanese folklore who are cursed with insatiable hunger. As creepy as it sounds, I thought this would make for a cool world building experience.\n\nY’see, in this game concept, the gods aren’t content with **just** making you hungry all the time. They also demand you prove yourself worthy of heaven by improving the lives of a set number of people.\nYour character (haven’t thought of a good name yet) still has to help 16 people, equating to 15 people and a tutorial. I get games. Laugh.\nProblem is, she’s a bit of a slacker. And if she can’t achieve this goal within two in-game weeks, she’s cursed for eternity and can **never** gain access to heaven.\n\nHere’s where the main gimmick comes in. I have no idea how close much past four way movement, so that’s why I’m having **you guys** do it for me!!\nBeing a hungry ghost, your character can be affected by hunger. Shocker, I know. If you go too long without eating, you move slower, become agitated, and other such side affects that I can’t think of because my fat ass hasn’t been hungry since I was four.\nMost quests are time based, and if you want the best ending, you need to help all 16 people. But you also have to think of yourself. Want to steal the food out of a store? Steal the food out of that store, but **oh no!!!** Thomas and Sara can’t meet there now because you closed it down! Want to scare the hell out of a little girl? Scare the hell out of that little girl, but **oh no!!!** Now you can’t return her precious Barbie doll after she drops it at the park!\n\nI think you get the idea. Anyway, I thought this would make for a fun, hour long, $5 Steam game, if anyone’s interested.\n"
85pcnv,"a scifi battle royale where you compete in a spacecraft instead of an island.

85lhrm,Psychological horror Escape The Maze Game,"I have an idea for a game that I'm going to work on soon. Your player will be locked in a completely dark multi level maze with only a flashlight. They'll have to solve puzzles to open doors and evade dangerous traps. But this game needs a horror element. I want some kind of creature to be wandering the maze that you have to avoid, or you die a horrible death. I'm also going to have an intense story about why you're in the maze, but I'm still working on that.\nHas this been done yet? And what other horror elements would i want?"
85gjdt,"""Color Value"", a team-based game of converting your enemies","Imagine a team of identical red members, each armed with only a red laser that overheats slowly when used. A full laser blast without pausing \(meaning you shoot long enough for it to overheat, causing it to short out and be inoperable for a few seconds\) is enough to deplete \~35&amp;#37; of an enemy's health. Each member of the enemy team, the blue team, has a similarly functioning blue laser.\n\nWhen you finally get an enemy down to 1&amp;#37; of ""blue health"", and you shoot them again, they don't go to 0 and they don't die. They instead go to 1&amp;#37; ""red health"", and become a member of your team. Shooting your teammates also increases their health of your shared color, though at half the rate. The goal is to convert all of the players to the same team.\n\nOther modes could include VIP mode, where a person starts neutral \(0 color value\) and has to be protected by one team in his journey from point A to B. Or Fish In A Barrel, where nearly everyone starts out neutral, and one or two people have color values, and they compete to turn as many people as possible. The new members may or may not have the ability to shoot, depending on the game mode.\n\nI imagine Color Value as a third person cartoon\-ish game. It could easily have several teams, but things could approach a point of diminishing returns beyond three, I think. And having the team members looking identical isn't required, obviously, as long as the color is evident and the hit box pretty much the same... But I think adding variance in gameplay mechanics \(especially weapons\) for characters is a slippery slope. What I read of Splatoon suggests to me it can be balanced, but I imagine it can be done wrong far easier."
88eulb,Judge Dredd: The Telltale Game,"My idea for a game is a game like Telltale's Walking Dead or Telltales Batman except it stars my favorite hero judge Dredd.\n\nIt should be playable in VR so it can feel like you are wearing a helmet and have a lawgiver controller that explodes if you fail to uphold the law.\n\nIt would be like the ""shame coat"" from the walking dead.  If you met somebody who played the game and their hands were clean you'd know they'd upheld the law while people with scorched/stitched/missing fingers didn't."
88blht,Friday Afternoon Game Idea Jam,"As a creative exercise, let's try to come up with game ideas based on a theme and a constraint.\n\nTheme: **Free-fall**\n\nConstraint: **No firearms**\n\nWhat game would you make based on this theme and constraint?"
889629,I need help with what game to make with the following constraints: Offline-Game. You shoot with a Cube Gun. Cubes stay on the place after launch.,"Not sure: can walk trough cubes or not?(Seems interesting) If you can walk through, then you'd be hard to see for opponents and you can walk through the cubes. If you cannot you can't walk everywhere when you shoot 1000 cubes in a small place. \n"

88823q,I have an idea,This would be a survival game a lot like don’t starve but it takes place in a abounded town and it would have a 80’s-90’s feel to it.\n\nAll of the items would be upgrades to your damage/health/speed/etc as well as healing. items would be things like snack foods or cassette tapes or action figures. (They would be like discontinued snack or old toys) \n\nYou would be able to craft these items with certain things by finding certain crafting objects(like a canner to make sodas or a tape recorder to craft tapes.)where you can place and make a base with. \n\nThe enemy’s and bosses would be like references to old movies or tv shows too. \n\nSo that’s my idea for a game. Is it good?(.-.) 
887zgq,Alien simulator,In this game you would play a alien come to earth. It would be arcade like with high scores and points every time you destroy something. There are five levels and a time limit of 3-minutes and the goal of the game is to destroy as munch as possible. The levels would go as follows in this order.\n- small town \n- Area 51\n- Roswell \n- Las Vegas\n- White house \nEach level would have a special bonus points if you destroy special things like the space ship on the Area 51 level or killing the president in the White House.\nSo that’s my game idea. 
885kv4,Challenging Concept: A turn-based strategy game with free exploration. But how?,"How could a turn-based strategy game (e.g. Disgaea, Fire Emblem, etc.) be made to work with the free exploration of action adventure games (e.g. A Link to the Past, Hyper Light Drifter, etc.).\n\nThat is to say, your player characters are always in the overworld and battles/encounters always take place right in the same overworld. Moreover, the mechanics that govern the turn-based strategy fights are the same as the ones used to traverse the overworld. **There is no separation between exploration and battle.**\n\n****\n\nHow do turns work when there are no enemies on the screen or field? How do you streamline exploration/movement so that it doesn't become annoying? And how can exploration be changed so that it *needs* strategy?\n\nI believe most of this was solved with RTS games. Enemies follow their general patterns/instructions even when off-screen. Control of units are made to be as effortless as possible thanks to the mouse and keyboard. Lastly, the time element, resources and fog of war means you're playing with strategy even when you're just exploring.\n\nI'm almost sure the same (or similar) can be done with turn-based strategy, and even expanded to work in an action-adventure or action-RPG sized world. Do you fellas think it could work? How would you do it?"
885jlj,Stalingrad,"Hey guys! \n\nI've had this idea for a very long time... \nFinally I have a chance to finally talk about it to more people!\n\nLet's get into it:\n\nThe very simple idea of the game is that it's like a weird mix between ""Tom Clancy's The Division"" and ""CoD WW2""\nThe game will be set in the town of Stalingrad during the second world war. (A bit of info about Stalingrad for the uninformed: Stalingrad was one of the (if not the most) important battle of the Second World War, around one million soldiers died in the fight for Stalingrad)\n\nThe game will open up with Anton Petrushev, A young farmer-son in the Soviet Union. Antons life is very simple, he plans to become a logger like his father but soon the world erupts into war. The german army quickly pushes to Stalingrad and Anton is sent into the city as a private for the Soviet Army, without any training he is basically a dead man walking. The young man is sent across the Volga river where the player learns how the shooting mechanics work by having to shoot deserters dead in the water (think ""Enemy at the Gates""). Soon you reach the other end and introduced to the Russian HQ, an NPC leads you around the base and shows you where you can do what. In the middle of the tour you are sent off to do your first mission, an attack on a german fortified building. As you march through the broken streets of Stalingrad, civilians will be seen running and hiding, screams, gunshots and dead bodies will be everywhere. \n\nOnce your squad reaches the building a whistle from an officer is heard, all men stand up and pray as they run into the chattering fire of an MG42 in the building across the wide street. Wheter you make it or not here is up to you...\n\nWhen Anton and his squad takes the building theres hand to hand combat, here the player will have one chance to win, if you die during these sections, the game moves on the second story (explanation later in text)\n\nOnce youve taken the building and bunkered down, artillery starts shelling your location, the whizzing sound of Howitzers is all you hear before the building crumbles. \n\nThe camera cuts to a warm and happy summer day, in the middle of a grassy field, it pans up to a field of skeletons with lit candles next to them, the camera hovers over one of the skeletons and the Plack over the skeletons head is translated to English letters:\n""May the soul of Anton Petrushev, Rest In Peace""\n\nHere is where the ""second story"" begins, the game now gives you a cutscene of german and soviet troops fighting, theres a cinematic sequence of fights and hand to hand combat as a voice speaks about how many casualties were taken and how Stalingrad shaped history with its sacrifice.\n\nThe speech finishes with ""Now it's your turn, to shape history...""\n\nThe game fades to black and this is where the free roaming, faction picking, looting and exploring is left to the player.\n\nTL;DR \n\nA game like the Division set in Stalingrad that allows almost full player choice and exploration.\n\nI would love to discuss further more detailed Ideas for the game with anyone who is interested, Thanks for reading!\n"
882or2,"A sim/management game where the player's goal isn't to make the town/company/building/whatevs prosper, but to make HIMSELF prosper.","The idea is to make the player want to sacrifice the prosperity of the place he manages in order to make himself wealthier or more powerful.\n\nAlthough I don't know how the reward system would work, the player would be incentivized to make poor people suffer so the player could get a bigger yacht. Or he'd be incentivized to overwork employees while he cashes out in company stock before news of working conditions become public. Stuff like that.\n\nThe player would need to carefully manage being beneficial to his constituents/holders and taking personal advantage.\n"

87t3zz,Luck Master -VR,"TL;DR- You know that game where you have to keep the baby alive? This is kind of like that except you’re trying to keep a guy from dying horribly as he does innocuous things, in VR so you’re actually navigating the room to alter things before they wind up killing him. \n\n\nThe game follows the luckiest man in the world, though he’s only that if you the player do your job right.\n\nYou’re presented with a scenario, the man has to accomplish some menial task, maybe he needs to do the dishes, or cross the street, or just sit there watching TV. While he’s doing these things there will be many things you’ll need to watch out for and adjust so that he doesn’t wind up dead. Things like wet spots on the floor, fire hazards, electrocution, a murderer at the door, you’ll need to utilize motion controls to manipulate the environment to keep the man alive. \n\nYou’ll be doing this by interacting with the environment, pick up a plate and smash it to draw his attention before the grill he was standing over explodes, pinch a dog so that it turns and chases him across the street so he moves faster and gets out of the way of a truck, sometimes the accidents he sets in motion aren’t instantly fatal and you’ll have a little time to recover and get back on track, or if he’s heading for an instant death it might be wise to lure him over to a less deadly instance. An example being he’s got his arm in the garbage disposal trying to get a ring back, before it eats up his hand and he bleeds out, you could knock over the candle on the dining room table and start a fire that grabs his attention, you might want some water handy for when he goes to deal with the issue as he is no fire marshal.\n\nThe gist of it is this, simple situations with deadly ramifications in need of your intervention. At first the levels are pretty simple, with the guy kind of bumbling from one mistake to the next, but as you go through they get more complicated with certain problems only arising as a direct result of your intervention. \n\nThis game is primarily for laughs, though it’s a bit grim and brutal when you fail, overall this game is supposed to be funny.  A stylized, cartoonish art style I think would benefit this game the most. \n"
87snyg,Single-enemy MMO,"First things first, this isn’t me asking anyone to make a game, this is me with this idea in my head and wanting to put it down somewhere.  If you go ahead and comment something like “too big scale, indie developers can’t make this” etc. just know I don’t care and already understand.\n\nWhat I’m thinking about in this game is, basically, a whole group of users of the MMO aiming to defeat a single threat.  This threat isn’t constantly present, like a boss to beat or a thing to get.  This is an invasion that occurs once in a given timeframe.  Maybe it’s a month, maybe it’s a year, maybe it’s more or less.  The threat can be a wide variety of things; maybe it’s a giant monster, maybe it’s an army, maybe it’s not even enemy-based but something like a virus.  The threat would change with each iteration, and the developers could give hints here and there to help as they see fit.  While players in-game can grind to make themselves stronger, the main part of the game is actually on the outside, in the form of the community getting together to form a plan, twitch-plays-Pokémon style.  There are certainly things to prepare in the main game, like resources and defenses, but large-scale strategy needs to be an integral part of the combat.  The map doesn’t need to be a gargantuan sprawling map, just big enough to be a small kingdom. \n\nTl;dr: an mmo community needs to defend against impending enemies that come once every few months/year, using the time to prepare."
87mlvm,Do ROM hacks count?,"The title says it all, folks. I am simply asking if ROM hacks of an already existing video game are allowed on here. I actually currently have an idea in mind which involves the game Project X Zone 2 and mixing it with... another franchise that I'm not comfortable with bringing up just yet. By which I mean, replacing characters, areas, and some music with characters from that other franchise. So with that being said, what's your answer?"

87lkzf,Not a game but a feature I feel is missing in mostly all games.,"I recently installed Arma 3 again and remembered, that as a lefthanded Guy I will need the next three to five game sessions to adjust my controls (3-5 Days). Arma is an extreme example, because it is a control chaos for PC gamers (if you are lefthanded). So my Idea is basically to implement a system to the tutorial which let you choose your controls in that moment the tutorial asks you to do something. A intuitive keymapping system if you will.\n\nFor example: Most tutorials ask for you to get a feeling of the controls. ""Use 'Q' and 'E' to zoom in and out"" or ""Use WASD to walk"". So instead of giving you the controls, it gives you the power to change them while playing. For example: ""Press a Key to bind Forward, Left, Right and Backwards and move around the map"". I think I saw something like this in the past. This would make the tutorial more interesting, the keymapping more precise and leftis wouldn't have to stay outside. Because i can't be the only one who is really pissed at the limited control options, when it comes to left handedness. I am a IJKL person instead of the normal WASD and Arma is almost unplayeble for me...:("

87fgnb,Idea for Red Dead Redemption 3,"For ""Red Dead Redemption 3"", they should make a black protagonist. It would be cool to see the old West through the eyes of an African American gunslinger. Many cowboys in the American West were black after all (although they were cattleman outlaws. I know). He could be like a Slave turned Civil War soldier who goes West after the war to become a rancher. \n\nThey could do alot with the AI interaction too. As you walk into new towns and locations some people don't like you, for obvious reasons, and they stare and insult you. This can change as you gain their respect as the story progresses.\n\nI think something along these lines would be cool to get after RDR2.\n"
87b4dm,City builder game but with Rymdkapsel-style aesthetics,"I really liked Rymdkapsel's minimalist design, but the game itself was too short and arcade-ish, i.e. there is progression.

87ac00,Sandstorm Roulette (Cowboy Fast Draw),"**DESIGN**\n\nA multiplayer PvP game based on the wild west cowboy gun duels.\n\n2.5D, Characters can be a minimalistic 3D and backgrounds 2D pixel art.\n\n**BASE STORY**\n\nSandstorm County, One of the Richest Counties, has been invaded by a large mass of Greedy Bandits. The Law doesn't exist anymore and it's every Bandit for him/herself. Large amounts of money are up for grabs and various bandits search and kill for just an eagle (gold coin). Now you're not gonna miss out on the fun so as you wake up from a state of being unconcious, you pick up the nearest dead man's gear and venture into the depth's of hell searching for eagles.\n\n**HOW IT WORKS**\n\nI've barely played any multiplayer games so if I use wrong concepts go ahead and correct me.\n\nYou begin by setting the amount of eagles you shall bet. You cannot set a custom amount, there are various fixed amounts you must pick. Matchmaking will match you with another opponent who has bet the same amount of money.\n\n*Bullets are required to enter a match. You can buy them with your eagles but they are slightly expensive, they auto generate each day if you have no eagles.*\n\nAs you enter the game your character is engulfed by a sandstorm and at this point matchmaking begins. The sandstorm blows away and infront of you is your opponent.\n\n● Both opponents must choose in which chamber of their  revolvers they want to place the bullet( You can only place one). \n\n● Then the chambers are spun and stopped by the player but from a side view so that you don't know where the bullet is.\n\n● The players then choose their strategy, such as if the character will crouch, stand still or jump and how they will pull their guns out of the holster.\n\n● The players face back to back and take ten paces(steps away) You cannot shoot until the tenth pace. Once the tenth pace has been reached the player must click to first draw out his gun. If the player chose Up draw, the character will draw his gun in a circular, arching motion starting from the top all the way to the bottom( This is good if you predict the opponent might jump). If the player chose Down draw he will do the opposite, Bottom to Top which is good if the opponent crouches. During the arching motion the player can click to fire at any time but he must time this correctly if he doesn't want to miss.\n\n● If there was no bullet in the chamber or the bullet misses, they run back to each other and take ten paces again or they can take 10 more paces from their current position(Not sure about this.)\n\n● When one person dies you collect his eagles and walk away into the matchmaking sandstorm and to a new location. Note the first bullet that hits is the winner, the other one does not count afterwards.\n\n**GUN TYPES**\n\nThere are 4 different revolvers with different stats:\n\n1.Heavy Revolver with 3 chambers but with heavier and slower bullets.\n\n2.Light Revolver with 4 chambers but lighter and faster          bullets.\n\n3.Heavy Long Barrel Revolver with 5 chambers but lighter and incredibly fast bullets.\n\n4.Light Short Barrel Revolver with 2 chambers but heavier, weaker and very slow bullets. It would require two bullets to kill opponent. ( This gun seems a bit OP, Not sure about it.)\n\n-Heavier Guns, slower Draws.\n-Lighter Guns, faster Draws.\n\n*All these guns are available from the start and players can choose whichever they want before placing the bullet in the chamber.*\n\n**PHYSICS**\n\nThese will be exaggerated for more fun:\n\n•Higher altitudes, Thin air. Lighter bullets are much faster\n•Below Sea Level, Dense air. Lighter bullets slightly fall in a curved trajectory.\n\n•Hot Day, Thin air...\n•Cold Day, Dense air... \n\n•Wind can change bullet trajectory\n \nNote: Heavy Bullets tend to maintain muzzle velocity so they won't lose that much speed.\n\n*Gun Condition can also deteriorate due to dust collection or damage from falling or being hit by a bullet. This can cause gun jamming, Slam fire( involuntary gun triggering) during paces and the gun exploding on your hand instantly killing you. New Guns must be bought if you want to avoid this.*\n\n**COSMETICS**\n\n●Clothes Customisation\n●Gun customisation\n●LeaderBoards\n\n**Fun Additions, Not necessary**\n\n●Heavy guns blow limbs off, Light guns slip through and spray blood.\n\n●Getting shot anywhere besides the torso, head and dominant arm can cause injuries. You don't die but you may be at a disadvantage until you can get a new body part from a dead opponent.\n\n●Shooting someone close to the head can blow his hat off allowing you to steal it if he is dead.\n\n●Wait till the clock strikes Noon to shoot.\n\n●Tournament system where you can watch other players you are competing against and also win a grand prize.\n\n●Local 1v1 multiplayer or a practice mode with slow motion to help beginners.\n\n*Basically this would be a casual game. Reaction time, Draw time and Luck add a small layer of strategy and tension.\n Not sure if there is a game like this or if this can be a fun game. All you do is click.*"

86za57,Moba Style Fortnite?,First of all I am no developer just a throwing something out there.\n\nI've been thinking about a teamfighting moba style battle royale.   You can make it 4 or 5 player teams you make a giant map and you place the teams at different spawn locations.  When the game starts teams can run around the map and defeat mini bosses / npcs for gold or kill other teams to purchase types of items or skills to gain stronger.    Teams can consist of any kind of team comp preferable with a variety of roles such as healer or support/tank/ranged physical/mage/assassin/bruiser\n\nOver time the map will break apart and grow smaller and smaller until the last team is standing

8bilew,A visual novel in which you're a bartender trying to get your customers to open up (using a deep conversation system).,"The game unfolds like a cross between a visual novel and *Papers, Please*, in that you spend workdays behind the bar as you deal with multiple customers.\n\nThe conversation system would let you select a subject that your target spoke about, and prod them about it.\n\nSo if a customer brought up a dog in passing, you could highlight the word ""dog"" to hopefully lead the conversation in that direction. On top of that, you add simple modifiers to frame your inquiry. So it's not just about what you ask, but *how* you ask it.\n\nThe goal is to steer conversation to get your customers to tell their intriguing personal stories. Through the course of several days, you get to hear many stories unfold. Some are funny. Some are sad. Maybe you help them deal with their problems, or maybe you discover a mystery.\n\nAlthough *mechanically* this game would be simple to execute, the stories and dialogue would need a professional or experienced writer. This might not be for beginners."

8bhk5e,Multiplayer Zoo Artillery Game,"In this game, each player controls a zoo where they can breed and raise animals.  They also build out defenses around the Zoo, a la Clash of Clans.\n\nEach Zoo also has a massive cannon for attacking other Zoos.  The twist is that the projectiles *are the animals themselves*.  You can fire a Lion into your enemy base and it will start attacking things, or a moose (which will block things), or an alligator (which will lay in wait and ambush nearby animals), etc.  The animals will all have simple AI (again, like Clash of Clans).\n\nI've also got an idea for a sequel based on warships, rather than land.  My working title is *Noah's Ark: Survival Intelligently Designed*\n\nThis all occurred to me within two minutes of waking up this morning; funny how that happens sometimes.\n"
8bd16q,Anarchism the game,( I was thing a mix between pay day and hotline Miami) I was thinking about a game where the goal of the game is to get to point A-B without dieing but you need to get enough points to go to the next level. You can earn points by destroying things or throwing gas canisters and just generally doing stuff that a anarchist would do. But before every level you can pack your bag with stuff and you would have a carry limit and you need to do something with others. Like if you have a gas canister you would need a gas mask to not die for the gas. Story wish I was just thinking about you just being annoyed by all the politics and you final break and just want to see the world  burn.
8bcd9a,An RPG crafting game where you brew Potions and enchant equipment with lots of different combinations and techniques!,"After reading about complex magic and crafting systems in Fantasy and LitRPG novels, I've developed quite the thirst for a game which allows a deep crafting system involving Alchemy and Enchanting.\n\nI'd like to be able to utilise a deep magic/crafting system to create things.\n\nThe general concept is an RPG style game where you *craft only*. Whether you be an Alchemist, or an Enchanter the concept is that the game will involve manually crafting things.\n\nBeing an Alchemist would mean actually putting ingredients into a cauldron, processing them, and bottling your end product for sale, or trading to your friends.\n\nBeing an Enchanter would require *knowing* the game's runic languages and how to inscribe the letters onto equipment (using a magic enchanting knife, etc.), while also knowing what each letter does. Letters would have different colours (symbolising different elements), and different combinations of letters would produce different enchanted effects.\n\nIf the idea ever took off, then later updates could add different runic languages, alchemical techniques and apparatus; and maybe even add a method of ""seeing"" the effects of your potions and enchanted equipment in action somehow.\n\nBut currently I have no such grand delusions. A simple text saying ""this potion grants increased dexterity"", or ""this sword creates rifts in space"" would be more than I could ever hope for in an initial release.\n\nPrimarily, the game would be a social/experimenting one whose selling point would be the massive amount of potion/enchanted effects you could get by mixing things together.\n\nEventually, if it went far enough, the social side of the game could also be developed.\n\nMade a cool potion? Place it in the mailbox and send it to your friends! Feel like *pranking them*? Send them a Potion of Unrelenting Laughter! Discovered a brand new enchantment/potion? Mail it to the Enchanters/Alchemists Guild and claim the glory of being the first player to discover it!\n\nLooking for a particular potion/enchanted item? Place a request to the Alchemists/Enchanters guild and have another player brew/enchant it for you!\n\nThe possibilities are endless, and the best part is the player would simply be confined to their Tower/Dungeon/*insert fantasy dwelling of your choice*, during gameplay thereby minimising the actual 3D asset work that needs to be done.\n\n**tldr: making potions and enchanting stuff in a vast system where you can send the stuff to other players and socialise with them.**\n\nI'd personally say it would take some experience to implement such an idea simply because of the massive amount of recipes, combinations, and spreadsheets you would need to keep track of. Also, maintaining an online place where players can submit creations, mail each other, and look up existing recipes would take some work I assume."
8baeuc,Multiplayer collectable genetic breeding game,"Not so much of a game idea as a ""help me design a game idea"" submission. Just looking for some fresh input and any pointers - sorry if missed the point of this sub (not intentionally!)\n\nIf you haven't heard of Crypto Kitties (https://www.cryptokitties.co/), it's a kind of CCG which makes clever use of Ethereum smart contracts. It made some noise a few months back and completely clogged up the network for a short while due to Ethereum's current poor scalability. The idea is, basically, cat breeding. You can buy a cat, find someone else's cat for it to mate with and voilá! you now have kittens that you can sell or breed further. The cool bit is that the kitten will inherit its parents' genetic properties, with a certain degree of mutation so you can potentially create a unique breed with rare properties. That's pretty much that.\n\nWhat I had in mind, was to borrow from the Kitties in terms of its:\n\n* CCG nature\n* decentralised ownership of collectables (cats)\n* genetic mechanics\n\nbut to also throw some natural selection into it. That is, to allow the agents to compete with each other for domination in some form of regularly organised ""battles"", where winning is incentivised by prizes, breeding privileges etc. which, in turn, would incentivise collectors to breed better agents.\n\nTBF, what the ""battles"" would actually look like is something I am trying to work out but the properties would be:\n\n* Fully autonomous, i.e. not requiring user input (the goal is the agents' evolution, not collectors')\n* Multi-agent (ideally unlimited number) per single session\n* Deterministic - given the same inputs always produce the same results\n\nThe closest thing that comes to mind, in terms of game mechanics, is Hattrick - a browser-based football manager game I used to play over a decade ago. It's a sort of game where you log in once or twice a week to tweak a few parameters, maybe make a trade or two and just leave it running by itself mostly.\n\nMy current thinking is to make the game about primitive organisms (think bacteria or viruses) which evolve by gaining/losing/modifying certain traits and attributes(types of food consumed, reproduction rates, aggressiveness, metabolism, speed of movement etc.) and can be sent to ""battle"" against other organisms to test who can survive the longest in some sort of cellular automation competition.\n\nIn a nutshell, this is my concept. I am obviously missing a bunch of important details, such as what algorithms to use for battles, genetic mutations etc. Oddly enough, I have more answers for the ""Hows"" of the concept than for the ""Whats"", e.g. I at least know where to look for how to run the battle computations of arbitrary (within reason) complexity in a trustless and decentralised way but struggle to find what the computations should actually be.\n\nSome of the areas I'm currently scanning for ideas are cellular automation, genetic algorithms, neural networks or the parts I can at least, vaguely make sense of, mostly hoping to find any low-hanging fruit - I'm not an expert in AI but I'm OK at copying things :)\n\nMy dream goal with all this is to implement the game mechanics with a bare minimum of visualisation (think grids, text inputs and JSON files) as an open-source code base in Rust (the language), for fun and challenge. The blockchain and decentralisation aspects are not really the target, as long as I can keep it decentralise-able at least in theory.\n\ncriticism, help, advice, good examples to look at, questions all welcome, please!\n\n\n\nP.S. A couple of fun demos I stumbled upon:\n\nhttp://beltoforion.de/article.php?a=simulated_evolution&amp;hl=en\nhttp://evolvejs.com/\n"
8ba6s1,Hero shooter with customization akin to the titan customization in Titanfall 2.,"I thought titanfall 2's titan customization wojuld work excellently in a regular hero shooter. You get two types of perks for each titan; one perk tier with upgrades that are available on every titan (extra dashes, lower ult cooldown, etc), and a second tier that has perks exclusive to every titan (change to the titan's weapons, upgraded abilities, etc)"
8b7ud1,Remaking my first game: DigiMiner. A unique platforming twist on the classic game Minesweeper!,"I've come a long way since I developed my first game. I have finished several other projects since then, and I finally managed to get published on steam with my first commercial release as well!\n\nWith all the new experience and skillsets I've learned over the past five years I thought I might go back and do a remake of my first ever game.\n\n**DigiMiner**\n\nDigiMiner started as a 2D platformer where you played a minesweeper stuck in a grid of squares. Some of the squares were explosive, but some of them were safe. You accumulated score by shooting out the safe cells, but shooting explosive cells would cause a giant explosion that could potentially kill you if you didn't manage to escape the blast.\n\nAs I developed the game I added special cells as well that had a variety of functions:\n\n * Teleporter Cells: These cells teleport you to the opposite side that you shot, destroying any cell in the way.\n\n * Bouncy Cells: These cells cause the player to bounce up and down, increasing your jump height.\n\n * Black Hole Cells: These cells clear out a radius of cells around them (even explosive cells), you can shoot them multiple times to increase the size of the explosion (1x1, 2x2, 4x4).\n\nSince I'm remaking the game I want to start fresh from the ground up, but I thought I'd give some background about the first iteration. This game shouldn't take me too long to develop a prototype for so I will be posting live updates as I start developing. I'm planning on doing this game jam style over the next few days and into the weekend. \n\nLeave some ideas below! I'm looking to really shake things up in this remake."
8b723w,A Puzzle Game Played Inside Your File Explorer Using Shortcuts to Other Files,
8b6041,An adventure/flying game about surfing in the sky.,"On a strange planet that was colonized and then abandoned by Earth, a naive but eager adventurer finds himself embroiled in the conflicts between the remaining colonies and aggressive sky pirates.\n\nI had to explain the setting so that the gameplay would make sense.\n\nIt's a ""flying"" game that takes place mostly in the sky. The planet is full of floating islands and exotic wildlife that swim in the air. The atmosphere is draped in some sort of dense (but invisible) energy waves that creatures and plants had evolved to float in. The remaining human colonists developed ships, boats and gliders that can sail the energy currents as well. The protagonist, however, uses something that looks more like an oddly shaped surfboard.\n\nI hesitate to use the word ""flying"" because it's more like a surfing/jet-skiing (think Waverace 64) but in the sky. The protagonist is unique among the other humans in that he can sense surrounding pressure waves. To the player, it is shown as transparent waves at his altitude, like a glassy ocean surface, with limited range. To gain height, the player has to jump of the crests of the waves. However, to gain speed the player must ""pump"" by jumping before the peaks (just high enough to clear them) and releasing after the crests to push away. Once the player finds a good rhythm, he can reach some pretty intense speeds. Or you could get easy speed by *diving*.\n\nAt the higher skill levels, the player can perform ad hoc tricks (i.e. unscripted &amp; from the mechanics only; like what you'd consider tricks in Rocket League) to aid in traversal or combat. For example, if the player was about to slam into a cliffside, he might twist to safely scrape and push off of it with his board. Or he might do a backflip off of an intense wave to dive straight down with force.\n\nThe challenge of the game comes navigating the routes efficiently, all the while outruning pursuers, chasing your next meal or engaging in limited combat with pirates. It might be the sky, but in this planet the sky isn't empty. The sky looks like a corral reef teeming with caves, floating canyons and all the wildlife within it."
8b48qr,Foreign Planet Survival,"Basic concept:\nan event leads you and a team to escape in pods from a spaceship from a hostile force. You crash land on the planet, and have to survive, either by sending out a distress beacon for your allies, or by eluding the hostile force for long enough that they abandon the search. The planet is a large, randomised place, with all climates and areas, with it’s own flora and fauna, with which you can craft things, build things or create weapons to fight off the people searching for you and your team. \n\nMore elaborate version (sorry, a lot of reading): \n\nThe event starts off with ship combat, my idea being randomised or customisable, where you might start as a group of prisoners that have to escape a slaver ship, or hostile forces ship as POWs, or as body guards for a emissary that seeks to make peace with this group, before you are betrayed and have to fight your way out to the escape pods. There could be a number of different stories here that start the adventure. \n\nYou and your team are customisable, and perhaps be specific classes that can help with the game (an anthropologist: who can identify creatures and plants and can craft special items based on that knowledge, doctor: self explanatory, can heal and help your team, perhaps creating stimulants and other things to help with fatigue or boost you in a fight, the engineer: can build special things, and can do it with less resources, navigator: who can map out things and find points of interest based on his or her geographical knowledge, and others if you have suggestions). \nDuring this time, you can scrounge for things to help you survive, by killing guards, or looting storage areas, etc. You can find weapons, armours or crafting items that can help you in your survival adventure. Then:\n\nYou get into the pod, and start for the planet. It can be customised that you could choose your destination, or randomised, but basically you crash land, whether that be in a jungle, snowy mountain, lush valley, large plains, ocean, desert, or tropical island. Each land has it’s own unique flora and fauna, much like our earth, where you may find large predators, like massive wurms in the deserts that are huge, or cat-like creatures, etc. You build out your pod to make a little colony, or you travel and hide from the people chasing you. You can play it how you want. \n\nThe people will be trying to locate you, so you have to be vigilant in case you see their drop ships, or troop movements. You can of course take these guys down using guerilla tactics and take valuable resources, otherwise lure large scary animals to attack them and reap the benefits of that. \n\nAnd you survive. That means eating, sleeping, etc, depending on how hardcore you want the experience to be. Eventually, you can create an elaborate device that sends out a distress message to your allies, but they take a while to get there, and the enemies will be able to find your location on the map, so you need to be prepared. Otherwise, you wait a long time, by surviving and whatnot, and the enemies pack up and go. But if you keep attacking them, they will keep coming after you, as they know you are there. \n\nSo a coop survival sci fi game, pretty huge in scale, but would be amazing. What do you guys think? I understand that this is an unrealistic game to make, but this is a game idea, and I thought it was pretty cool. \nThanks for reading!"
8b3gf7,Cool vr headset idea,"Something that would be cool as a app is, for a vr headset that you have to have measure the size of the room you are in and you enter that size into that app. You would let you play random types of games or challenges. someone respond and let me know if its a good idea.!?\n"
8b37nu,1920’s industrial themed rpg,"Ahhh, the 20’s the year of the industrial revelation and the top hat. I want to make a rpg with a theme of a factory filled with pipes and gears. It would be dark colors and tones. All the weapons would be something like a pipe or a wrench or some other tool. What do you think of this type of theme?"
8b36g0,Fun rpg themes,"I want to make a rpg but with a theme different to the regular medieval or magic sort of game. I want to make a game with a different theme, got any ideas. "
8b2npd,Mechanic idea - realistic inventory,"This isn't an idea for a full game, but just an idea for an inventory mechanic - probably for a survival game or something similar.\n\nMost games have inventory systems that are wholly unrealistic. Your items are displayed in a menu or a grid system that has no relationship to how people really store items. A character can have 3 shotguns, 4 machine guns, 50 grenades, a rocket launcher, 6 medpacs, 50 pieces of iron ore, etc., and they can still run without breaking a sweat. What I'd like to see is a game with objects that are realistically modeled with the proper size and weight, and containers (mainly backpacks, with holsters/bandoliers/etc. for equipped weapons) that are modeled realistically as well, and the player has to physically store items in their backpacks and/or holsters, and only things that will fit in these containers will fit in these containers. This means displaying the inventory system as a group of full 3D objects that you can manipulate in a 3D space. And their weight affects player movement speed. If you are carrying a heavy backback and suddenly get into a heated firefight, you can drop your backpack temporarily in order to move faster - but of course, this realistically would carry the risk of having your pack stolen! (Of course, whoever steals it would also have to deal with the weight/size of the thing, so it might be hard for them to get away with it.)\n\nObviously, this will make inventories much smaller (of course, you can store items in chests in your home base, in a similar fashion.) But I think this would lend itself well to a survival game where everything is scarce anyway. You really have to make decisions about whether various items are worth trying to make room for.\n\nWhat do you think? Too tedious?\n"
8b2j1i,Urban legend game,In this game you play one of a group of friends going to a ghost town that is said to have some spooky past. But when you get there you get there there are people there even thought it was supposed to be abandoned. Something would make you stay and your friends start acting weird after and while and the people are acting weird to until you have to fight some sort of dark monster and you can final leave. Many at the end you could have a chose of leaving your friend and the final boss or saving them and fighting the boss.
8b2ale,80’s dark souls,What it there was a dark souls game but instead of a castle you are in a giant mall and have to fight monster but instead of dark colors everything is neon and bright. You could fight with colorful toys.  I was thinking gameplay similar to Skyrim or dark souls. The mall would have different obstacles and themes depending where you are.
8ayw19,Adventure in a hoarder home,I was watching hoarders and I thought about what if you your like a government sanitation worker and you enter a home where it’s all gross  and have have to find the owner of the home.

8avbo4,Cold War strategy game,In this game you play ether the capitalist USA or the communist Russia. At the beginning of the game all country’s are neutral at the begging  but you can invade country’s and take them over after a turn or 2.

8av77h,90’s rambo game,I was thinking a metrovania like blood dragon but with tons of guns to shoot. I was thinking it would basically be every 90’s cartoon ever in one. The best part is the action bar where when you kill enemy’s it goes up. The more it goes up the more damage you do and more enemy’s spawn. I’m thinking a ironic cliche of the save the innocent girl for the evil monster sort of story. Would you play this? 
8av16b,[Intermediate] You are a space alien disguised as a human elected to be the president of the USA,"your goal is to find a way to destroy the earth and eliminate humanity, but in such a way, that nobody suspects you, therefore you don't get impeached or assassinated."

8aprms,A game where you're at the end of a zombie apocalypse and you have a job to clear out infected buildings.,"**safe house and missions**\nYou have a safe house where you can manage soldiers and their equipment. This is also where you browse the city map and choose buildings to descend through. Consider your needs for the mission. In need of medical supplies? Choose a hospital building. In need of weapons and ammunition? Choose a police station. When departing, you will be taken via helicopter and dropped onto the roof of a building. Then you begin your descent. \n\n**soldiers**\nI haven't given thought to a maximum number of soldiers, but up to 4 can go on a mission including you. You can actively control 1 and the other 3 will be ai. If a soldier dies they are lost for good. If all 4 soldiers die, you lose their equipment as well. When recruiting new soldiers, they will have only a pistol to start with. If you get more than 4 soldiers, you can send the extras off for a completely ai controlled mission. When you complete a mission that will pass some game time required for the ai missions to complete themselves. \n\n**checkpoints**\nI'd go with procedural generation for the kinds of buildings in the city and the building interiors. Towards the end of a floor, there should be stairs or an elevator to go to the next floor AND a window that is not boarded up. Using some kind of signal flare will let you signal a helicopter to pick you up or get more supplies (send a soldier home / get another in his/her place, get more ammunition, etc). You can choose to take everyone home from there and the building will reset. You can leave 1-4 soldiers behind to keep that point secure so you can return later (assuming it's a good randomized location that has yielded many supplies!). I also had the idea to allow players to take a crowbar with them, to pry boards off a window for an emergency checkpoint. Haven't given much thought into balancing that or if it would be more fun to allow any random window in the place to be opened and signaled from. Maybe you barricade a room because the building is swarmed and you aren't prepared - find a window in that room and you can extract your crew and go do an easier mission.\n\n**misc**\nI'd say the number of systems involved make this a project for a group of amateurs or 1 intermediate dev who knows a game engine really well. I'd love to make this game myself but it's been in my idea book forever. Game could work as either 2D or 3D. I didn't have many ideas for a story but for the sake of some kind of satisfying progression, maybe when you secure a whole city you gain some kind of passive bonuses and can then move on to another city. So we have infinite replayability and small bonuses for each completion. "
8ankba,Horror game where your a kid I a hospital,I now the the horror game where you play as a kid and horror game that takes place in a hospital are over done but I just wanted to throw my idea out there.\n\nYou play a little child in a hospital I you are trying to escape (I know original) but the thing is that you have no way to attack but still have a life meter and there are creepy and gross enemy’s like how a child would see a sick person or a doctor. I was thinking they could have voice lines and they would sound like splicers from bioshock. I don’t know about this idea the more I Write about it. 
8amou5,Audio FPS,"I’ve had this idea in my mind for a while but haven’t fleshed it out or prototyped it cause lazy. But the idea is a FPS with no graphics (just black screen), instead you rely on 3D audio to tell you the position of other people based on foot steps, gun shots, reloading sounds, etc.\n\nA variation would be the same thing except when a gun shot happens you can see it and whatever it lights up for the half a second the flash happens. That would make it a bit more fun i think since you’d have to make sure you really want to fire before everyone can see where you are.\n\nAn obvious downside is you’d probably spend 90% of the game in a corner aiming at a wall but like i said it hasn’t been fleshed out lol."

8aj8ez,"A fighting game wherein the only way to win a round is to get a long enough combo, and taking damage makes you easier to combo.","A twist on the Smash Bros damage formula, except instead of damage making you fly further, it makes you easier to juggle/combo. Otherwise it looks like a regular fighting game.\n\nWhen a fighter first takes damage, a combo meter appears that fills up like a reverse health bar as he takes more damage. If it fills up, the round is lost. However, if he manages to hit the enemy, the meter disappears altogether and now a new one appears for the opponent.\n\nThis means a ""combo"" doesn't necessarily mean a continuous string of attacks. Rather it just means consecutive, unanswered \nattacks.\n\nSeparate from the combo meter, there is also a damage gauge. This keeps going up indefinitely. The more damage a player has taken, the longer their hitstuns last.\n\nOne last change from traditional fighting games: Fighters have more defensive options during hitstun. In this game, fighters can perform directional blocking during the last half of hitstun. This special type of ""stun blocking"" only negates the *damage* of the blocked attack but also skips half of its resulting hitstun. It's used to help break out of a combo.\n\nThis gives players defensive options while they're being juggled in a combo, so they aren't just sitting around waiting for it to end. Since those blocks are directional, offensive players have to do a lot more mixups to either keep opponents locked or to ""recatch"" them in a lock.\n\nIf all goes well, this will result in an exciting back-and-forth of combos as skilled players break out of one just in time to deliver a devastating combo of their own to win the game."

8ae1b0,Best of the worst,In this game you play a stereotypical villain (bowser looking) when you see all the other villains and you make it your goal to be the best villain ever. There would be different themes depending on where you go and who you fight. It would be metrodvania like with platforms and you shooting fireballs at your enemy’s.\n\n(For dlc you can fight the president of EA)

So I was thinking they could all shot and you would get less shots the less people there are. "

8a2lf2,A game in which you become a Russian nesting doll of monsters.,"You kill large monsters to wear their bodies like a power suit, to kill larger monsters to wear like a suit, to kill even larger monsters... so on and so forth.\n\nAs you become larger the world scales smaller (think either Katamari Damacy or 2D fractals) allowing you to reach places you weren't able to before. Each ""level of scale"" has multiple types of monsters with different abilities, so sometimes you'll be hunting for specific monsters.\n\nThe game is set in a world in which preserved corpses can be commandeered with magic. So long as you fit inside them, at least. The village hunters use monster bodies to hunt for larger monsters to bring back as food and resources.\n\nThe more monsters you stack on, the harder it is on the mind. If pushed too far, the hunter could lose his mind, forget he's human and regress to the state of mind of the monster he's piloting.\n\nSome time ago, a fellow hunter never returned. Around the same time, the village started getting attacked by a colossal monster. You and a team of other hunters are tasked with going into the wild to track down the missing hunter and get some answers."

89xapw,Gaming Platform that gets your game ideas crowdfunded and lets you invest in games,
89x3hm,A CCG Based on Pro Wrestling,"Pro Wrestling is an interesting take for games, in one case you can make a Virtual Sim such as Fire Pro Wrestling or WWE 2k..Or you can make it a campy over the top act such as WWE All Stars. But what if it was a collectable card game?\n\nYou could have cards that do a lot of things, action cards could be pro wrestling moves like a Piledriver or a chokeslam, you could have character cards be parodies of famous people like “Hash Hogan's Rasta mania”, or the forgetful tag team – “The Legion of...Who?”\n\nThere could be ""Stipulation Cards"" which change the rules up, so for example if I play Steel Cage, grapple moves do 2x more damage. Characters can have damage counters which affect different body Parts. So, if your heads damage is in read, you're bleeding.\n\nThe Rules can be modeled after pro wrestling. So if you beat an opponents character, you gain a Prize card from a separate pile, if you collect all 3, you have “Pinned” your opponent\n\nThis might seem like a strange idea, after all, Pro-Wrestling is niche enough, But as a novel idea, I think it works fine!"

Master of defense (minister of defense) - he builds walls, traps, energy barriers and towers around the city, researches upgrades, etc. Trying to protect his city and farms. Towers need energy that's supplied by energy generators built by builder.\n\n2. Master of attack (general) - he trains troops using barracks, thinks about tactics, where and how to attack, coordinates normal and special attacks like airplanes (not available to train) and researches upgrades.\n\n3. Master of finances (builder) - builds farms and houses to get income and population, banks to store money (increasing possible income), laboratories to increase the speed of researches, and energy generators to power towers&amp;laboratories. He also controls the capital with special options, like dividing income between players - 20% for general, 30% for himself(builder) and the rest (50%) for minister. Or activating people rush.\n\nTowers&amp;Units:\nThey would be divided into 3 tiers. First one contains primitive units like barbarians, catapults etc. Second one cannons, soldiers etc, and the last one modern technology, like tanks and rocketeers. Trained units substract population, for example barbarian by 1, tank by 10.\nThe same with tower tiers - archer towers, cannon tower, tesla tower, sentry, etc.\n\nIn laboratory players can research new tiers for units&amp;towers and attack/life/durability/income upgrades.\n\nOne match would last around 15-30 minutes.\nWhen the capital gets destroyed, team loses.\n\nI imagine it's more a game for smartphones/tablets than for PCs, due to its repetiveness, but who am I to judge? :P"

89i66h,A horror game wherein the controls are purposefully unintuitive and the movement clunky.,"For an extreme example of what I mean: **Clock Tower meets QWOP.** The protagonist has been drugged and kidnapped, but manages to free herself. Now she's trapped in the killer's labyrinth and the drugs haven't worn off yet.\n\nSometimes, awkward control and movement just fits a game. In a horror game, it could add an extra level of tension as you panic to remember what button you want to press to get away.\n\nThe idea I had in mind was one in which the protagonist, an engineer in a robot factory, is injured and hotwires a piece of equipment to move around. But the player literally controls movement by touching wires together in an open panel.\n\nSteadily, and after many close calls, the engineer cobbles scrap parts onto the lift until, by the end, they're operating something like the Power Loader in Aliens.\n\n****\n\nAs long as there's a legitimate story reason to why the player has to use unintuitive, clunky or awkward controls, the player will understand it's part of the core challenge instead of feeling cheated. The added layer can make a tense situation even more hectic. But most importantly, mastering the difficult controls can mirror the protagonist turning the tables on the big bad(s) which is a fantastic horror trope.\n\nI remember wrestling with the controls in my first Resident Evil game. The controls were awkward but *consistent*, so by the time I started the game a second playthrough, I had gone through the same character arc as the protagonist: I was no longer the scared hero as I was at the start. But the key for this is that the controls have to be *consistent.* Difficult but fair."

894jy3,Idea for new mobile game - inspired by Final Fantasy's Triple Triad,"So I've been on the fence whether to develop this or not. To me it would be fun but I was explaining the rules to my wife and she looked so bored.\n\nAnyways it's a homage to Final Fantasy's Triple Triad game if you've ever played it.\n\nIn my idea, the playing board is a 5x5 grid. You are on one side, the opponent is on the other side.\n\nYour game pieces are tiles with unique paths on them, and each one has a number (or power level) associated with them.\n\nThe tiles for example could have a path leading from the north direction, to the east direction. (imagine a clock reading 12:15). The paths always meet in the middle, and a single tile can have anywhere from 2 to 8 leg segments. (The higher leg pieces are more rare).\n\nThe point of the game is using the tile pieces, you must make a path from your side of the field to your opponents side of the field.\n\nEach player starts off with 8 tile pieces and gains an additional tile piece (up to a maximum of 8) for every captured opponent tile piece.\n\nThe triple triad part comes in at this next part, and is a little confusing typed out, so I'll use bullets I suppose.\n\n* If a player places a tile onto the grid, the game checks if that tile is surrounded by any opponent tiles.\n* If it is, the game then checks if the tile the player placed has a path pointed at the opponent tile. If it does, the game also checks if the opponents tile also has a path pointing at the placed tile. If they both have paths facing eachother, they battle. If the placed tiles number is higher, the opponents tile is captured (flipped over and becomes the players tile). If the placed tiles number is lower, nothing happens. This occurs with every tile that the placed tiles path points to. If the opponents tile doesnt have a path pointing at the tiles location, it's automatically captured.\n* If the opponents tile is captured by battle (not automatically captured), it will start a chain. The game checks if that captured tiles paths point to any other opponent tiles and repeats the above. This continues until theres nothing else to check.\n* The game ends when a player successfully creates a path from their side to the opponents side.\n\nThe above is the rules for a normal game, there are other game modes that add special rules to the game as well (mostly borrowed from triple triad).\n\nI'm on the fence whether to build it or not. Feel free to adapt the idea into your own if it sounds interesting to you."
891f0z,A game about editing film.,"A game that looks like simplified video editing software, in which you are tasked with editing scenes to make the most sense, and then are graded at the end of each.\n\nIt could be used like ""baby's first film editor"" to teach the basics of editing.\n\nThe game would come with all the live action camera footage of short film(s) with multiple simultaneous camera angles, multiple takes, establishing shots, lots of unnecessary footage, and extra audio. The player would use that library to try to follow the director's notes (the objectives) to cut individual scenes.\n\nOnce you're done, you submit it and get a rough grade based on how well your cut followed the notes/objectives.\n\nThe game would start simple with easy to understand techniques, [such as delaying camera cuts to lag behind the audio](https://youtu.be/CsYwKZGkaWU?t=69) in dialogue scenes. As the game progresses, the scenes get longer and more complex as the objectives become more difficult and the library gets larger.\n\nMaybe all the footage in the game is for a single long movie that comes together, or maybe the footage is of multiple short films, but it would all be original. This way, players could make their cuts public for the fun of it."
890j6w,Hunger Games: The Official Game,With Fortnite and PUBG being so dang popular it would be a crime for say Ubisoft (or someone else?) to not make this game ASAP. \n\n\nThere's guaranteed money involved since the movies are semi-recent and the genre being this years defining genre (so far at least). There have obviously been copy cats like Minecraft Hunger Games but an official Hunger Games branded game is an itch as of yet left unscratched. There could be a campaign following the movies as well as a bigger online Battle Royale mode. Waddya think?

You’d have a map of locations you can go to, not just airports, but towns. You need to know the basics of flying a plane, similar to a game called jalopy, and travel between the markets on the map hoping to not get intercepted. \nAt the beginning you will be weak and defenseless, but as you progress you can buy guns to strap to your plane, maybe even buy a new plane, until you reach the boss, which is a division of fully armored bombers. \n\nTl:Dr: FTL but in a bush plane with fuel, oil, etc to worry about.

88nh29,"Teen superhero action RPG, more freedom with character creation / powers, plus cel shaded graphics","It's exactly what it sounds like, but there's more to it. If there was ever a well done *and* executed game based on original Teen Titans or Bang Babies from Static Shock, it would be this.\n\nA game where you are your own custom teenage superhero or villain, and you're in charge of everything from the default look to the costume to what species / human ethnicity, etc. Whether you want a cape, fangs, or special Cyclops-styled glasses - or EVEN the option to make your character blind - ALL this and more is at the introduction. It's *superheroes*, so it'd be more diverse with who your character is than, say, Skyrim, with the same default races and minimal effort to make them look different, which quickly becomes a hassle.\n\nYou can go on different quests, and there's a stronger emphasis on in-game decision making than Fallout New Vegas. Sometimes the world may blow up if you fail, or something smaller like the villain gets away, you failed to kill the hero etc. You'll receive a Moral Card overtime depending on what methods you take to save people or destroy corporate buildings. \n\nNow for the fun part: POWERS AND ACTION GAMEPLAY. For a game like this there should be frikkin' hundreds of them to choose from, and they aren't boring or the same generic ones relying on combos, like in DC Universe Online. The city and background is mostly able to be destroyed, and the graphics are cel shaded, meaning it looks both like a game and a comic book.\n\nAnd there should be minigames...God I can't remember the last console title that had these. Along with a free play mode that's non-linear to the campaign, there should be minigames where you can hang out with NPC heroes or villains in typical teen hangouts ( pizza parlors etc ).\n\nThere should also be multiplayer akin to Xenoverse, but more superhero oriented ( and of course with your hero or villain ).\n\nWhat do you think? I've always had a fondness for young adult heroes 'cause the theme of responsibility in fighting crime and becoming an adult in general mix so seamlessly. Only adult hero I like is Green Lantern. :/\n"
88k2gz,An over-the-top sidescrolling shooter with Liero/Worms controls.,"Some of you may not know [Liero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2yi60-grHs). It was basically Worms in real-time.\n\nInstead of having the standard controls of sidescrolling shooters, such as Contra, the controls were a little different. There was an aiming reticle in front of your character which dictated what angle you were aiming at. Instead of up and down buttons aiming straight up or down, the up/down buttons moved the reticle up or down to change the angle you were aiming.\n\nI feel like this control setup hasn't been fully capitalized on yet. That's the sidescrolling shooter equivalent of analog sticks for a first person shooter.\n\nYou may ask, ""but elheber, don't we already have keyboard &amp; mouse controls for side-scrolling shooters on PC? They're far superior just like mouse &amp; keyboard are equally better than analog sticks for FPS."" Why, yes, they are better **BUT** they both equally also come with one big disadvantage: *couch co-op.*\n\nOne of the best things about classic sidescrolling shooters like Contra and Metal Slug were playing with other people on the same screen.\n\nThe Liero-style controls also have an added layer of skill attached to them that lets the action be more frantic. The action becomes less about precision aiming and more about spraying and explosions by nature. A game like this is built for hectic explosions from cluster bombs and erratic shooting with miniguns. That could make for a great and unique single-player/co-op sidescrolling shooter.\n"

88gh9e,A fighting game Tekken style with the characters being the ex-presidents.,
88fvmm,Blackout,"Background: Over the course of history, countless stories have been told of the constant struggle between two forces: Light and Darkness. Almost every one of these stories depicts the creatures of Darkness as ruthless, evil, and terrifying monstrosities. However, contrary to whatever you may have been taught, this is not always the case. Not every creature of the night is evil. It would take the slightest bit of common sense to realise that one is not simply BORN on that path. Light, however, isn't typically the most forgiving. In the early ages of the planet Earth, Light and Darkness once lived together in... somewhat peaceful harmony. There would be the occasional argument, however the forces were still capable of maintaining a good relationship. But one day, a creature of the Dark felt as though the living creatures at the time did not give the night as much glory as it thought they should have. This particular Darkness was tired of Earth's population prancing and playing in the day, whilst sleeping in, ignoring, and occasionally being afraid of the night. And so, the creature of Darkness, along with others who felt the same, attempted to commit what was at the time considered to be the ultimate sin: everlasting night. The creatures of Light were infuriated and outraged. They ultimately put a stop to the predicament by slaying the group responsible, but they did not forgive, nor forget. Light, jumping to conclusions, began to feel that no creature of the night could be trusted, and considered them all to be ""corrupt"". They declared war. It was at that point in time that absolute hell broke loose. Light was merciless in its attack, wanting to eradicate the planet of all Darkness, even going so far as to annihilate those who were completely innocent. There was one family in the legion of Dark that was barely able to defend itself. It consisted of a mother, father, and their single, beloved daughter named Blackout. Desperate to protect the child from the inevitable death of her population, the mother and father used their combined powers to tear open a portal in time and flung her into the future, where they hoped the war will have ceased. To Blackout, the whole scenario was a complete blur. The last thing she remembered before losing consciousness was her parents' smiling, crying faces. When she came to, she saw a completely different world; new life forms, new cultures, and... not a single creature of Darkness. Blackout proceeded to sob immensely, horrified by what had happened to her people. However, she eventually stopped, got back up on her feet, and thought about what to do. Eventually, she came to a conclusion: she would seek out the ruler of Light, the one who had declared the war in the first place, and try to convince him to bring everyone back. However, she has to be careful not to attract too much attention. If these strange, two-legged creatures stirred up too much of a ruckus, then the forces of Light would seek her out and try to bring about her end. Blackout is determined to achieve her goal. For the sake of everything she loves... she WILL achieve her goal!\n\nGameplay: Adventure across Earth to find the ruler of Light. Duke it out with dozens of types of enemies in an attempt to find your way to the source of this king. For the most part, stay as hidden as possible. You don't want to attract any unwanted attention. But who knows? You might come across the occasional new friend. With a combat system similar to the Bayonetta games that allows you to pull off intense combos and varieties of dark magic, you can use experience obtained through battling enemies to purchase upgrades for your powers, or even new ones at that. Hide in the shadows and eavesdrop on civilians in an attempt to gain information for your next target.

8frygb,A new Battle Royale game with actual innovation,"Beginner to Intermediate\n1 game \n2 seperate lobbies\nPlayers are numbered from 1 to 9 in each lobby\nIf something happens to you or you kill someone, it also affects your matching number player in the other lobby, everything affects the matching number, even looting chests\nBonuses or debuffs from a caster (Like in Darwin Project) are the result of the choices your matching number made\nafter killing the last player in YOUR lobby, you face the other player.\n\nIn my mind I imagined this darwin project-like game. Complexity that is simply explained was my goal and I hope the vision that these few ideas created is understandable \n\nAlso thought about team and duo play but Ill get more into that if you're actually interested in trying out whats possible with these fundamental ideas\n"
8frjf3,"RPG with an ""Absolver"" like combo-editor","Hey!\n\nHere are some key parts of the game:\n\n\* Top down \(Zelda/Pokemon perspective\)\n\n\* Being able to learn different moves: like attacking from different angles, faster/slower attacks or debuffs. On your main attack \(left click\), you can then chain 3 moves together in your combo\-editor for your individual playstyle.\n\n\* Right click will then swap to your 2nd weapon \(and maybe 3rd\), which you can also edit with 3 moves. \n\n\* so your sword, your magic staff and your bow each got 3 attacks you chose when clicking left click 3 times in a row. Swapping weapons will then go into into the other weapons' combos.\n\nMight still need something to make it less repetitive and give it more skill based\-feeling.\n\n\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\n\nExample \(if you don't know what I mean\):\n\n\* You got a combo editor outside of combat. After beating a boss/finding a scroll, you will learn a new move for your combo, which will NOT automatically be added.\n\n\* After a while, you got for example 5 moves: simple slash; sword sting, circle\-attack; charged strike and so on.\n\n\* You can now customize your left click with chaining 3 moves. So you could maybe put 1. sword sting, 2. charge strike and 3. circle strike. Both the order \(1. 2. 3.\) and the different types of moves can be swapped.\n\n\* Your bow and your staff also have 3 moves per combo each.\n\n\* Pressing right click will trigger a special attack with the next weapon and also swap to it: You got sword \&gt; press right click \&gt; swap to bow and trigger a special bow attack. After bow follows the staff \(but this order can also be customized\)."

Stealth would be the core mechanic, one side being the sneaky-peaky boys, the other side the guards who try to catch said sneakies. The spellthieves would have minor utility spells, like feather-falling and limited invisibility, turning into other objects or whatever, with the wizard -being an actually trained wizard- having access to all your favourite spells like fireballs and such, and the summoned guards would probably not be spellcasters.\n\nLevel design would be an absolute nightmare, since it is a difficult thing to tackle even in single player stealth games, but in multiplayer, where players can exploit badly made levels would make it even more frustrating."

8fiixe,Thought of some more punks to theme a game around.,"(This is like a part 2 to a previous post talking about other punk themes for games)\nDainty punk: this punk would show a world of very stereotypical and girly things like unicorns instead of cars or something like that. Buildings would look smooth and clean and graphite would look like little kids drawings. Imagine if someone like tiny Tina ruled a city.\n\nDynasty punk: this would show a world with a ancient China dystopia feel to it. Weapons would consist of samurai swords and  other ninja weapons but they would have a futuristic twist to them. Buildings would mainly look like old temples too.\n\nGrim punk: this theme would be dark and have a goth feel to it. Everything would be dark and dimly lit. Many monster enemy’s and characters would be based on old horror movies and dark comic books. Many areas would be dark and gloomy places like alleys or graveyards to give a few examples.\n\n(Funny extra) crude punk: this would simply be just towns filled with crude people and jokes. Buildings would be stuff like strip clubs and record stores. Also all the characters would be rude but comedic. Borderlands is a good example of this.\n\nThis was some more punks for game themes, like then? Got any other punk ideas?"

8fdqvt,A chess game with lag. I know that doesn't make sense; but it will.,"This is a bizzare idea—even by my standards—so bear with me for a little.\n\nIn trying to explain how online multiplayer games work to someone, I used chess as an example:\n\n""When you play couch multiplayer, it's like you're playing chess on a chess board. But when you're playing online multiplayer, it's like each player is playing on *their own* chessboard. Not only that, but each player is playing with their opponent's old positions. There's a delay between when one makes a move and when that move shows up on the other chess board, meanwhile the other player keeps playing without waiting.""\n\nThis game is more of an exercise in game design than anything else. Online multiplayer games do all this in real time. Now... *can you do it with chess?* I think you can.\n\nYou would have to set up rules for which player to side on when they disagree on what happened, but it can be done. ""No way! I already moved my piece out of the way!"" It'll feel unfair, but the key is that it will be unfair to both players *equally.*\n\nIn regular lag chess, the delay is by turn. The opponent's pieces are always one *turn* behind on your board.\n\nBut in lag **speed** chess, the opponent's pieces are always one *second* behind, so you have to keep up."
8fawdv,Interesting Idea,What do you think guys about survival game in Auschwitz?
8fab8r,A puzzle game where you must solve a chessboard within a certain number of moves,"I've been tossing this idea around for a bit. It's pretty self explanatory - the player starts each puzzle with a partially completed chessboard and must win the game within a given number of moves. Solutions might include moving a single piece multiple times around the board, using a move to capture an opponent's piece to clear the way for your own, or to use special chess moves such as castling. As the levels progress, the solutions become more complex and the player gets fewer moves to use each round. You could even implement a timer for added difficulty or a leaderboard."

8f9gw7,Minimalist game ideas?,"A school project requires me to make a game. The more addicting the better. I want to make minimalist games, yet have no addicting game ideas. Any help?"
8f8yug,A very complex game idea (story and game details),"So recently this idea was inspired from games and tv shows and several other things. But story based it’s still Underdeveloped but if you guys have any suggestions please do tell! It’s about a young girl aged 13 (haven’t thought of a name for her yet but call her subject 004), where she’s the main protagonists. It takes place at a hidden lab (kind like 11 from stranger things but a little more intense) where her memories are forgotten and only knows that she’s alive and given powers. She’s able to use nature’s energy force and use hand gestures to crush and push, pull, etc. Her main weapon will be  2 whips for both of her hands. (Only weapon she can summon) she was given this power to be a test and what her abilities are. But she eventually gets tired of being a lab rat and realizes that there are others with different abilities and powers. She manages to sneak out her room and tries to escape while facing enemies and trying her best to get out. (She’s able to take souls of those with power) but soon while escaping she hides in a room where a giant screen is at front and sees the subject number and the movie starts playing where she learns she has a mother with uncontrollable power. And later overhears that she is becoming extremely powerful due to the unknown reason why it continue to grow. So the little girl sees she has a mother and wants to save her knowing she can probably be able to take that power to save her mother. She meets a nice girl along the way but she’s a failed subject called 008 and has been hiding for some time. 008 is intelligent and created a small gem that releases the users highest potential and form. It can only be used once which is for the last boss fight.\nLike I said story still in the works but I wanted the girl to have a boss fight with her mother where she’s the last boss. And the gem will be used in the middle of the fight where 004 Is given power and her physical form changes. She grows rainbow wings and changes her weapons to do huge amount of damage so instead of whips, she uses chains and her screams would echo. And I wanted to get creative and shoot out rockets from her wings,  (sorta like Pharah’s ultimate from overwatch) but I want it to be a third person View and like a Devil May Cry 4 gameplay type. Anyways she manages to defeat her mother and takes her power but ends her mothers life because of the intense fight. So after 004 is ambushed by the person in-charged  of the lab only to make a dramatic entrance but is killed on the spot by 002 (known as 004’s Sister) where she wanted her mothers power because 004 is too young to hold such power and have a quick fight and in-game you will be able to access her new form at command but would only last for 20 seconds until next charge. So 002 underestimates her younger sister and will make game play a bitch until she recovers to fight you. \nStages for this idea i haven’t thought of much and powers that 004 can obtain from those with power and those other ones with power are basically controlled by the one who was in- charged of the lab. Please leave any ideas or story wise I should fix! Ask questions if needed! Or something you maybe confused about just ask! "

8f6s6j,"A shooter like RS2: Vietnam, but in the future with humans vs Robots","I had a dream about this last night, I was in a game like Rising Storm 2: Vietnam, but it was human survivors fighting the more technologically superior robots. \n\nIf you haven't Played RS2, basically the US has more advanced weapons like attack helicopters, recon planes that can rain down large caliber machine gun fire from really high up, flamethrowers, etc. And they arguably have better weaponry overall. So if you play as the Vietcong you kind of have to utilize guerilla tactics using traps and tunnels to compensate.\n\nAnyway, I was thinking it would be awesome to have a similar concept, but in kind of a Terminator type of world. You would have the rag-tag human survivors fighting against the robots who have superior weapons, drones, robot tanks and planes, laser guns, like in the movies. \n\nSo the humans would have to utilize more guerilla type of tactics to win against the odds. They could have less advanced weapons like regular guns and RPGs and stuff, maybe some anti aircraft guns. They would have to be really tactical against the the machines, being stealthy, laying mines, using hit and run tactics. \n\nObviously the game would have to be balanced accordingly to make it a fair fight."
8f5y3o,Hobo Freight Hopper,"Ride on the rock, cargo, mail or other carriages pulled throughout the US.\nDrink beer and wine, but too much to your peril, it may unbalance you but it might keep you warm.\nStudy maps to find the routes and places to pick up and hop on freight trains throughout the US to get to your chosen destination. \nLook at Freight routes and check cargos to choose the fastest and safest rides. USP freight cargos are fast and go to urban areas, rock cargos can land you in way out places away from civilisation!\nHopping as a hobo carries many risks, avoid the railroad security dudes whilst hopping onto the train (Avoid the Bulls) then keep out of sight through busy areas, enjoy the passing scenery and ensure you have enough supplies from the town you started in to make the journey without starvation, sunstroke, freezing or dehydration. \nWith some luck you will make it accross the US to your desired summer (or god help you) winter plan.\nInspired by my youtube hero STOBE THE HOBO who released countless videos to critacal acclaim with his own piano soundtrack that epitomised his cross USA escapades.\nHis channel is Hobestobe video's on Youtube and he sadly lost his life freight hopping on a bridge in late 2017.\nIf you use this idea, please help me out.\nThanks\nmattleedsuk@yahoo.com"

8f3i3n,"A racing game through gauntlet obstacle courses where the goal isn't on getting first, but rather getting FURTHEST.","The starting line is *packed* with racers. As each player is eliminated by falling off a cliff, getting smashed to bits by giant wrecking balls, blown up by a landmine or whatnot, they are immediately kicked out of the lobby to start another race elsewhere. Meanwhile, the dwindling survivors start seeing a hint of hope of winning.\n\nBut there can only be one.\n\nIf you were the furthest racer along the course when you were eliminated, you stay in the lobby in hopes nobody reaches your distance. Perhaps you only spectate or maybe you get to control something to mess with the remaining survivors.\n\nTo prevent players from trying to play at a snail's pace, the physics and handling would reward high speed. The faster you go, the more nimble your vehicle handles. The normal turn radius of the vehicles is *abysmal*, so players must rely driving fast enough to powerslide.\n\n****\n\nAesthetically, the game could be anything from a surrealist take on destruction derby, to a futuristic Wipeout/F-Zero death sport.

8f1rz0,I am a dev and have an idea which you guys can improve.,"Hello,\n\nI am a game developer for 8 years have my own 3 mobile games and worked in 10\+ games in all platforms. I have no professional graphic or character design skills but i have what people calls ""developer graphics"" skill. I have tried to make my own platformer games, indie in house horror games etc. But enough of this. I want to make a game that wont require graphics. And this is the born of this game idea. Anyway enough of me.\n\nThe game is actually not on a platform but it exists everywhere. There will be a website that works with its own ways. For example register button will sent you to a puzzle, if you solve it you will get the register link created for only you to register to be involved in the game. And like register, you need to find a way to login somehow to see the dashboard which helps people find the ""thing \(help me here\)"". There will be quests in the dashboard that lead you to some applications, or other website to find the answer that quest wants. Every quest will reward you with points to go further in the game and find the last main quest \(this quest could be in another app, in another website, in a platform, in a game, or in social media platforms.\)\n\nThe main theme in this game is the ""Scavenger Hunt"". It is like pokemon GO, it will lead you to go outside or stay online at the same time depending on your country or your city. For example in a quest, you will need to find the door number of the Twitter's headquarter in New York or you will need the birthday of Google's CEO or the last name of one of the architects of the eiffel tower.\n\nLet's talk about monetizing.\n\nThis game can has its own way to display ads. When i say ""displaying ads"" everyone will think a fullscreen image of an app or something but it is not like it. A side quest can ask for a thing in another app. For example, it can ask a specific name of Witcher 3 characters. New game developers can contact this game to make a ""SIDE""\(definitely not a main quest\) quest of their own, to display the answer of their quests in their game.\n\nI have so many ideas, and i think i can make this possible with some story help.\n\nWhat do i need?\n\nI have no idea. But we can build a group of people that contacts each other."

8ez0ef,A rpg set in a slasher horror movie,I was thinking what if there was a rpg set in a 90’s slasher movie where your goal was to kill everyone in the town.\nGameplay would be standard turn based combat but with 2 differents. One would be that you could store many different special moves. Like you could have the “HEY PAUL” move where  you spend one turn “setting up” then in the  next turn you would attack a enemy with a attack doing a huge amount of damage or the test trap where you put a reverse bear trap on a enemy’s head and in 2 turns they either get damaged or they get it off. The next idea combat if you kill enemy’s or do certain special attacks you can increase the fear of enemy’s who can away if there to scared enough.\n
8ey0bs,[Mobile] Need Help Fleshing Game Ideas,"I am working on a game that involves satellites and picking up cargo, but I'm struggling with a key ingredient. I have built a prototype, play tested it with an initial group and have settled on my mechanics and design, but I need some loose story to justify some of the limits in player movement.\n\nThe idea is that you pilot a satellite to pick up cargo around various solar systems. Each solar system is it's own level and the only movement ability is the tap, which produces thrust only in the direction you are traveling. You basically navigate the level by utilizing the gravity of the planets around you to collect the cargo.\n\nWhat I need is a basic story reason as to why you can only apply thrust and not turn the satellite/ship manually. This doesn't have to be super deep and really shouldn't be. Think if it like Cut the Rope. The mechanics of the game are good, but you need a reason for what you are doing, so the developers said the items you collect are candy to feed to Nom-Nom. No one really cares who Nom-Nom is or why you need to feed him candy, but you need that little bit of ""story"" to make the game feel logical.\n\nAny thoughts? Thanks!"

8eupw4,"An action platformer except instead of jumping, you can only pole vault.","Let me draw your attention to [Super Pole Riders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQwBuaik9lA), a mini-game designed by Bennett Foddy for the party game *Sportsfriends* in 2014. The basic concept is that you have no jump button and must instead use a flexible pole for all your airborne shenanigans.\n\nIf you're like me, you might be thinking, ""that concept could be refined and expanded to be a full-fledged action platformer on its own."" And you'd be goddamn right.\n\nNot only could the pole be used for traversal and joy of movement, but also for combat. You could whack enemies over the head with it, scoop and launch them into the stratosphere, and push them into walls or over edges (American Gladiator style). I mean, just look at [what Jackie Chan can do with a bamboo pole.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LGY68ppqVk)\n\nThe controls are deceptively simple in sidescrolling 2D; you just need two analog sticks. The right analog stick controls what direction you're aiming the pole.\n\nIt could also be done in 3D using the right analog stick to represent a *hemisphere*, as if holding the handle of a broom. A neutral analog stick is as if you're holding the handle straight up, so the pole is aiming straight down. Holding back on the analog stick is like holding the handle back and aiming the bottom of it straight forward. You'd therefore jettison forward by tilting the analog stick back and rolling it forward.\n\n#### BONUS IDEA\n\nHow using those same controls in 3D [except each analog stick is its own stilt.](https://media.daysoftheyear.com/20171223111242/walk-on-stilts-day.jpg) Such a game would be more about navigating an environment using tricky controls rather than about action; but it could be fun in its own QWOP way.\n"

I'm new to reddit so if I'm breaking any rules or guidelines also please let me know! I just cross posted to r/gaming"
8eoua7,Good dark secrets for a story based game,I was thinking of a story based game and i wanted it to have a dark secret like In night in the woods with the cult and stuff. Got any suggestions?
8eoj09,Battle Royale + MOBA Game,"With the rise of BR games and the strong history of MOBA Games, ehy has nobody thought of combining these 2 games? I thought about it last night and I have some ideas. Feel free to add or to change what I said so that it becomes better.\n\nTeams consist of 2-5 players that play different types of characters, each one with their pros and cons like:\n\n-FRONTLINERS: slow and have shakier hands (more recoil), but have more HP and can buy the best armor and helmet\n-ASSASSINS: fast moving, can buy the highest damage guns and throwables, slim and can jump higher\n-MARKSMEN: have steadier hands, better at shooting long range, can buy the best long range guns, but have extremly low HP\n-HEALERS/SUPPORTS: can heal others using their Aid Kits which are x% effective on each class (x&gt;100). Can buy the biggest backpacks\n-ALL-ROUNDER: viable in all positions, like a Fill, but doesn't excel at anything, neither sucks at anything. Buys best mid-range items.\n-BUILDER: changes the terrain to his teams advantage, buys the best building items\n\nEach character has 2 or more unique abilities with different cooldowns. This sounds strange for a BR at first but I have some examples:\n\n-a healer that instantly revives downed team-mates if he is in a certain range\n-an all rounder that can drive a car at super speed\n-an assassin that can fly for a short period of time to reposition himself\n-a tank that doubles his health/armor for a few seconds\n-a support that highlights other enemies through a the map for a few seconds\n-a marksman that shreds armor faster for the next few shots\n-a tank that stuns all enemies in a certain zone for a few seconds\n-a healer that gives shields to allies\n-an all rounder that can plant trees that grow immediatly (working kinda like fortnite's building mechanic)\n-a tank that draws nearby enemies to him like a magnet\n-a tank that changes himself to a large wall to protect his teammates, taking less damage from all sources\n-a healer that creates a sphere where all allies standing in it are healed a little over time\n-a builder can burn the grass to expose enemies or plant a tree that grows after a short period of time\n-a builder can turn water into ice so his teammates walk on it\n+ so many other abilities\nEach ability consumes energy which restores over time or with an energy drink.\n\nThe map wouldnt be very big but not small either. Kinda like Fortnite's.\nThe zone would work the same as in Fortnite PUBG RoS etc.\nThere are bases on the edges of the map, each team having a base where they can sell the loot they found for gold so that they can buy/upgrade other items. It is more advantageous to find an item that to buy it, obviously, so prices for items are really high. You begin the match with enough gold for some things, like a pistol, armor and stuff like this.\nYou start in your base and after 30 seconds you get into a plane so you parachute  somewhere on the map.\nYou can go back to base only once every 3 minutes and only if you did not take/do damage in the last 1 minute. A helicopter comes to get you, but others can see it and can destroy it before it lands. If it gets destroyed you can call another one in 1 minute, but you gave away your position. Only a certain number people can enter a heli at once. \nGoing to base doesn't heal you, but refills your energy and you cand spend your money on aid kits.\nReturning from base, the same heli brings you to where you came from before going to base, maybe a little further but in a certain range. It stops and others can shoot at it until you parachute. While parachuting you can not be hit.\n\n\nBut what happens when people die? What if the healer of the team dies and thus they have a huge disadvantage? This seems to be the biggest problem with this kind of game but I think I found a solution. You can change your character in game. For example you are an assassin but you healer has died and you consider that your team needs a healer more than an assassin. You become the healer and get all the items of the healer, but you lose everything you had before (you and others can pick it up and sell it tho)\n\nAlso, there is no friendly fire.\n\nGuns have different levels, but higher levels are only available to certain classes. IE, tanks can buy max lv1 snipers, Assassins lv2 and marksmen lv3. You can pick stuff that you cannot use, in order to sell it or to bring it to your team mate.\n\nThere is also a building system which introduces 2 new items: pickaxe (lv 1-3) and some building tool idk. The higher the level, the faster you destroy/build stuff. Of course, different bulding materials take different times to build/destroy.\n\nLast team standing wins.\n\nThank you for reading this. If I come up with new ideas I might post some new ones or edit this old one.\n"
8ellrc,A goofy simulated physics game in which you draw ropes to solve puzzles.,"The player is shown a scene full of soft-body physics objects (think Human Fall Flat, Gang Beasts or Turbo Dismount) that is paused in the middle of the action. For example, a freeze-frame of street with a speeding surfer van and a dummy human crossing the road.\n\nThe player is then tasked with solving an objective by drawing a rope from one object to another. In the example above, the player would be tasked with saving the jay-walker from getting run over. The player might tie one end of the rope to a the dummy human, wrap it around a lamp post like a pulley, and attach the other end to the collar of a Saint Bernard chasing a skateboarder. *Maybe* that's enough to yank the jay-walking dummy from getting run over.\n\nThe fun of the game would come from the ensuing chaos that happens when you think you found a solution, hit the play button and watch the unpredictable disarray of simulated physics unfold. Each scenario would be constructed to be chock full of collapsible scenery and erratic chain reactions so that you probably won't find a correct solution on your first try.\n\nThe first puzzle might be a freeze-frame of a dummy kid swinging on a swing set; one of the chains snapped and he'll likely fly into a loaded BBQ grill and propane tanks unless you can prevent it. You might first try drawing a rope to replace the broken chain, but the kid still flies into the grill because he wasn't holding on to the swing (as you now realize). Maybe next you draw a rope around him and tie him to the seat, so now the kid flips and bonks his head when swinging back... but the family BBQ is saved so you still solved the level."
8eks7n,a rpg where you go from place to place but all the lands a different time period.,"You would play a Scientist who breaks the flow of time and must fix it by fighting the time monsters in each stage. Each stage would have a different time theme and would sell items themed around that period, like one would be a old western town and sell six shooters for weapons or a 50’s themed area would sell Roller skates as upgrades. \n\nThere would be you typical time periods like old west, medieval times, but I wanted to try and add time periods that would be different, like the 50’s and 16 century Britain. \n\nI haven’t really got far yet, so do you have any ideas?\n( I just thought it would be funny to defeat a giant evil monster with a western six shooter and a medieval sword wearing a plague mask from Britain and a 50’s puddle skirt.)"
8ejnxv,Open world post-terraformed Mars rpg,
8ej2th,My idea for a Survival Community Driven Game.,"Hello everyone. I had a game idea floating around my head for a while now and I was wndering what others fought about it. Is it good, bad or simply impossible and sounds awful.\nSo, the idea is somewhat complex in scale. I honestly have no idea if its possible in today gaming world with its current technology or landscape.\n\nSo the idea is based on me and my brother trying to find CO-OP survival games to play. But we always ran into issues be it, asthetic, gameplay or overall design.\nWe looked at RUST, Zomboid, Dying Light, DayZ and many others to name a few.\nThe Idea:\nIts a Single player, CO-OP, online survival game based on the element of community.\nThe overall idea is to have each game connected. Unless you're playing singleplayer, which will have a more focused story-driven, survival feeling with random events and A.I driving player-like NPCs to interact with and fight against.\nSo, what do I mean by connected? Well, take a typical CO-OP scenario.\nI'm building my base, preparing for the typical survival scenario. My brother drops in to help me out. (Drop in/Drop out CO-OP) BUT while he was in his game, he contracted the games main threat a virus. A Biological threat that seems hell bent on wiping out humanity and all life on earth. Everything can be infected, from fish to humans to dogs to cats.\nAs a result of him entering my game, he's now unknowningly brought this threat into my ""world"" It already existed but now its even more of a threat and neither of us are aware of it.\nSomething I always liked from games like Zomboid was the element of sharing and only using so much of something, for example drinking a bottle of water. You didn't need to drink the whole thing. You could take a sip and pass it to another. I was thinking this could be one method of transfering the virus. Others could be blood transfer (You're injured, you spill blood someone walks over it or examins it to see whos it is etc...) or through melee combat (Punching one another or stabbing someone which already has blood from someone else on it) and other methods.\n\nNow, my brothers infected, He's being to my game, he now joins his other friends game and so it spreads. Continues to do so, the virus becomes a community driven event constantly bouncing between games infecting and casuing chaos.\nA way to counter this would be to work towards constructing a bio-lab a kind of blood anaylsis machine designed to detect the virus. Once discovered to be infected introduce new elements of gameplay, Do you want to help your friend to cure it? Kill them on seight? or purosfully allow the spreading of the virus?\nThat's CO-OP elements of the game. Now, Online.\nThis is where it gets kind of insane.\nSo you're playing the game with your friends. All going well, base is coming along nicely defences looking good, people getting along. Then, you're invaded (kind of like an invasion from a Dark Souls Game), A player has entered your game to either, find loot, take yours, cause chaos, or the worst outcome spread the virus covertly or openly to you all, in an attempt to spread the virus further.\nNow this virus isn't just contained within your game. If you're invaded, you kill the invader but for any reason you're infected you, yourself unknowinly go to another persons game or enviroment you could also potentially spread that further.\nSome ideas I had to counter invasions would be laying traps, setting gaurd dogs (NPCs put in positions to defend your home while you're offline, a little like RUST). But, say you're invaded by a non-infected player, simply looking for loot, maybe food and water. Part of the games design would allow for you to place any object be it food and water onto shelves, fridges etc.. Part of this mechanic would also be to combine certain things, like Water with Vitamins to create a more potent and healthy drink. \nBut, you could also, take contaminated blood from another player who has the virus, be it a friendly player or a dead enemy player. And drop some of this blood into the water. You (Solo) or Team (If Grouped) know which bottle of water is contaminated, so you avoid it knowing its a trap. \nThe whole idea of this game is pure survival, the overall story would revolve around this, begin at the start, you'd see how it happened, why and most importantly what steps where taken to try and prevent it. Kind of like hints on how the community may prevent outbreaks or build containment areas for it.\nThe overall idea, would be the story would give background and reason for your pursuit. But in the end, the community and its actions decide how this outbreak will go. Do more players build labs, containment areas and research stations to try and cure it. Trading and spreading this cure among others ""worlds/games"" or do you research ways to enhance it, weaponize it and ensure it does, indeed wipe out all life. Or, do you simply survive, hope to avoid conflicts, stay ""lone wolf"" and attempt to solo, your way to a cure or total chaos. Its all up-to the individual and groups.\nAs a result of this, ""Clans/Guilds"" Or Orginizations, will be formed. Among the community to identify who and what that group does. One may dedicate itself to wiping out all forms of the virus, you're infected? Doesn't matter you die. Some may take a more scientific route, Capturing players or animals for experimination to find cures. Some may decide to form security orginizations dedicated to protection of smaller groups or solo players. Others may decide to form orginizations purely and religiosly dedicated to wepaonizing this virus, spreading chaos, death and destruction among other players games and worlds.\nAs I began to think on thi idea more, I came to the conclusion that one side would eventually win out, either the virus would become so non-threating it removes a vital element of gameplay, or the virus becomes so far spread it infects every server and every inch of the players worlds.\nTo counter this. I figured everything 3 months there would be a server wide wipe. Removing everything. BUT say the virus gained a foothold or it was fought back. There would be elements carried over after each wipe. \n1. The virus overran and the community is unable to contain it. It's over. Evil wins. (so to speak). after 3 months, the servers wipe. Its all reset. But, as a result of this outcome, the games overall difficulty has increased. More infected start at the beginning. (Say, 5% more, which each time the infected win, this % goes up.) the rate at which is spreads is more aggresive. It finds new ways to infect. It begans to infect more things in the enviroment, more types of animals, surrounding nature etc.\n2. The virus is contained, partially wiped out. It's over. It's a stallmate. This outcome would keep the game in balance and as a result neither side would have negetive or positive outcomes. You're back to square one.\n3. The virus is cured. It's over. Good Wins. This outcome will be the oppersit of the bad outcome. Less infected at the start (-5%) it spreads less violently etc..\nOn option 1. The game shifts, it becomes more challanging and focused for though's who wish to cure this virus (or wipe it out). Tho's who wish to ensure the virus survives and infects more people, will also have to work hard to conintue to counter this.\nOn Option 2. The game is still in balance. It would be back to square one. To prevent the feeling of wasted time or the notion of ""Well got nowhere"". We'd ontroduce random event elements to this game state. Increased weather desasters, More wild violent animals etc..\nOn Options 3. Much like option 1, In now becomes the sole goal of the orginizations that wish to spread the virus to double down and ensure this happens to prevent tho's who wish to cure to gain anymore of a foothold.\n\nSo, to present a list of gameplay elements and overall design, I made this list:\nGameplay - \nStarting out: You spawn in a wooded area, you're wearing basic clothing, you've lost your memory and you don't know where you are.\nYour first goal is to find shelter. Littered throughout the game are old shelters, destroyed buildings from the ""old"" world. Your first priority is to search and gain resources (basic survival gameplay) as this stage its more stealth survival, as you'd want to avoid confrontation with wild animals and roaming infected A.I\nBuilding a base: Now you've got basic resources and you (or your party) are ready to begin building, you will need to chose where to go. The map will be large. Lots of wooded areas, small towns and a large city in the center. The City will be an area you can go to from the very start, given you know the layout, understand the threats and are willing to take the risk.\nPart of base building will be much more customizable as its not just a base, it's an orginization. You can build on ground level, create basements, build skyscrapers, create holding pens, farms, small houses, large walls, sentry towers, facilities and much more.\nEach room/building you construct will have a seperate building option, to allow for room customization, finely place items, beds, cuboards and items, trophies from hunts/kills. And much more. You can also, provide each player in your orginization a personal living area, where they can customize it to there liking and log out safely (in defended properly).\nPvE (Player Vs. Enviroment): This will mostly be defending against, wild animals, hunting for food and killing infected to prevent spreading of the virus or capturing, to put into holding cells to research them, for curing or weaponizing reasons (you and your company decide) during this research, you also find strengths and weakness for each time of infected, building research notes, Once you have enough research notes you can then go ahead and produce upgrades towards, the damage you deal or towards increasing research rates towards that infected type.\nPvP (Player Vs. Player): This is where much of the community and its action come into play. Like previously discussed, what the invidiaul orignization or group decides will determin many outcomes. But generally speaking, PvP will be much like any other first-person shooter. But, how you execute/tackle an objective you've set for yourself, or your orginization has established will determin outcomes and possiblities. Maybe you're more covert, prefer to slip in, destory or disrupt research, spread virus strains or place traps and generally cause chaos. Maybe you prefer to infiltrate and observe. Maybe your Orginization prefers outright bloodshed and violence. Maybe you're peaceful, prefer to trade, share research and ensure a cure is found, It's up to you. Or maybe you're a lone wolf, prefer to stay away, only go in when its ""Safe"" to secure items and resources. Maybe you're a mad sniper, looking for victems and don't care, you simply want to kill. Its all up to the player.\nI've ran out of time to go more into somethings, but I will leave with a general idea of the game below:\nIt's a First-person shooter (FPS), with Survival, Stealth and Open-World elements. Desgined around the idea of a community driven virus/cure gameplay arc.\n\nThanks for reading, if you have any ideas or think this is terrible or stupid, impossible or down-right rediculous. Please leave a comment below and I will reply when I'm able too.\n\nApologies for any rambling or spelling errors."
8ehm36,A top down SAW meets portal like game.,"(I know there already saw games with puzzles but I wanted to make a top down game like portal) You would be in a dark building with nothing but a flash light and a crappy map with a letter in the back saying why your here. You could play a wide assortment of characters ranging from a  man who killed a man by accident or a women who had stolen medical supplies from hospitals and each have different skills Fromm more health to getting more time on time limit puzzles.\n\nIt would be a lot kick portal but more gritty and there are puzzles but also bear traps and wire you have to avoid too. There would be little mini games to get pieces to the puzzle and in some rooms there would be time limits to solve the puzzle.\n\nAt the end you could choose to either leave the place right there or go face the man who put you there. If you take door number to you get an extremely hard room with a 3:00 time limit, full of bear traps and 3 mini games to get a piece of a key to a door and it’s surrounded by bear traps. When you get all three key pieces you get to go in the masterminds room and find out why your there.\n\nI thought this sounded interesting  "
8ehhkl,A 2D story focused game where your a little kid in a cult that’s raided by the CIA and must pick a side,It would be a normal day for you in your little cult town where everyone acts friendly and nice until one day you are raided by the CIA and then everything goes to hell. At the beginning you have to chose to either go the cultist rout and help stop the CIA agents or to stop the cult with the help of the CIA. Either way you are told to sabotage the other as you explore your once nice town now almost a  apocalyptic nightmare where everyone is crazy and has a gun. \nYou puzzle solve a lot to get thought locks and to sabotage and it can get hard as you have to avoid enemy sight and platform a bit to get to different areas. \nYou could also talk to people on either side and each has a different story to tell. Like one guy on the controlled part of the town might talk to you and tell you why you town is bad or a girl on the cult side of town might say how she didn’t want to be part of this and is on the CIA’s side.\n\nWould you play this? I would.

8egw0d,You play in a graveyard trying to stop ghost and bring them back to there grave.,"I was thinking of a game like mega man or shovel night with challenging platforming and hard bosses.\n\nYou would go level to level platforming your way to the bosses. It wouldn’t be liner and you can explore levels with all different themes and secrets to find. You could find secrets that tell the backstory of the ghost you fight.\n\nIn each level you could earn points that you could exchange for items in you little shack that is meant to be  the hub.\n\nThat’s all I thought of so far, what do you think?"
8eghps,JRPG set in a theme park with tons of loot.,"I was playing a lot of west of loathing and South Park: stick of truth lately and I wanted to make a  game with tons of loot like armor and weapons. But, it would take place in a theme park, witch means all sorts of different themed loot to equip and places to explore.\n\nI would think the main story would be you having to go to 5 different rides and get something to escape the park. There would also be smaller story’s that you would see on like letters or something on some of the optional places, like a finding out the story behind the some of the ghosts haunted hotel or a worker that is going insane because of the song that plays at his ride. \n\nLoot would be stuff like souvenirs like hats and shirts but can also be things like a cowboy badge or a toy knight hat. They would be in categories like space land or west land and they would do different things, like space land stuff makes you move faster and fantasy land stuff makes you do more damage. There would be subcategories to like creepy or cartoonish. This would make you just do something small like a little more damage or something. \n\nThat’s all I got so far. Like it? Got any ideas for it?"
8d0sja,"Battle Royale, but it's a micro-heavy RTS","Your avatar is a weak unit (in contrast to MOBA heroes/champions), but it can recruit neutral units, which you then use to fight other players. Your upkeep is limited, but units that require the same upkeep are not necessarily equal in strength. Maybe there's upkeep-boosting units on the map, or maybe available upkeep grows as you defeat other players, as an incentive to get into fights.\n\nKilling the other player's avatar turns their units neutral, but dead units stay dead. Max army size would be somewhere around 20 units, with few repetitions. TTK-wise I think it'd be best if units were somewhat beefier than in SC2 but not as beefy as in WC3.\n\nUnit abilities and interactions could be made as elaborate as necessary, e.g. permanent boosts that can be applied to individual units (think PUBG attachments), or special pilot units and vehicles that get stats/abilities based on the pilot, etc etc.\n\nUnit dwellings can be like entrances/portals to an enclosed area, which is larger than the space it takes on the overall map, like underground caves or something, think PUBG houses. Also, there could be worker units that can collect resources and build walls/towers/turrets/bunkers/etc, kinda like Fortnite base-building.\n\nThoughts? Critique?"
8d0l8k,Night in the woods meets earthbound like game. ( looking for suggestions),(I came up with this idea recently that’s why there isn’t much detail) Ok so I wanted a game where you play a kid and you need to make 3 friends by the end of the week or your grounded or something. But you would play in a small town and there would be many kids you could chose. Each kid would have a backstory and a quest for you to do. Like one might invite you to a party and you have to go or one might want you to go to the movies with them. You could find Certain mix’s if friends where the interact with each other and tell more about them. I was thinking many a rpg element where some charterers can do some moves that help. will you spend you 7 days trying to find friend or will you just play you video games for all of them?  That’s all I got so far I just want some ideas for characters or gameplay or something like that.
