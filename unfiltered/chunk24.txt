8cxdv8,Adventure game,"Making a game about the portuguese meeting the japanese for the first time, any ideas on the type of game that it should be?"
8cwtxu,Got any suggestions for this idea,Ok so I wanted a game where you play a kid a you need to make 3 friends by the end of the week or your grounded or something. But you would play in a small town and there would be many kids you could chose. Each kid would have a backstory and a quest for you to do. Like one might invite you to a party and you have to go or one might want you to go to the movies with them. You could find Certain mix’s if friends where the interact with each other and tell more about them. I was thinking many a rpg element where some charterers can do some moves that help. will you spend you 7 days trying to find friend or will you just play you video games for all of them?  That’s all I got so far I just want some ideas for characters or gameplay or something like that.\n\n(As I was writing this I realized how much this sounds like night in the woods meet earthbound  )
8cwr6b,Game show meets dungeon crawler,"Because this is a game show I wanted to give it a 90’s nickalodion feel to it. Everything is bright colors and the enemy’s like almost like cartoons.\n\nIn the game you are on a game show where there are 6 rounds and each round starts with you answering 5 questions. (Note that they can be anything from  like when what’s DND released or what’s 7x5+2?) Then if you get 5-4 right you get a good item, if you get 3 right you get nothing, and if you get 2-1 wrong you get a bad item. all the items would be like pop culture references. Like a good item would be super skates witch make you go super fast but a bad item would be screw-it (it’s a skip-it reference) witch makes you go really slow. Each time you enter the dungeon you would have to find the key to get out, but you could also find a chest the gives you a good item no matter what. You would have to find them fast as there is a time limit in each dungeon and the only You would get your health  back is to go back to the questions. \n\n(Note: you don’t get new weapons you use your fist but some items can increase there damage.)\n\nWhat do you think \n\n"
8cwitg,An FPS set on a steampunk airship,"An FPS set mostly on a steampunk airship, where 2 team members start as agents on the airship, and the other three spawn on a small airplane beside it. Players on the airplane may choose to come aboard the airship via lifeboat (or just gently crashing the plane), or stay in the plane and use the large machine gun located on the roof. The goal is to control the airship by occupying the control room for one minute (more if disrupted).\n\nIf neither team gains control of the airship, or the airship is destroyed with no survivors, it is a draw.\n\nFeel free to critique it. I am definitely unable to make this game."
8cvtro,Adventure game where you can’t die,"Just to make it short and sweet: a game where, when you lose all your health you don’t necessarily die, but just lose a lot of power and become significantly weaker, meaning that you’d have to go back to grind the power back again"
8cv2eb,Set Sail! A game about exploring the new world.,"Set Sail is a PC game about exploring the new world from your ship/ships recovering rare artifacts and claiming land for your king.\n\nThe game is set in the mid-late 15th century. You play as a ship owner who has been tasked by the King of your country to discover new lands. At start there would be three nations to join. England, France and Spain. \n\nOnce you've chosen a kingdom you will be given a bog standard ship and will have to select a crew. \n\nCrew are very important when exploring far off worlds. The better a crew is the more chance you have of discoring rare things in the world. A crew with overall bad navigation, is bound to get lost more often.\n\nThe crew is split up into three parts, Captain, Navigator and general crew. The captain is in charge of the overall attitude and behaviour of a ship. Have a captain with bad leadership skills and the ship is likely to mutiny. The navigator is in charge of directing the ship. Again, having a bad navigator means your more likely to get lost. Finally we have the general crew, these are the guys that pull the rigging and throw the anchors overboard and such. While captains and navigators are selected individually, crew are selected in bulk depending on your ship. If for example you have a 20 man ship, you would be better getting a 15 man crew.\n\nAll crew have the following stats when your purchase them, Strength (their ability to fight), Navigation (direction on land and sea), and Leadership (ability to lead other people). The scores are randomised at the start of a game, with a max of 20 (objects or certain events can increase them above 20), so it's your job to select the correct person for the correct position.\n\nOnce you have a crew you can assign them to your ship. Once you have more than one ship you can move your crew around to another ship. However, the longer a crew is on a ship the better they will be on that ship so it's only worth moving a crew if the positives outweigh the negatives.\n\nThe main part of the game are the missions. The missions tab will give three possible missions at any one time. Each mission will have a primary goal and three optional goals, and a mission length, detailing how long you have to comeplete it. Here is an example mission.\n\nNew Worlds Await!\n\nThere has been tales of new lands to the west, maybe a quick crossing to the far east. Explore 100 miles of coast and see if you can find a crossing.\n\nReward: 3200 Gold.\n\nPrimary Objective: Explore 100 miles of coast on the continent to the west.\n\nSecondary Objectives: \n\n* Collect 5 cases of fruit.\n\n* Meet the Natives\n\n* Explore Inland.\n\nLength: Three Years.\n\n\nThe mission length details the amount of time you have to complete the primary objectives of the mission. You can of course, complete any secondary objectives you wish to and doing so will reward you with extra gold for each objective. When looking at mission length it's important to keep in mind travel time. As an example, the mission may say three years to complete, but it may take six weeks to sail to the coast so you must factor this in as well.\n\nIf though, you manage to complete the missions (whether both primary and secondary or just primary) and arrive back early you will get a bonus 100 Gold for each month early you have arrived. Conversley, should you arrive back late, 100 gold will be deducted from your final total per month up to 600 gold. If you're even later then you will have failed the mission, likewise you will fail if you don't complete the Primary Objective (no matter how many secondary objectives you did complete).\n\nSo, if we're to take this mission, we would need to select a ship (and crew). If you own more than one ship you can send multiple out on the same mission (for extra cargo space) but once a ship has been selected for a mission it must complete the mission and can't be removed. This way you can have multiple ships doing multiple missions at a later stage in the game.\n\nTo complete the mission you will need to select a rough estimate of where you want to go. If, as an example you select a spot 100 miles off the coast, your ship will sail to that point and wait until its low on food when it will return. You're first placement on an undiscovered continent will have to be enough to reveal a decent proportion of the coast to make it easier to explore. \n\nIf, in the example of America, you were to place you pin on the Oregon/California coast, you ship would sail in that direction until it hits land and you are able to complete your mission. Placement gets easier the more of the land you have revealed.\n\nOnce you have arrived on the coast you can start to explore the coast. This part of the game is split into scenes. When you arrive on the coast you'll have a scene of a beach or a cliff or something. You then have several options, you can either slide the scene left or right (as each scene represents around 50 miles of coastline this would help to complete the coastal exploration portion of the mission), return (in which you would just return home) or explore inland. \n\nExploring inland will cause events to spawn and you will have to react to them (natives approach, a strange fruit, bizzare animals etc). These events are random so you may have to do a bit of poking around before you complete your secondary objectives. \n\nOnce you've completed your missions, or if you've ran out of food, you'll have to return home. Remember travelling home may also factor into your time limit so don't take it too slowly. \n\nDepending on how well you've done in your mission, you'll have a certain amount of gold to spend. You can spend your gold on several things:\n\n* Upgrades to your ship, to make it stronger, faster and carry more loot.\n* Hire new crew.\n* Buy new ships\n* By tools to help with your exploration.\n\nYou can also level up your crew mates, improve their stats in leadership, equip any items you found and don't forget to give your crew shore leave before your next mission otherwise they may be a bit grumpy.\n\nLater on in the game the missions will change asking you to seek out new lands map inland on various islands/continents and even set up colonies for your country. Events inland may change as well. You may come across a French outpost on the New England coast and may decide to destroy it.\n\nThe game would probably end around early nineteenth century. I can also imagine a randomly generated new world mode so things are a bit different each time you play.\n\n"
8cty1h,A game similar to XCOM but using the fallout 3-4 vast system for the turn-based combat + the player is AI in game,"Game System: So the game got the tactical views that are similar to XCOM but all the turns happened at the same time so it is like Fallout's V.A.S.T. but multiple people are using it. Every character has their stats allow them to improvise better. SoThat mean dodging attacks, doing things on their own when your connection with them is cut, chances to disobey your commands, etc. Then there is the social part that is like the mass effect, you can communicate with your main crews, building up relationships, having this Ai, Human friendship/romance if you want. Then you can also affect other's crew's opinion on each other. the entire game doesn't need to be fully voiced, just need some emotional parts needed to have the voice for it to work. The character could fight just like XCOM (or Other Turn-base game) or in vehicles like Japanese anime mech(or western mech, but that would be too close to Battletech). players can make their own AI avatar, and their personality, since a lot of it would be text so there is lot more free space for dialogue. they choose to develop a different kind of personality, become an emotionless AI, a human-hating AI, having a childish view on everything, etc.As you goes through the story y chose your own path(So basically multiple ending ), the classic Sky Net/savior of the humanity/fade into the background of the world, etc. \n\nPlot: So here is an idea that comes up to me when I watch the gameplays for Battletech. The setting can be this future that developed AIs that is similar to the ones that appeared in the ""Red Vs Blue"" show and the ""player"" can be the first successful tactical AI(or an improvement of the previous module) that got made. The scientist couple who makes you, allow you to be(or accidentally make you) sentient. Then they decided to keep you since they put up a ""safeguard"" on your program to make sure you don't go rogue. After doing it, they let you develop your self, letting you customize what you look like. after that, their child a boy and a girl came into their laboratory and sees you. Both of them wants you so but their parent couldn't choose, so they let you choose (the one you didn't chose dies later on). After that, you become their AI friend(AI nanny/butler when they grow up). the couple up you into an eyepiece(the one in Dragon Ball or something similar to it). After sometime later, an (evil) group get the to know couple's research and ransacked the house. When they break in, the sibling was at the same spot, because the one that you have chosen has the eyepiece get to know that something was wrong earlier than the other one, so he/she get to escape and the other one would be captured/killed. This is also where tutorial (at least the basic of it) would be, here would have a message left behind by the couple as an emergency, explain the ability that you have and how would you use it. After you and your ""chosen"" one escape and find help, you two return to a burning house with nowhere about for the rest of the family. Then there is the good old cliche, joining the special force after some year later to find out what happened to them. At there the special force higher-ups see your potential and also the fact that you wouldn't / cannot work properly without your ""chosen one"" so they create a special force around you and your ""chosen one"", there you get to meet the rest of the crew. Just how futuristic the game is set? I'm not sure, it can be Mass effect level or BattleTech level or XCOM level. \n\nThese are the basic.\nSorry for the bad grammer "
8ctf96,90’s cartoon open would.,"I was thinking of a open would adventure game where you play a typical cartoon character for some action cartoon like G.I.-joe or he-man when your released into this town like world and as you walk around the town has a different themes to it depending on where you are, as it could go from a fantasy dungeons and dragons like area to a cute happy colorful area.\n\nThe story I think would be that not a lot of people are watching your show and you need to find a way to make your show more likable but there would be many different main missions that are necessary to complete ( you need to only do 3 then go to a place.) and the others would be side quest. one group might say you need it to be more cute so you would do a bunch of there missions or one group might it needs better music so you would need to help them.\n\nCombat would be a twist as you have multiple themed enemy’s depending on where you are\nAnd different weapons can do different things if\nHas a certain upgrade( like a fire upgrade or a electric upgrade) and your damage would be multiplied depending on your damage upgrade. Speaking of which.\n\nThe main differences to others would be the upgrades aa you can pick a minor thing to upgrade and a mojo thing to upgrade. For example you could put a miner one in health and only get +15 health but if you put a minor one in health you would get double and get +30 health. You could also put it in stuff like speed or damage. \n\nWhat’s your opinion? "
8ct3x2,A space exploration game based on our solar system,"As many games like Star Citizen and Elite Dangerous were showing great advancements in procedural generation of entire planets and systems, the idea of this game is centered on building our solar system based on real information and metrics we already gathered from, its planets, moons and many objects, placed and tracked (like Space Engine is already doing).\n\nI like the sci-fi theme, but IMO its over explored and the approach should be more realistic, with factions and tech, some politics (not so immersive like EVE, but a significant one) and survival, like you needing the right gear and spaceship to enter scorching planets (like venus and mercury) or high pressure gas giants, or drilling on ice homeworlds too far from everything to gather valuable resources (motive of fight). \n\nBuiding and mantaining your operation, with help of members of your faction and AI controlled drones and robots could be one of the objectives, but also transporting, securing the cargo, or helping research.\n\nThe amount of places and settings to be explored is huge, like the Caloris Basin on Mercury, the Valles Marineris and Olympus Mons on Mars, Apollo 11 landing site and Sea of Trinquility on Moon, the Great Red Spot on Jupiter, its moons Io, Europa, the Saturn Rings... There is so many amazing places to explore and set actual ""non procedural"" constructions like the a Federation Base, Mining Corps, Scientific Bases, Military Compounds and so on. The Earth itself could be a flooded place with scarce land, or an eternal nuclear winter, or even been destroied and turned into a ring of dust and debris.\n\nThey sould also base the game on actual distances, with some warpholes distributed among the system, to keep the pace of the game, but also providing a sense of distance and time-arrive at certain places/situations.\n\nThe concept of the first DLC should be a mega wormhole being built somewhere in the edge of our system. Its name: Proxima Centaury."
8csudq,"A Battle Royale game, but instead of the map shrinking, the players get bigger.","Id imagine it like everyone is playing as a human sized monster with human sized guns at the start. Then, as the game goes on, a storm repeatedly rolls in and strikes all the living players with lightning, increasing their size. Eventually, the players would get so large that the whole map becomes like a little arena.\n\nIn addition to the human sized weapons, there would be larger monster sized super weapons too, like a giant rocket launcher or a makeshift shotgun or a Vulcan gattling gun from a jet. Small players wouldn't be able to use the bigger and bigger weapons at first, and vice versa, eventually the players would get too big to use the human sized weaponry.\n\nPlayers would also be able to find mutators, special permanent buffs that change the abilities and appearance of the players (since they're, ya know, monsters).\n\nI think the map would be a City or some semi urban environment so there will be plenty of ways for the growing monsters to size up to the world.\n"

8cofo2,"A trippy 2D platformer in a colorful, fantastical world... except you're just tripping balls.","The game starts whimsical and psychedelic with vibrant backgrounds and blocky pixel art. You gain temporary powerups that change the music (like the super star in classic Mario Bros.) by drinking potions, eating mushrooms and licking frogs.\n\nThe first few levels have lots of powerups, but after they become scarce later, the player character starts coming down and the world slowly starts looking more ""normal"". Instead of colorful pixel art, the world starts looking more photographic and drab.\n\nThen you eat another magic shroom and you're back in wonderland!\n\nThe game is like Super Mario Bros. taken to its cynical extreme.

8co6od,Multiplayer Casino cheating sim,"A game where you scam money from casinos.  It would be a collection of mini-games, as each casino game has different vulnerabilities.  The emphasis would be on cheats that require multiple players working in tight coordination.  \n\nExample activities:\n\n1.  Blackjack:  team card-counting.  There would some in-game tools would help you track high/low cards.  Upgraded equipment could make it more automatic, e.g a high-tech device that lets you walk past a table and ""scan"" the deck to see where the count is.  Don't let the pit boss see you doing it!)\n\n2.  Roulette:  A coordinate minigame, one player can get a preview or some control over the next roll, the other player has to bet and then throw the ball in just the right way for the preview/control to work.  EDIT: If the players are beginners, they can just control/preview the color outcome, which is a modest payout.  As they get more skilled, they can get more precise and hit particular regions, and then specific numbers (better payouts))\n\n3.  Craps:  One person needs to throw some loaded, magnetic dice in craps, and the other player has to pulse a hidden magnet at the right times to make the desired numbers come up.  \n\n4.  Also Blackjack:  One player plays the game while the other completes a mini-game that gives him information about the dealer's hole card, or what the top x cards in the deck are.\n\nAll the betting would be done in standard casino fashion, so as you and your partner gain confidence you can push the stakes higher.  \n\nWith your winnings you can acquire better gear, to help you cheat at higher-stakes (and higher security) tables, and buy new costumes of course. There's obviously a risk/reward angle-- the longer you stay at the table the higher your winnings (there could be some multiplier that kicks in), but the more risk that you'll get dragged into a back room and something unpleasant will happen (like that memorable scene in Casino).\n\nEDIT:  One more idea, for poker.  One player is playing normally, the other is working as the dealer.  The dealer needs to stack the deck to get good cards to the normal player (who then needs to play them well to get a good payout).  The dealer has a secret AR glasses which help him visualize the deck and simplify the deck-stacking.\n\nMORE EDIT: Cheating and winning creates Heat (suspicion from the casino operators).  Players would have the ability to intervene to help avert suspicion from other players.  For example, if player A is about to get in trouble (pit boss is alarmed and heading over with two big scary dudes), player B could use tools to try and stall him.  For instance, a radio hacked into the casino comms, so he could report a false emergency elsewhere to pull the pit boss off.  Or if all else fails, a taser (in which case everyone should run like hell!)"
8cmvq4,"Supper Ball (Attack of the Spaghetti Cans). - Top Down Shooter, about Dodgeballs (The dodgeballs being cans of spaghetti)","So basically, my friend request a idea for a game they wanted to ‘why not?’ Make. So I started to think about Dodgeball, and I was hungry for Spaghetti. So my hungry mind combined those two ideas, me replying with “A game about Dodgeball, but you throw cans of spaghetti”.\n\nAnyway, we got more serious about it, and found that the best way of constructing this, will be a top down shooter (in the same sense of Hotline Miami). You will be able to have a selective choice of characters, but the main mechanic will be a charge for throwing ‘cans’. I had the idea, that the cans can be charged up to knock out the potential foe, bursting open the can, and spilling spaghetti on the floor (which will act as slippery surface). \n\nAnyway, I just wanted to get your guys opinion.

Everything the player needs to do can be automated over time. Like if they start on an island held up by a bunch of giant helium filled balloons, they would need to repair those balloons eventually, so they'd want to automate tape. And once they expand too much, they'd have to change methods of propulsion. Let's say: helicopter blades. They'd need to keep up with the power demands on the motors that spin those, so they'd add more mass in the process.

8ca4x3,"Aight, here's a 3rd person/1st person hybrid idea that implements several types of gameplay mechanics. (inspired by Warframe)","I've started playing Warframe a weeks ago and I was blown up by how unique and just plain crazy that game is. I feel in love, I felt like a child that just discovered the N64, I never like that in a long time.\nBut as about now I'm starting to realize how much more I wanted and how little the game and any game has to offer compared to it.\nI was once a entusiastic gamer, but these days I'm struggling to find any game that would make me feel excited.\nEvery FPS is a copy paste of either CS and COD. unless they try to add wierd elements from mobas like OW. while that game looks innovative, I had a feeling that the victories were more about the hero's abilities rather than the players abilities, and after playing League of Legends (a game, in which the victory is solely decided on champ select) I didn't wanted to give it a chance.\nFortnite also looks very Innovative, but at the end of the day it is just a 3rd person shooter with building mechanics.\nSo.. this is not really an idea, it's more like something I'd want to play, so here it is.\n\nSo the playable character would be exposed in either 3rd person or 1st person based on the object they are controling.\nEach object also has a mechanic type.\nThe character can pasively control a certain object and it's method of exposure would have priority over the other object the character is controlling.\n\nThe controllable objects would fall into a few different categories. So far I got Ranged Weapons, Melee Weapons and Mobility Tools.\nThere are two types of mobility tools, passive control and active control.\nactive control would be vehicles that would allow you to use your primary weapón while you are controlling it\npasive control are the ones that are controlled by you default movement controls and allow you to use your primary weapon at the same time.\n\nSo, let's have an example.\n\nThe character is a space surfer and has 4 Weapon Slots\n\nPrimary: Assault Riffle\nSecondary: Rocket Launcher\nMelee: Light Saber\nMobility Tool: Spaceboard\n\nSo, Imagine you are a standar FPS game. you roll your mouse weel to swap between your primary and secondary weapon.\nThen you encounter some SMG assholes rushing to your face, then you press F. That would trigger a instant melee attack, pulling out your melee weapon, swaping to 3rd person view, while using your melee weapon, the playable character will have a lock on mechanic like Zelda and Dark Soul games, but the combat pace would depend on the weapon. Then you press F again to go back to your primary weapons.\nYou want to move away quickly so you press Tab to use your spaceboard. even tho you are holding an assault riffle, the spaceboard has priority so you use your character in 3rd person.\n\nThis game has no sprint button, and every ability is dependant on the objects the character is controlled.\nIf the character is baredhanged, it would be sprinting by default (you want find guns fast if you're in a war and you don't have how to defend yourself, don't you).\nthe default set for the character would be in 3rd person.\n\n\nObjects:\nJetpack: an object that would have a toggle mechanic.\nwhen inactive, it will have no effect on the character view. it will give the character an ability to quickly thrust away in the mouse direction.\nwhen activated, the character will be viewed in 3rd person and will fly. you can use your primary weapons while flying.\n\nso far this is what I got in my vision.\n\nnow let's jump to the campaign\n\nit will consist on several types of mission.\ninvasion, defense, destroy objective\nbut there is one that it'd be unique to this game.\nthis type of mission consist on rushing through a linear in a racing fashion.\nI don't wanna say sonic the hedgehog, but it just to give an idea.\nit begins with the character on the starting point. and activates its spacesurf (name is WIP) to rush to the objective. it has to pass through a lot of obstacles and enemies.\n\nnow let me get something clear about the mobility tools objects.\nsome objects would be wereable and others.. like cars would not.\nand the character can have more than one mobility tool at a time\nlet's say the character has a jetpack, and spacesurfer and... running shoes (and a pokedex).\nthey will give the character pasive abilites.. but they will be activatable. (Holding TAB and selecting on a wheel hub)\n\nso the stages for these kind of missions should include wild roads and sometimes scripted 2d scenes where the focus is not controlling your character movements but to shoot enemies from the sides\n\naight my head is aching already so let's skip to the multiplayer\n\nI got one main idea. it's a dominion type game mode.\nthe players need to control certan areas, and there will be supplies drops on the map outside these objective areas. (so there are objectives everywhere and you miss on a rocket launcher drop if you camp let's say Sector B)\n\nthis is pretty pretty raw btw.\nif somebody wants to make this game, and wants my help to make my dream game it'll be awesome. but if not.. well that's ok i guess.. i hope somebody reads this and makes it so i can play it one day."

I also don't think it could be monetised because of legal reasons and to make sure the creators of Dark Souls don't notice it nobody dare translate it into Japanese!"
8c7qep,Medieval BR Game,"I had the idea in my dream after going through this subreddit yesterday.\n\nYou can find meele weapons like swords, daggers and spears. You can also find range weapons like slingshot, bow and crossbow.\n\nEvery  2\-5 minutes a 1\-2 books send by the gods will drop which gives you the ability to cast spells.\n\nYou have base skills to heal up to 90 health\n\nYou can find Armor which gives you additional HP per part. up to a max. HP of 150.\n\nYou can find horses to travel fast\(but be careful, if you get hit while riding you take addiotional fall dmg of 15\). \n\nBut you can attack while on riding with spear, bow, crossbow and longsword.\n\nIt would be good to be able to carry a meele weapon, a range weapon and a spell. only 1 of each, to balance.\n\nMy details maybe your inspiration?:\n\n**Weapons:**\n\n Slingshot\(30dmg\), Bow\(55dmg\), crossbow\(80dmg\), Longsword\(40dmg\), double dagger\(25dmg\), spear\(35dmg\), axe\(60dmg\).\n\nBooks to find which gives you the ability to cast spells, each book has 3\-5 charges, after that, the book is destroyed.\n\n**Tier 1:**\n\nLightning spell\(stun target for 3 seconds\)\n\nFire spell \(deals dmg over time, up to 60, 5 per second\)\n\n**Tier 2:**\n\nIce spell \(slows all actions of the target by 80&amp;#37; for 4 seconds\)\n\nroots spell\(impairs movement of the target, but the target can still block, fight, heal\)\n\nTier 3: rather weak, but situational pretty strong.\n\nfor example: you transorm your target into a bunny, for 5 seconds or until he takes dmg. \(headshots are unavaible when transformed\).\n\nBlast spell: Knockback all Target in front of you and deal 20dmg each.\n\n**Zone:**\n\nIts a dark mist, which is slower than your movement speed, but deadly.\n\nyou can see about 10m inside the mist, you cant see into it from outside.\n\nIt deals more dmg the longer you stay inside. Endzone should deal about 20dmg per sec. at start.\n\n**Combat:**\n\nI would also recommend having the ability to roll and block. \(not with all weapons\)\n\nBut it gives more depth to the combat system and most players like being fast and agile.\n\n**Map:**\n\nmany different small locations, like a tavern/inn, stalls, village, castle, tribe village, festival, dungeon, cave etc.\n\nMost of them are connected to each other with trails.\n\nThe map could have green plains, forest, swamp, hills, river, lake or a canyon.\n\nI've read that it isnt ""allowed"" to ask for money, but if it would be a moderate hit and you got all your expenditures back, i do deserve to be payed from the profit.\n\nthats just fair, right? \n\nIf you're going to develop this game, please stay in contact with me, \n\ni do have some experience in marketing and a little in coding \(i understand how code works, but couldnt get into coding myself\) and would love to help you out wherever i can.\n\nAnyway, statisticaly it will never be developed, so feel free to just state your opinion about the idea and maybe add something you would like to see or something thats missing in your opinion."
8c4zne,I had this vision/idea in a dream...,"The player is a spy/ 'woke up with no memory' or something, in a desolate Korean city with tall, dilapidated residential towers and crumbling infrastructure. The player has quests to complete/ something to uncover, in the partially open world, dark dilapidated city. \nEvery night, a gang plagues the lonely city, robbing/murdering/injuring the few inhabitants of the city. The players job is to explore the town, uncover its mystery, etc during the day.\nHere's the part my dream emphasized on:\nTo stay safe at night, the player camps in one of the scores of abandoned apartments in the city, to defend themself from the bad guys. Staying in one apartment flat for too long increases the chances of getting located, so they must constantly change their safehouse as they explore parts of the city. There can be a huge horror aspect for this too. If this gains more momentum, I'll post more of it."
8c421j,"My minecraft stylized clicker game concept. I have lost some motivation from making it, but thought I'd share still.",
8c0b8s,A horror game in which the monster is just standing there. Menacingly.,"In most horror games, the terror comes from not knowing when you'll run into the big bad monster(s). But in this one, the monsters are plainly visible, and the real terror comes from not knowing when they are going to aggro.\n\nThis concept is the [gibdo in Ocarina of Time](https://www.piranhazone.com/images/zelda/ocarina/p64/en033_1.jpg) fleshed out into a full horror game.\n\n*What* aggros the monster(s) is made purposefully obtuse, so the player can never tell if they'll be safe the next time they have to sneak past.\n\nThe concept is flexible enough to vary the setpieces throughout a whole game. Maybe it starts off as one monster in the middle of a room you have to constantly travel through. Another time the game forces you to sneak past it while carrying something loud trying to not bump into obstacles. Later, you return to the room *and it's not there!* Where did it go? Shit, now it's in a tight hallway!\n\nLater in the game, there's forty of them lined up in rows [like stone soldiers](https://pmdvod.nationalgeographic.com/NG_Video/989/515/56733_1_1280x720_640x360_177576003886.jpg) and you know at least one of them is real.\n\n##### BONUS IDEA\n\nNormally I'd save this idea for a future post... but it fits the above idea so well that I have to put it here:\n\nNormally you can outrun the monster easily. But if the monster is in your field of view when it aggros, it forces you to look at it. The camera snaps and locks on the monster as its body contorts and shuffles toward you. Since you can't run backwards, you're forced to *walk* back, and it's slowly gaining on you. Even worse, since you can't see behind you, you'll have to navigate by memory so you don't get stuck or snagged on the map. After a while, the camera unlocks and you can run proper."
8bzx73,Brothers in Arms Online,"I thought of this in response to a post about using extra CPUs to increase the amount of players in an online match.  The redditor thought it would enhance online games by increasing  the intensity of battle and offer some easier enemies to fight.\n\nIn case you don’t know about Brothers in Arms, the game is a squad based strategy FPS. The player has control of 1-3 squads of 3 people each that are NPCs. The player can give commands like move to a certain cover or suppress an enemy unit. The goal is ultimately to suppress a enemy unit enough to flank them with an assault squad and catch them in the open. It is extremely difficult to run head first into enemies and be successful. Using your squad for suppression and moving with cover is necessary to flank around an enemy and overcome them. The original two titles in this series had a PvP split screen mode similar to what I’m explaining that was really fun. \n\nOnto the idea. Basically mixing Brother in Arms’ style of gameplay with a Conquest style online game. Brothers in Arms was a WWII based series which worked well with the Gameplay mechanics, so I would hope it would be set in WWII. Players would spawn with squads of NPCs at their command at a Team base. Players would move their unit, with Vehicles or on foot, to key points in the Battlefield. Players would fight using their squads strategically to assault or defend an area. During the fight, if you lose squad members, you will be down that person until your whole Unit is wiped out and you respawn with a fully revived Unit at a Team Base. If the player himself is killed, he will automatically switch to the next in command in the unit. You would be grouped with other Players in a “platoon” (sorry if I’m not familiar with Military ranks) That you can work together with over a mic. The playing area would need to be large but I don’t think larger than current Battlefield size maps. Vehicles and Artillery could be manned by Players but would require a certain amount of Squad members to run depending on the vehicle. Also I think it would be fun if Artillery squads could be attacked and taken out by opposing teams to stop a barrage on an area. You know the idea, take control points and hold them to win the game. \n\nAlong with a progress system for better weapons and gear for your player, there could be a system for your squads to upgrade. Perhaps with a Fire and Assault squad to start but work up to MG, Bazooka, grenadier, mortar etc.  You could upgrade each squad type by a rank that will improve there battle effectiveness. It would also need balance in squads being used. For example, bazooka squads are extremely effective against Tanks, but are less mobile and can be easily flanked by a enemy Assault squad. This would require Players to back up more powerful squads with a Fire squad to protect their Unit. \n\nUltimately I’m a super fan of BIA, played all the titles from the original Xbox, and know there are other super fans like me hoping another BIA would come out. I think this would be an awesome way to take the game into the new gen with a refreshing take on multiplayer online games. "

8bv9im,"Ready Player One ""Oasis"" styled game","Ok so this is obviously quite a difficult fantasy idea - not my own as such but hear me out.\n\nThe theory is very similar to the Oasis in the book/film Ready Player One.\nYou have a MMORPG in which you can do anything you want. Now lets get realistic...\nThis would have to be compatible with PC / Console and/or VR. Obviously VR players would have a much better experience and control, as well as a lot of expensive equipment. So shouldn't be a necessity.\n\nYou have a base game platform / framework. This is the free portion that has a very basic online hub where players can gather. Would also have to track stats / inventory for every player. Blockchain recommended to stop cheaters/hackers giving themselves stuff. Blocks solved by players in the hub or whilst not in the game, in return for in-game credits. Basic crytocurrency / blockchain theory there.\n\nGame developers could develop MMO games which are small sub-sections of this online world - yes, kinda like the book/film. Obviously the basic portion of this game would have to be free to allow players to hop in and out of games with their friends but games companies could sell VIP access to certain parts or additional content as microtransactions (kind of like they do now). But these would be on a global marketplace and each item would have to be coded to have specific properties / follow certain laws, as they should be able to be used in other games - imagine having a sniper rifle from the Halo series in a driving game for example. Yet again, pretty much Ready Player One, but I'm trying to think of how to make this a realistic idea. \n\nFor that to happen, certain player stats like health, armor, magic points etc also need to be cross compatible between games. Also games could have separate leaderboards and there could be a global leaderboard for all games.\n\nAlso game development access would be limited to actual game developers to keep it good. There could be an indie section for other people looking to make smaller games etc.\n\nPlayers would also be rated on personality, more for the sake of trying to stop scamming etc.\n\nDying would not make you lose everything, but similar to Player Ready One you would lose in-game currency to the point where you can't buy necessities like ammo. Yes that means you would have to buy EVERYTHING.\n\nGame developers could have challenge schemes in place to earn extra in-game currency. In-game currency could also be acquired by other players who have limited access to the platform's SDK to create non-game-affecting in-game content such as clothing or avatar styles or emotes/animations.\n\nThis would obviously not be a game itself, but a generic cross-compatible game platform. Like I said, it's obviously a fantasy idea but not impossible to do. But would take time to develop and do well. But if done well and other game developers take to the idea, this could be the start of the next big thing, which could probably even conquer games like Fortnite.\n\nAnyways, I know it's a pretty generic idea, and I don't mean to take credit from Ready Player One - clearly that's what 99.999% of this is based on, but I've just watched it and feel inspired about the possibility of such a thing if people come together to start developing it.\n\nLet me know your thoughts.\n\n \nEDIT: More thoughts - all games should preferably include a spectator area in it where you can hop in it and watch the action unfold. Maybe make the maps a bit more open so players can climb on rooftops and/or spectators could run onto a racetrack if they wanted to. "
8btklf,African Wildlife Football (Blitz the League + Bloody Roar) AWF,"The most deadliest animals are in Africa and football is a gladiator sport. 12 teams that face each other for the African Gold (championship). 8 on 8 tournament and whenever a players momentum is high enough, he will get into beast form and devour someone whom they may have injured or whomever is hurt ( ie: a quarterback turns into a rhino and gores anyone in its path for a touchdown). Each team will have their own territory. Imagine watching the Lions vs. Rhinos in a huge Coliseum. That Coliseum will be named Battleground (Super Bowl for the NFL). I would love to see this as a movie, but would rather for it to be a video game first. (btw the Hyenas can be a ALL WOMEN TEAM but so ruthless and not the average group of women.)\n"
8br7ez,Alternate History Simulator,"A simulation of a time period in human history (or maybe the entirety of human history if technologically possible) where the player can change specific things, like make Japan not bomb Pearl Harbour or make it so Karl Marx was never born. You would change what you want to change and then let the simulation run and see what crazy stuff happens. \n\nOf course, creating a detailed simulation of any period of history is impossible given the current technology, and creating an accurate one is on a whole different level, but would it be possible to create a program similar to this with today's technology, albeit extremely simplified and far less detailed?"

8bodn9,I want an open world King Of The Hill action adventure game set in fictional Arlen Texas.,"GRAND THEFT ARLEN\nThinking of it like The Simpsons Hit and Run, but with Propane themed missions and missions from previous episodes, Tom Stricklands car as an unlockable vehicle, Boomhaurs Ferrari, Dales extermination van and unlockable playable characters along with a story about Peggy being kidnapped or something and that's why Hank has to track down her kidnappers and along the way needs the help of his friends or another story mystery wise. Side missions for different characters throughout Arlen, and collectible Propane Monthly Magazines. DLC about Dales conspiracies with aliens coming true and Bill having to serve in the Army not as a barber but as a soldier. Could involve guns for hire such as Dale, Hanks father Cotton, and so on. Multiplayer aspect could be about Cotton running a gun smuggling business that leads to you battling other players to make the most money. Customizable houses and lawns, ragdoll physics upon death, Ladybird as a companion and a mechanic to make her attack. Weapons could include all the guns from Cottons business as well as propane themed skins and propane accessories. More ideas anyone? It's 2:30 AM, I need more! Feed into my fictional fantasies that will never come true."
8bnkzz,A dating sim but with family,"Random idea I had, spawning for my love of the 'found family' trope. Instead of someone looking for a date, the main character's an orphan who desperately wants a family. So the goal is to interact with the various NPCs and befriend them until they take you in. Bring them gifts, choose the right dialogue options, pass skill checks, all to impress them. No romance, just lonely people becoming less lonely. \n\nCharacter ideas so far:\n\nGrizzled warrior looking for an apprentice. Journey with him, learn to be a warrior, call him dad until he relents. \n\nPre-teen fellow orphan who's dog ran away. Go on a quest to find it and if you succeed get a sister and a dog, two birds with one stone.\n\nThe local orphanage is running out of money and might have to shut down, help the Orphanmaster get some cash and bond with the orphans, impress him and you get to pick an orphan to take home. 100 percent completion and he leaves you the whole orphanage because he's old and sick, you are now a single parent of ten, congrats.\n\nKitten shows up, do odd jobs to get money for cat food, it now loves you forever.\n\nThoughts?"

8bmkx5,An evolution themed RTS - Aliens/Parasites/Swarms,"**Information on Gameplay:**\n-\n\n**Inspiration and Reference Images**: \n\n(**Parasyte**: https://i.imgur.com/09q4gxW.png , https://i.imgur.com/Kv4KFVp.png)\n\n(**Starcraft 2 - Heart of the swarm**: https://i.imgur.com/WfsGRGf.png , https://i.imgur.com/0nxx7wH.png , https://i.imgur.com/udF9U7T.png , https://i.imgur.com/YswHog8.png) \n\n(**Grey goo**: https://i.imgur.com/f4HJ84I.png)\n\n(**Spore**: https://i.imgur.com/xzG65cd.png , https://i.imgur.com/59ntLWK.png , https://i.imgur.com/eqEfMph.png)\n\nI'm thinking **third person perspective** with **top down birds eye mode** for late game ***swarm control***. - I'll touch back on  this later.\n\nYou play as an alien parasite that's taken over a human thirsting to *grow*.\nTo do that you must feed on lifeforms (humans, animals, other infested, natural energies(?)).\n\nIt would start off being relatively calm but you get more and more ill and hungry, after awhile you start to secrete fluid that [balloons up enveloping the human(or other animal) in a cocoon](https://i.imgur.com/IoEaUJQ.png). This is where you pick a starting ability or trait. For movement speed, attack speed, feeding speed, etc.\nYou also design your race with basic traits [similar to spore](https://i.imgur.com/xzG65cd.png). \n\nIt would start with only you but multiply quickly until you have about 5 minions. You feed and fight other aliens and human resistance evolving through a tech tree until you hit the end where it would turn into an RTS. Lifeforms for feeding would become scarce quickly and other alien races could reach the rts mode before you but that would make it easier for you to come in and feed on them if you weren't far behind to catch up.\n\nYou progress evolving after so much experience is gained, after so many iterations and improvements you merge into a [hive-like structure](https://i.imgur.com/f9Yrq3R.png). \n\n**RTS *Swarm Control* Mode** then begins and you are zoomed out to a top down birds eye. Your minions take on your final evolved form and you now also harvest energy from the earth and are able to put out minions quicker. You are able to evolve you race again at this point. The objective to to take over the world. You can creating monsters that swim, fly, are large or small, and strengthen them with abilities (ie. poisonous, explosive, acidic, or piercing attacks to fight with) or enhancements (hardened armor[nullifies normal attacks/weakens piercing and explosive], advanced carapace[immunity to acid, weak to piercing]), etc. \n\nThe goal is to give the player freedom over their race design, but have the gameplay rely on that, positioning of limbs, spines/claws, natural armor should all have a heavy affect the future of your race. You may find your opponent has a more efficient design, you can study them and try to recreate yourself, or if you manage to kill one maybe steal it and potentially some of its abilities, doing that should be risky and require your main character leaving the hive to do so.\n\n---\n**Background on Player:** \n-\n\nYou play as an infected human(or animal), a virus(you) has caused the world to fall into complete chaos. \n\nParasites have fallen from space and infecting lifeforms. They control the human but have an adaptive ability causing them to rapidly morph *evolving* very quickly, it takes some experience to morph(combat would improve fighting abilities, taking damage for health and armor, dangerous world conditions could also play a role in evolution.\n\nThis is an extensive concept and requires some jumping around to grasp, but I thought it up on the toilet and felt pretty proud of it. \n\nI'm missing some parts I would like to iterate on and simplify, but I'll leave it until later to touch up."
8efyxm,"A game that encouraged players to form arbitrary heirarchies among themselves, but it's not enforced by the game so they can betray, etc.","I've been thinking for a while about what factors would make players want to make agreed-upon alliances with each other, without being forced to by the game. The alliances wouldn't be an actual mechanic, like in MMO's with ""guilds"", but rather they would consist of arbitrary agreements by the players such as ""I'll protect you if you give me food"", while the game's mechanics would be made to encourage that behavior. Even in said MMOs and in team FPS games, there is 0 teamwork amongst players. Basically, I want Machiavellian politics incorporated into a game.

8ecwg7,A first person base builder,"If there's a game similar to this idea please let me know.\n\nI liked the idea of the settlement system in fallout 4 but i thought it had a strange predicament. It was too in depth and involved to it to be an extra feature in the game but it was pretty simple to be its own game. (I understand not everyone liked it but it didn't fit well with what people wanted out of fallout)\n\nI'm a fan of base building games but they eventually get to a point where the game gets way too easy. So i thought of a game where you can start a camp of a handful of people and eventually build multiple towns and develop trade routes. However waves of enemies (zombies monsters goblins whatever) attack at random points and in random sizes. \n\nThere could also be weather effects like fires, earthquakes, storms, snow, floods that can affect towns, spread sickness etc. \n\nHaving an end goal to work towards while also being bombarded with harsh conditions which requires creating defences and upkeep of towns and supplies. \n\nAlso working with your survivors to defend and scavenging to eventually assigning citizens to jobs like engineers, shopkeepers and scientists.\n\nEssentially my ideal game would be mashing the top down city builders with a 3rd/1st person rpg."
8ecets,A fighting game in which the special moves are performed by stringing normal attacks.,"A long *long* time ago, I was working on [this little tech demo.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mROHGTlkdpQ&amp;t=17s) One of its defining features was that, to do special attacks, you strung together the correct sequence of 3 (or more) normal attacks.\n\nFor example: neutral punch -&gt; back kick -&gt; uppercut would make you throw a fireball (instead of the uppercut at the end).\n\nIt was partially inspired by Avatar (the animated series), wherein elemental powers are tied to the fighting moves. To me, their fighting styles were almost like a dance to summon their powers.\n\nOnce started testing this in my little demo, performing special moves felt really good. It also added a layer of predictability and mind games to your actions. Since you could recognize the start of a special attack, you can prepare for it. And since the opponent can make you expect a certain move, they can switch it up on you at the last second.\n\nThere are even more powerful specials performed by even more complicated strings. Some could be screen-filling attacks... in which the opponent's best course of action is to *go in hard* to interrupt the player before he completes it.\n"

8e6okw,mobile boss fighting game.,I love breath of the wild and I really loved fighting the lynels. They were challenging and rewarding to beat. I think it would be fun to make a mobile version of the same fighting style against a large boss like one. \n\nWith a mobile game gyro controls can be taken advantage of. I'm thinking gyro for the aiming if there's archery in it and maybe little gestures like flicking the phone to do a backflip. The game would need a lot of these gesture controls as I think touch screen controls just feel terrible if you try to emulate a gamepad too much.

8e49gr,Ereb Online - An Idea for a open world chivalrous sandbox game !,"Ereb Online\n\nIntroduction\n\nAn Isometric MMORPG/SANDBOX taking place on a fictional Continent named Ereb set in a semi-realistic/fantasy setting with dragons and magic. The dominant race on the continent are humans who fight among themselves for power and glory, however this constant bloodshed has turned them blind to the real enemy , Naamah the Undying. an undead Demigod who was defeated centuries ago has returned and is raising his army litteraly from the ground slowly invading the world of Ereb. Despite the imminent threat the Houses(guilds) of Ereb still fight amongst themselves for riches and land. The players will be able to create their own characters , venture into the land exploring, fighting, joining guilds and immerse themselves into heavy pvp content and pve content alike.\n\nThe Graphic/Art style\n\nIn order to allow the game a long lifespan the graphics should be done in a PIXARish style. Similar to wildstar and Crowfall , yet still leaning abit to the more realistic way. Maybe a comic look like in the comics from Brian Wood : ""Northlanders"", or games like Albion Online, Crowfall. Reference : https://www.crowfall.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Ranger_Female_Render.jpg , http://www.strefammo.pl/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/albion-expeditions.jpg An isometric view should be done mostly because of the budget reasons. MMOS these days cost alot and yet offer very little or alot but made with poor quality, instead of throwing a big part of money out the window for the graphical fidelity, Ereb online would look alot like Albion Online https://forum-attachments-turbo.strats.co/original/2X/2/2994bb441b3c8a7de29c3e22e7b2daa28d546469.png\n\nAnimations\n\nFor me it is one of the most important aspects of any game. Good animations tend to make the gameplay that much more satisfying. In Ereb online Animations should look a bit overexaggerated and silly so it feels more lively\n\nCombat\n\nA typical Point'n'click combat with active and passive skills. the skills should base on the weapon or armor you have equipped similar to other recent games like Guild wars 2 or Albion Online. All skills should be skillshots , so in order to do dmg you have to actually hit the target. The game should also take huge inspirations from Battlerite.\n\nStory\n\nThere is no story or story quests in the game, no voice acting or cutscenes. Many MMOS these days give huge budget chunks in order to develop ,usually, a poorly written story with very bad looking cutscenes and mostly text written quests which 90% ( numbers pulled out of my ass but I'm farely sure this is very close to being accurate ) of people skip anyways. Story is not that important in MMOS a branching story should be left for Solo experiences like Witcher 3 or Kingdom come. MMOS can have a Lore , let the players alone create their stories.\n\nBeginning of the game\n1.1 Character creation\n\nThe player chooses one of 3 races : Northerners - A tough people who live in the North of the Continent. They are tall and fair haired with bright colored eyes. Middlingers - a Group of people sharing similar features and similar beliefs and culture. They livei n the middle of the kingdom. ( Medieval britain, germany and in the South Italy ) Southerners - Brown and darkskinned people living in the south similar to medieval arabs. Choice is purely cosmetic , however some of the skin tones, beards, hair, tattoos and scars will be exclusive to one folk. After that players will be able to create their own characters. Each folk has a different set of Hairs, skin tone, faces, beards and tattoos and scars. There will also be an age slider which will make every hair color turn more gray and gray and add wrinkles. This is to add believability to the game. The choice of the folk comes also with a starting location. Northerners start in the North , Middlingers in the Central part of the Continent and the Southerners on the Desert of Ereb. The player will also be able to choose their name, but there will be an additional option to randomize the name accordingly to the chosen kingdom which will give +25% exp in everything for ever , this is to encourage players to have lore friendly names\n\n1.2 Choosing Archetype\n\nThere are 3 Archetypes to choose from , and they only affect your starting stats which are Strength/Agility/Intelligence The Strong + to Str The nimble + to Ag The wise + to Int\n\n1.3 Starting the Adventure\n\nThe player spawns in the point which he picked earlier and after a short tutorial can start to do various activities , gaining experience, garhering materials, crafting, exploring, socializing and more. It is up to the player what he wants to do next.\n\nOpen World mechanics\n2.1 Leveling hubs\n\nAfter their first login every player will start in a town or village. Those places will be small fortifications which will act as hubs. Every city/town will have a main square with shops, crafting stations, stables and other things. The terrain outside cities always will be farmlands or town outskirts which will feature mobs from lvl 0-5 ,foxes, giant rats and so on. beyond the farmlands there will be grasslands or other not significant terrain where creatures will be up to lvl 15. These Zones will feature smaller hubs with higher level spawns, like for example cemeteries with undead, ruins with ghosts , forests with wolves, bears, caves with giant spiders and so on. For example: You start in a city surrounded by grasslands and farmlands where you kill lvl 1-5 foxes, giant rats, big toads ( the typical fantasy bestiary ) but in the nearby forest roam lvl 5-15 wolves and bears, and in that forest is a cave where 15-20 spiders or undead or whatever lurk. This creates many potential hubs for players and no map is ever dead as every lvl area is close by so high lvl players run together with low lvl players. https://imgur.com/FSWFgkb\n\n2.2 Pvp Zones\n\nThe world of Ereb is divided into 4 pvp zones. -Green pvp zone – is a pvp free zone, players cant be attacked or killed by another player, however they can die and lose their EQ/Money/exp when killed by a mob (Not sure about this one) and other players can steal it. -Orange pvp zone – is a restricted pvp zone, Only house members can kill other house members. Normal players can be killed however the ""murderer"" will gain negative reputation and killing a player with a high negative reputation will give other players alot XP and also sends the killed player to a jail where he has to mine ore for a specified amount of time.\n-Red pvp zone – Is an unrestricted pvp zone, everybody can kill anyone, however someone killing others will gain bad reputation and will need to remain in the red pvp zone till the negative reputation lowers in order to not be thrown into jail. Killing such a player still gives a lot of experience. -Black pvp zone – the lands of Naamah are very dangerous and aren't controlled by any faction. Undead roam the lands and have a lot of loot and gold on them however there are no restrictions on pvp and killing a fellow players doesnt give bad reputation. https://imgur.com/wIwecZR\n\n2.3 The Lands of Naamah\n\nThe lands settled in the black pvp zone are the lands of the undead king Naamah. The land is roamed by his minions and the deeper a player goes in to the zone the more dangerous the foes are but also the greater chances are to find rare loot. In the lands of naamah mobs drop legendary items which are procedurally generated items with a unique look and name and also better stats that give the player a motivation to traverse those dangerous lands. The lands of naamah have also random bosses which guarantee a legendary item however beating them is hard and players have to work together in order to get their reward. ( the game has no sharing so the drop gets always only one player besides gold which every player gets in an equal amount ) [ The concept is similar to the dark zones in the Division ]\n\n2.4 Questing\n\nThose mentioned already ""Lvling Hubs"" will feature various ""activities"" instead of quests. Everything a player does in a city and in the area outside the cities will give the player XP and Reputation. Of course for helping NPCS in distress ,like a villager attacked by giant rats, or crops being infested with giant bugs, players will be rewarded with gold. Reputation however will be a system which every player will slowly gain for helping out in a city or around and in return will get acces to cheaper services and mounts which will be unique for every major region. For example players will be able to buy camels in some regions in the desert for a high enough reputation. In short everything you will do in a region will give you reputation/XP/Gold.\n\n2.5 Contracts\n\nPlayers will be able to create their own quests for other players, these will be called contracts. A contract is an agreement between two players on a task and reward. The player giving the contract gives a task and gives also a reward , the second player can agree, bargain or decline the contract. For example : Player A needs to deliver some goods to his house region in the south, however he gathered the materials a few regions away. He wants to get fast to his House Region back. He knows he would have to travel through a heavy pvp area. He decides to create a contract for an escort. The task is to escort him through the territory. He sets a starting point and a finishing point. Player B accepts the task as he is content with the reward of X gold for his time. He manages to escort without any incident and upon getting to the point on the map he gets his reward which is automatically taken form Player A. examples of contracts : -Escort -Gathering contract ( gathering a specific amount ) -Mercenary job ( Skirmishes or taking part in a war on a side of a House ) -Crafting contracts -Transport Contracts etc.\n\n2.6 Dynamic Events\n\nSimilar to gw2(Guild Wars 2) , Ereb will feature dynamic events, Escorting merchants to another city, putting out fires in a field, defending a city from monsters. However those events wont be as highlighted as those in gw2 and wont have a branching out short story. Dynamic events will just happen and will be ongoing ( houses to which the region belongs to also get more income and deplet the revolt meter by doing those events – more on this in guild section) for example : A small town is overrun by goblins and because of few players failing to defend it the goblins take the city for themselves ( or ransack which shortens the whole chains of event by one event which is liberating the city ) , the town wont be free untill players choose to liberate it. They have to fight the goblins in order to free the city it wont be free after a few min , it will be persistent. When the players free the city, two new events will start. #1 repair the city and help people #2 chase the goblins and destroy their camp. If the players wont help to repair the city it will be weaker the next time it is under attack and if the players wont destroy the goblin encampement they will quickly overrun the city again. an example for a smaller event : Crops are burning , and the farmers need help to put the fire out. The event wont be highlighted on the minimap , the farmers will shout for help and the fires should be clearly seen as a threat , the players will have to defeat fire elementals and also grab buckets with water and put the fire out in order to stop the crops from burning out. If the players manage to put it out the farmers will be relieved and will give the players some gold if the players wont be able to help the farmers the burnt plantation will be overrun with fire elementals and if the players manage to wipe all the fire elementals out, the farmers will be able to go back to work and again reward the players.\n\n2.7 Bosses and Dungeons\n\nThere will be two types of Bosses in the open world Passive : Those will be roaming the open world randomly but accordingly to the biome wich they inhabitate. Those bosses will be massive have special attacks and will require more than 5 players to beat. At defeat they will drop valuable materials wich every player will be able to obtain. Aggressive : Those monsters will lurk in caves, dungeons, deep in forests and to get to them players will have to group up and go through a mini dungeon ( tunnel path ) to get to them killing minions guarding the boss on the way. After killing the boss players will be able to loot the stash which the boss gathered ( for example dead bodies hanging from the ceiling killed by a giant spider or a gold hoard stashed away by a greedy dragon ) Bosses should be unique and have each special mechanics and be difficult to defeat. Players shouldnt be able to defeat a boss just by zerging. Instead of having long instances, dungeons should be in the open world. Those dungeons should be labirynths with alot of paths and bosses. They shouldnt be done to be done daily but as often as someone likes. Players should be able to farm dungeons even without doing the bosses. The dungeons should be long and get more difficult the deeper someone gets. So players can solo the first levels of the dungeon. ( similar dungeons can be found in Albion Online ) https://imgur.com/HRiLSlC\n\n2.8 Gateways\n\nFrom time to time in the world Portal will appear leading to small instances. The Portals will show up on a minimap and to open it players will have to kill a small boss spawning next to it. After entering the portal players will find themselves in a small dungeon filled with demons, in order to get out of the dungeon players will have to defeat the last boss and gather all the loot ( a small portal will open itself when the boss is defeated ) or upon death. Inside those Gateways full PVP will be allowed so other players can fight against each other in order to get to the final boss and get the loot.\n\n2.9 Death Penalties\n\nEvery player upon dying looses all loot he has in his bag excluding everything he has equipped and gold. The player respawns in the nearest town or village and has a chance to gather their lost equipment. If the player was killed by a mob he has a specific time period to gather his loot in which no one else can pick it up. However if killed by a player in a pvp zone then the enemy can take it right away . A killed player goes into a downed state from which he can be revived by a friendly player with a specific skill , at that time a player can choose to respawn immediatly or choose to wait for the revive.\n\n2.10 Gathering\n\nThe open world will have resources which players will be able to gather, wood, herbs, ore, leather. The gathering system will be different than in other games because the nodes will be much more common and denser however, How common the nodes are will depened on the location. For example : Wood will only be gatherable in forests, and the higher tier the rarer it will be. Ore will only be gatherable in mountains and caves. leather will be everywhere however you will have to kill animals to get them , and passive animals like boars and deer will run away from players pretty soon, so hunters will have to track their prey and approach carefull ( Special mechanic for hunting ) Herbs will be everywhere and every herb will have a different effect. In order to gather a large amount of these ( besides herbs ) the player will need to use a pack animal ( Donkey or Ox ) and crafting equipment such as pickaxe, axe, sickle and skinning knife. Players will have a chance of gathering better qualities of materials. The chance will be higher the higher the lvl in the particular skill like , mining, hunting etc. Materials will be divided into tiers and to create a higher tier armor or weapon , crafters will need a higher tier materials. The higher the tier the rarer the material is.\n\n2.11 Crafting\n\nPlayers will be able to craft items and sell them. Everything a player can buy and find ( excluding boss drops like legendary weaponry or legendary armor pieces those only can be found and sold ) will be craftable and sellable , no soulbound/accountbound system. Crafting will happen at crafting stations and be a bit more tedious than in other games. For example : In order to craft a sword , a smith will need to melt metal into bars, then heat them up in a forge, next go to the anvil to create a form, put into a bucket of water to cool and lastly sharpen them. Crafting will have several jobs which people will be able to do : Bowyer,Weaponsmith,Artificier,Tailor, Leatherer, Armorer, Alchemist, Enchanter ( enchants weapons and armor ) etc. Also depending on the quality of the materials the product will be that much better. In order to craft players will need a specific recipe , to get a recipe they will need to either find a random loot drop or ( not sure yet) buy from an NPC. Some recipes will require a higher lvl of a crafting skill.\nBy Crafting players also will increase their statistics like Str/ag/int. For example : A player decides to be a miner and by using a pickaxe and gathering a large amount of ore players STR grows and also skill MINING.\n\n2.12 Towns and Castles\n\nTowns - will be the main places to trade , buy, sell and enjoy a bit of socializing.. Every town will have a Arena , Tavern , Stud farm, crafting stations, Storage house, Auction House, a Place of cult. for example : Arena – a place where players will be able to fight against themselves in a bracket to try and win the prize, bidding on fighting players will be also possible. Tavern – A place to buy food ( gives bonuses to stats ) or log out safely to get a bonus upon relogging after a couple of hours ( bonus to xp gain ) Stud farm – to buy mounts Crafting stations – allows to craft for a small fee. Storage house – Players will be able to store their stuff for a small fee , every storage house is unique and items stored in storage house A wont be found in storage house B , those will have to be transported. Auction House – Place to buy and sell items from players for players. A place of cult – temple, chapel , place of power a place where players will be able to marry other players and also gain their nobility status ( guild master ) The majority of towns will be found in the three kingdoms, only few towns will be found in the pvp regions ( excluding the black zone where no towns will be found ) and those will give the most income to the house to which the region will belong to. Villages- will be similar to towns however they wont always have all the services available, only some and will be very frequent found across the map ( excluding the black zone ). Also villages will be possible to skirmish and be under the influence of dynamic events like attacks or plagues etc. Players will be able to build player houses in the village ( the amount will be limited ) and players will have to pay taxes for the owned land. House Castles - in every region there will be a place for Houses to build castles. Around those built castles players will be able to built their homes ( the amount will be limited ). To build a castle the Owner of the guild will have to choose a castle from the castle list and choose the spot to build it. After the guild master chooses the castle and the place players will have to gather a specific amount of materials to build it. Every player in the Guild will be able to help build the castle. Upon completion Castles act as hubs for guild members, they cant be entered by other players , they increase the income in the region , slower down the revolt meter and also raise the base presence in the region level ( more on this in the GvG section). Depending on the tier of the castles , castles will have crafting stations ,storage rooms and bedrooms for safe logging out.\n\n2.13 Food\n\nPlayers can buy food in taverns , each type of food gives a specific bonus for a specific amount of time. These are great alternatives for elixirs, however food gives less bonus and for a shorter amount of time than elixirs(made be Alchemy).\n\n2.14 Fast Travel\n\nThe World of Ereb will have almost no fast travel, the only way to transport goods is by road using a mount. The heavier the goods the slower your mount gets which makes the risk traveling the roads higher, of course there will be shortcuts but those regions will be open pvp and though the traveling will be faster the risk will be also higher to loose all the transported goods. However there will be also another alternative. Players will be able to take ferrys which will transport a player for a fee ( depending on the amount of goods transported and distance ) to a chosen port. This will allow players to travel fast but will be also very expensive.\n\n2.15 Mounts\n\nEreb will feature Mounts which will be solely for traveling or Transporting. Horses will be faster but also won't be able to carry as much as oxes. To buy mounts a player will need to visit a stud farm and spend a high amount of gold in order to have a mount. A mount will loose its speed bonus overtime, in order to replenish it players will need to buy food for the mounts. Riding a mount also gives experience in the RIDING SKILL.\n\nCharacter Progression\n3.1 Stats &amp; skills\n\nThe main stats as already mentioned are Strength , Agility and Inteligence. Strength is damage and maximum HP + the ability to weild bigger weapons and heavier armor Agility is a more universal stat which defines the crit chance and accuracy with melee weapon, ranged weapons and spells Inteligence defines the magic damage of your spells and maximum mana + the ability to use mightier spells Players gain all those stats as they are using weapons or amors or skills which are str,ag,int based. Players will have also a variety of passive skills to slowly lvl up, swords, hammers, axes, bows, crossbows,spears,shields,greatswords,pyromancy,geomancy,hydromancy,necromancy,heavy armors, light armors , crafting skills etc. Each of those skills will be gained as long as the player uses the item which is connected with the passive skill. With lvling up each skill , various active skills are gained. Similar to TES:O or Ultima Online. For example : if you are a mage and use fire spells you gain lvls in Pyromancy To avoid situations where people after a lot of farming and playing can have everything maxed there should be introduced a system where if you start using magic , whereas you were using primarily strength, your strength slowly reduces as your inteligence raises so the weapon dmg becomes much lower as your magic dmg becomes slowly higher. For example: You start as a human who wants to be a warrior, you grab a sword and light armor, and slowly gain 2 of 3 main stats, strength , a little less agility and 0 intelligence, after awhile you are able to wear heavy armor and a big great sword but you want to play as a mage now, you pick up a staff, learn a few spells and cast them, as your intelligence raises your strength lowers, to the point where you are not able to wear heavy armor anymore but cast much more powerfull spells.\n\n3.2 Armor &amp; weapons\n\nIn different mmos armor stats besides defence have also other statistics, like str, wis etc. and get more powerfull with each lvl. In Ereb Online Armors should only have Defence stat and restrictions, the better the defence the more restrictions. Also a 1st lvl armor shouldnt be 100x worse then a high lvl armor, they should be similar. Additional things which could define Armor or Weapons coud be enchantments which would give some special bonuses or passive/active skills and Quality of the armor or weapon made.\n\nPvP and GvG\n4.1 Guilds\n\nGuilds (Houses) should play a huge part in the game and players should be only able to join one and with leaving serve a timeout penalty before being able to join another. Joining a guild shouldnt be mandatory but also offer alot of new gameplay opportunities. House - To create a Guild(House) a player has to buy a nobility title for himself which costs alot but also gives a few bonuses. After getting the nobility status a player can name their House ( Brywere, Ylstearn etc. ) and similar to the name generator there will be also a house name generator which will also give a big bonus to xp/income/resources etc if the player choose a generated name for their houses ( again this is to avoid silly names like The Dank Squad, or The FluffyBunniesGuild etc, and add a more gritty and serious feeling to the game). The player will be also able to create a House Banner. After that a House will be able to ( for a big amount of money ) claim land and build a castle and a village. Those will be hard to capture and will give steady income and a place to call their own by the house members. Upon joining a guild a players armor/clothing/cloaks/shields and so on automatically change color and symbols to the guild symbols, very similar to Albion Online.They also will be forced to pay tax to the guild depending on the value set by the guild leader.\n\nRevolt meter – A house controlling a region ( which will be shown on a map ) will gather taxes from villages around however the % of the income will depend on the revolt meter. The lower the revolt meter the higher the income. In order to deplet the revolt meter players from a house need to take part in dynamic events in the region and defend villages and outposts from enemy houses. When the revolt meter hits the maximum lvl the House gets no income.\n\n4.2 GvG\n\nGuilds, called later on Houses , can fight for territories which are upon conquering taxated by the Ruling House. In order to attack a territory a House needs to send a war message to the House they want to attack, the House leaders settle on a date, and on that date and hour the attacking House and Defending House automaticaly go into pvp mode against each other. To win a Territory the attacking house has to have a bigger presence in the region then the Defending one. To gain Presence, the Attacking guild has to capture points of interest ( villages, Fortifications, Holy grounds and so on ) And the Defending guild has to Defend those positions. After a timer the house with the bigger presence in the region wins the war and claims the land while the other retreats and cant attack for a period of time. Guild which are in constant war can also do skirmishes, which are attacks on the enemy guild territories to pillage villages and fortifications which gives loot.\n\n4.3 PvP Arena\n\nEvery Major City will have an Arena where players can enter and fight against each other, from time to time big tournaments will happen in those Arenas to win major prizes. Players will be able to bet on other players\n\n4.4 PvP Duels\n\nPlayers will be able to due. In order to do so , players will have to request a duel on a nearbly player which will put them in a duel state. A circle will appear which will show the place where the duel takes place. Players will be also able to place bets for in-game currency.\n\nEnd words\n\nThis is is a quick summary of my ideas I had for an MMORPG that could be done with todays technology with a rather average budget (according to this site: http://www.yourgameideaistoobig.com/ it would be around 8mln$) and 30+ Team. This game could work and some systems have already worked in a few other games ( Huge inspiration : Albion Online ). Some numbers ( skills, perks, armor ,weapon stats and so on and so forth ) or Ideas need alot of tweaking/balancing etc. however I have no time nor willinges to do them as such a game most likely will never be created. I did this in my own free time , mostly because I'm bored and frustrated with the current states of mmos. It saddens me that games didn't go into the direction of Ultima online but chose to be more casual and theme parky instead of immersive and sandboxy. Also please keep in mind English isn't my first language and I am a poor writer even in my own mother tongue which could make some passages confusing. I tried my best to write them as clearly as possible for you to understand my thought process however knowing my past record it is most likely some things will be to some of you confusing. Of course I am open to any suggestions, critique etc. However I'm pretty much fond with how it turned out and I think I only could be persuaded to add few things but not change anything."
8e0b0z,Car Mechanic Simulator + Forza Horizon,"Basic idea is:  \n\n- (potentially open-world) racing game \n- The act of building/creating your car would be much more in-depth than other racing games offer\n- Sourcing/choosing parts, building the vehicle, and testing would be single-player\n- Racing and other events (potentially drifting, car shows/meets, media events, etc.) could be multi-player (could be done with ""drivatars"" or actual matchmaking)\n\nGame could start with a cutscene: \n\nCongrats! You've just (inherited/bought/stumbled upon) this Garage!  You must now (find/purchase/choose) a vehicle platform, basic components, and preferred events types. As you succeed, you'll earn (sponsors, merchandising opportunities, and/or fans, as well as ) credits by competing in and winning events!\n\n---\n\nThis is something I thought of while watching a GTA:O race, just after coming from a Hoonigan binge\n"
8dve8l,"I need level/mission ideas for my game. (Top down shooter, I linked a screenshot)","Screenshot: https://i.imgur.com/2HYPcVK.png\n\nThe combat is pretty much ready. Each weapon is useful. A flamethrower is better against swarms, a shotgun is better against tough enemies that are close to you. A pistol or a moderately accurate machine gun is good for whatever is far away.\n\nOne enemy (the green one, not seen in the screenshot) eats the orange ones until he explodes. I'm open to weird monster ideas if you have any.\n\nNow the most important, I don't have ideas for how to do the levels. The simplest thing is to just have waves of enemies and there will a gamemode for that too. For levels, I'm not sure how to make this fun.\n\n_ALL_ ideas are welcome. Go wild."
8dsbpw,no clue on this yet :/,"my idea i had is kind of a messy idea, and it's still a work in progress. my idea is you play a assassin ninja, in between missions you can walk around and talk to npcs, duel other people in pvp, upgrade weapons/ poison's, ect. then if you want to take on a mission, you contact your trusted npc helper ninja friend that gives u a option to pick from 3 missions, easy, medium, and hard ranking on star level. hmm then while your in game you get put trough random generated maps, with random patrolling guards, and random target spawns. pretty much your mission is to go trough the map and kill your target in any way possible, you can stealthily kill them with poison, or sneak up and cut there head off with a sword, or ninja stars( this still needs more work in the idea development)... you can go in stealthy or just loud and hack and slash away but if u hack and slash then the target gets aware of it and sends more and more men after you, the more you kill and closer you get the target gets frightent and your npc friend tells you the target is trying to run away, which becomes a race against time... if target escapes you lose the mission, but still gain some exp and maybe some money for your efforts but not as much as you would get for killing the target. and after you kill the target or do it loudly you have to get to a extraction zone, to leave the mission area. for the gameplay part i think a combination from over watch genji jumping and wall running and stuff, and maybe a hint of dark souls/ nioh combat systems, with a little of for honor in like directional blocking and stuff but it's a work in progress and just my idea, i'd like to hear some opinions on how it could be better and maybe some changes? :)"
8drihy,Hp lovecraft inspired jrpg,In this game you would be on a small town on a small island and you sick and tired of it and want to leave. The only problem is that there is a giant sea monsters blocking you path. \nYour main weapon would be you spear gun but you could find upgrades in armor or by them from shops to increase your speed or damage.\nIt would be liner as you explore the abandoned ships and decks for loot to upgrade you damage and help you take down the monsters.\n There would also be puzzles for you to solve for you to get to secret areas and to open chests. \nSound fun?
8dr900,[Dream] I wish there was a Stargate SG-1 game like this,"So I've had this idea floating around in my head for quite some time, I love the Stargate SG-1 series, and there are quite a few ways now to make a true to life game loosely based off of the series, and I have a few ideas that would be quite interesting. Of course this will never happen and every game based on the license is killed, but ill give it a shot.\n\nThe game world can be procedurally generated, with new ""maps"" being made every time you dial into a new planet. But have story based maps hand made with lots of alien complexes and areas to explore to find alien loot to bring back home. Start off with the original enemies, then add in new ones with DLC such as the Ori or an Atlantis upgrade. \n\nBase building and outposts can be built, sort of like Ark on the planets that are suitable for habitation, building outposts can then serve as command posts, opening up larger parts of the galaxy map to explore, bring in resources, etc. \n\nThe Cheyenne Mountain complex can be a fine tuned custom base alot like Xcom, where you can upgrade and build rooms in the mountain, upgrade tech and outfit SG teams to explore planets.\n\nHave a very in depth strategy layer of the game, build alliances, recruit alien teams, they can provide special gear/weapons/planets depending on who you form alliances with. \n\nThere can be raid like mini games where there will be meters for each faction, if you piss them off too much they will try to assault your outposts, or eventually Cheyenne Mountain and you have to defend it.\n\nEnd game content will involve planning out elaborate raids and heists against the system lords and trying to take down each one\n\nThe faction system will work for all factions, so say you dial up a planet, and it generates Jaffa and Replicators they will fight among themslves and you can choose to either help one faction, kill them all for loot, or let them fight among themselves and take whats left after a battle. Eventually, if they are at war with each other, one faction may give you a mission to help them fight the other, or they may both team up and fight you at once. \n\nThe more fame your team gets, you may get special recruits who want to join your team, such a special ops agents, alien bounty hunters, or even a Tokra. Each ""class"" could have special perks when out on a mission. \n\nSo thats my idea, I dont really expect anything like this to  ever happen, just wanted to inspire some fans out there and get it off my chest. Thanks for listening. "
8dpr9r,I'd like to share a game concept (still unfinished).,"##SeelenHeil: Divine Spirit Of Malevolence (prevailing name) (PC/PS4)\n\nis an psychological horror sandbox-type action-adventure game. \n\nYou are thrown into the roll of Uqbahr, an violent assassin who acts in a terror group called Al-Nasrallah. \nYou will  seek, collect, drive, ride, fight, waver, obliterate, fly, linger, murder, rape, breed, and escape in a surreal fantasy land called ""Erd' Uter"" who resembles parts of Dubai, Qatar and Basra.\nShown in a pseudo-3D and top-down perspektive using vertically scrolling at some points.\n\nIn this shady and shiny world of ambiguity, acquire as Uqbahr superhuman godlike abilities and annihilate great Erd' Uter \nwith all buildings and all creatures. \nMake an end to everything. \nReign as a almighty over the chaos you created, until self resolution ... or replace yourself gradually:\nrescue you from this godlike abilities to do no more harm on Erd' Uter and the creatures. \nTry instead to stay away from your abilities, or even try to peel them of ... And also bear the deleterious consequences for your choices.\n\n#Gameplay:\nThe basic idea is to set the fury from the player free in majestetic movements, so the player can feel like a devilish god,... but also, annoy the player with two choices,\nto create a clear psychedelic and philosophic game experience.\n\n\n+First:\nHelp Uqbahr to be moral and reduce more suffering, created trough his powers and immoral personage. \nBut to do so, you can't use his supernatural powers and can't do harm to others. \nYou have to stay away from using powers and harming others, to come to a low destruction scale, that will help Uqbahr, \nbut will be heavy to handle.\n\n\n+Secondly: You attempt to destroy everything using Uqbahrs super powers. \nYou will get killed from atomicbombs, when your drestroyings are to heavy and the humans can't fix them anymore. \nWorld gets full destroyed; End of game.\n\n\nFirst has more to do with parkour; running; swimming; riding on animals (just when they have a high healt and you don't have abuse them before!); driving cars - subways - carriages; let you carry in cars - subways - carriages - on animals (just when humans and animals like you/ you are nice to them); holding (thight on persons, animals (they can support/ hug you/persons can give you clothes/vegetables and you can do that to) cars, buildings with your arms (to help persons)); \nrape/killing persons and animals with oil/knifes/guns/cars/bycicles etc., destroying/ burning houses from inside and out with your hands (or using a car). \n \nSecondly has more to do with flying (really high/out of the world); glide; hanging (on street lamps with your poison tail); climping (up on buildings and from them to another); holding (tight on persons, animals, cars, buildings with your poison arm); tear off ( - clothes, skin, and outer facade from buidlings, with your littel blade hand); moving (trough the underground from fields, city like a mole/ worm).\n\n+What you can destroy/damage/rape/tear into peaces is mostly dependent on the enviroment. \nIn his home town, fields and in the city, you can rape and tear into peaces; animals/ women/children/ men - and damage/ destroy buildings, streets, lights, cars, subways, bycicles, carriages, floors, soil (deep underground), trees, shrubs etc. with or without his powers and guns (just when nothing is in sight then you can't destroy it or you just can destroy the ground you stand on, when using his powers).\n\n+You are getting killt by a destruction scale of 12% and 100%. On 12% due to the strong hallucinations, the deformed growth of the body parts and the persons and animals who fear you. \nOn 100% due the government who attacks you, the people who fear you. \n(On the beginning Uqbahr is by 50%)\n\n\n+You can lower the healt and sympathy-scale of animals and humans (by harming them) or increace (don't harming them/ give them items they need like food etc.). The lower it is the more they hate and fear you.\n\n\n+The KI humans and animals in the game remember who hat abused them- theyr animals- beloved ones/who destroyed the city - buildings, which leads to negative medial, police and military attention. And also to stronger attacks against you, where you go. \nSome humans and animals can follow you to take revenge. \n\n\n+The KI can fix most of your damage in the city, but it takes his time, what is due to the seriousness of the damage.\n\n\n+Depending on the course of the game, Uqbahr leaves more traces, who can have also an bad impact on him, \nwhile resulting in police and military investigations. \nHe leaves for example:  damage (psychic too) and defilements, such as; \nscratches, firebrand, dirty clothes, clothing scraps, skin scraps ('cause of mutation), his poison tail, blade hand, urin, saliva, blood, food, foot marks, blue spots, and traumas. (and more).\n\n#Ugbahr's Powers: -----? \nStill in development.\nBut clear is, that the player have a full controllable poison taile on his botty and are also able to control the wind\nand so the fog or aura, that surround Uqbahr.\nIn the fog or aura can be clothing scraps, stones, and whatever the enviroment gives to the player - also, when the player often\nuses Uqbahr's powers: humans / animals, cars and small buildings.\n\n#Art design: ----? \nMust be fixed. So, still in development.\n\n#But here are significant influences who participated in the idea development and should contribute to the future game atmosphere:\nIkaruga (game//gameplay and artwork), \nTransistor (game//gameplay and artwork), \n[Prototype] (game series//gameplay), \nInFamous (game series//gameplay),\nSilent Hill (game series//artwork and music): \nZahhak (Iranian mythology), \nLes Chants de Maldoror (poetic novel), \nLes Fleurs du mal (poetry), La Jeune Parque (poem)...: \nSome paintings from Hilarie Lambert, Maarten van Heemskerck, Orazio Grevenbroeck, Sir David Wilkie... \nand horror artists: \nSculpturs from Louise Nevelson: \nMusic, architecture and landscapes in Dubai, Qatar and Basra: \nAbrahamic religions: \nLookism (the discriminatory treatment because of unattractive looks):\nDahlia's Tear (dark ambiente music project//music). \n\n\n#PS: I apologize for all spelling mistakes and grammatical errors. Also, for misinterpretations that may will come from my choice of words. Usually I don't write in english."
8doyqy,A turn-based combat system that's ALL about positioning.,"### How It Works\n\nPlayers take turns moving their units (characters in an RPG, units in a TBS or pieces/cards in a tabletop game) in a play field. Each unit has its own stat for life points and attack power, along with a unique *area of attack* and movement pattern. For example, some can only attack in a short radius around them while others can only attack in diagonals like a bishop in chess. Some can only move one space at a time, while some can only jump by several tiles.\n\nHere's the key:\n\nIf your units' areas of attack overlap on top of an enemy unit *and* their combined attack power is equal to or more than the enemy's life points, they eliminate the unit. Units never attack to lower an opponent's HP; nobody takes damage in the traditional sense. **It's all or nothing.**\n\n### Why It Works\n\nAlthough this would be fun and unique in a video game, the idea is more suited to a tabletop game. Too many tabletop games, including both CCGs and collectible-miniatures strategy games, rely heavily of having to keep track of health points. Players have to bring pebbles, pennies or calculators to keep track of health pools.\n\nBut with this system, players wouldn't need to keep track of anything. It is streamlined play.\n\nFor video games, some RPGs (like Chrono Trigger, Megaman EXE and South Park: TFBW) already approach the concept. In this case, the strategy focuses purely on maneuvering and trapping enemies. In the grand scheme, that's what strategy games are all about anyway."
8do0ty,Thrift store themed rpg,In this game you would play a new worker at a thrift store. But when you enter the back room it’s like a new would of magic and card board. You are then sent on a quest to “stop the evil curse by defeating the the dragon or something” as it’s put in the game. It would be like Zelda as it’s a top down adventure. Every town is made of cardboard and the weapons and armor is all crappy cloths and broken furniture. You could also find pieces to upgrade certain equipment to give you more health or speed. Like if you had a chest piece of cardboard you would need neat looking stone and ripped cloth to upgrade and gives you more health. \n\nThat’s all I got you like it?
8dkbpw,Anything,
8dk474,A jet set radio meets Hot line Miami sort of game,"In this game your sick and tired of the rich jerks and strict police that you decide to start a revolt. It would be a top down game with a open world with characters to talk to and places to explore. Each mission would have a time limit and involve you “fighten da system” as you say. Like in one you would have to wreck a neighborhood full of rich pricks, in another you would trash the sighs of a greedy mayor. As you walk around the town police would try to attack you and you can fight back but the more missions you do the more cops spawn.\n\nWhy do you think, it sounded fun to me"
8djyh3,A game where it’s your job to help people and clear aliens for places,"You play one of 5 characters hired to go from town to town clearing aliens from places like hospitals and theaters. It would be top down shooter as you can clear the places in any order as there is a hub town for each level. When your in a town you can also talk to the people there and depending on who you are some characters will act different. Like if you where talking to someone who likes movies and your also a movie nerd you would get along but if your playing as a business man you would not have much in common. Any way you would have 5 towns to clear out and each would have different themes and characters. Like one would be and rust belt sort of places and one might be one know for its entertainment. In the 6 level you get to the mother ship with all its weird tech and neon lights where you fight the final boss, a giant alien.\n\nGot any suggestions?"
8djsrl,Heist game idea,"Highly inspired by ""La Casa De Papel' large multiplayer game. There are 3 roles 15 criminals,50 hostages,40 Police units. So everyone will have different objectives for the criminals it would vary from guarding a specific group of hostages, areas and making sure the hostages are working I also forgot to mention that the main goal for the criminals is to print as much money as you can in the bank before any criminals get hurt. The criminals will, of course, have the ability to kill the hostages but their team would lose money.The hostages will also have specific objectives and if every or most hostages complete them they escape because each objective will be a part of a plan to escape. If any of the SWAT enters in the bank too early like the first 3 days (yes there would be a night and day cycle) if the swat also don't stick to the plan and with there team and to the commanders orders they lose money and xp and if this type of trolling happens a lot they will be paired with the low class roleplayers. There will be a negotiator and SWAT team commanders they give out an order with an options screen and they will vary from SWAT team alpha enter there delta go there etc the SWAT commander can only send in the SWAT team when they have the NEGOTIATORS order and the NEGOTIATORS goal is to get the hijackers to release hostages from the main exit in exchange for time for the next negotiation the negotiation option screen appears on the Hijackers leader screen and they settle on an agreement like 1 hostage for an extra 4 hours, The hijackers escape from a tunnel which they all can go through any time they all have to go through in order for them to all escape if they go to early they dont get a lot of money if the hijackers get away no one except them gets money if the negotiator sends in the SWAT team the police get low money the criminals can also fight back and head towards the exit. Im sure I missed a lot of things so please ask me questions"
8diziv,Action game where the injury is 'almost' permanent.,"I replayed Tomb Raider 2013 through Definitive Edition, and I always thought the game would've been infinitely better if it had actual survival system we saw from Metal Gear Solid 3: a fully fledged hunting mechanic, an actual exploration that demands a challenge, a stamina meter that can be filled by eating foods, a surgery system etc instead of pretending to be a survival action game.\n\n\n\nAnd one of the scene from that was Lara getting impaled, which, at first, was a hugely important plot point, hamfisting the theme ""this game is about SURVIVAL Y'all"". A half hour later, it gets completely forgotten after the opening by making Lara Croft female Rambo. But a few hours later, the game suddenly pulls that plot point again and shows the cauterization scene without a proper context building for it, almost as if the game's saying ""oh, yeah, this was the 'survival' game."" And the game's back to normal again.\n\n\n\nI didn't notice this in the first playthrough, but knowing the complete story now, that got me so off guard this time. It made me realize that I've never played a game where the injury is permanent.\n\n\n\nThe bullet wound is a serious injury that takes years to fully recover. Even a bullet stuck in your leg can kill you by blood loss. But in pretty much all shooters, maybe except for mil-sims like Arma (which you still return to normal after each campaign mission), the injury means nothing. You get shot, you wait for a few seconds or take a first aid kit and then you're fine. It was the accepted gameplay contrivance since the medium's inception.\n\n\n\nWhat if that isn't the case? What if the damage you take is a long-term disadvantage in a shooter? Not necessarily long as a real life, but long and lethal enough to make you avoid a gunfight.\n\n\n\nLet's take aforementioned Tomb Raider just as an example. You just got shot from the enemy, and you get a red HUD indicating that you are hurt. Let's say that indication stays, not going away. That red HUD remains until you reach a campfire point. At the campfire you have to treat your wound in a similar manner we saw in the cauterization cutscene in MGS3's cure menu style. You stopped the bleeding, but your max health point is now smaller like Demon's Souls until next day in the game time.\n\n\n\nObviously, there should be a drastic balancing for this to work like the enemy rarely having an automatic rifle or a huge change in enemy accuracy and health. But I think it would be interesting if we see a system like this implemented in a stealth game, RPG or a tactical game."
8dhjz9,For my Shopper: The Mall Run it would be cool if I could have some voice actors and actresses to voice the Security Guards yelling,"Instead of a police radio during the security pursuits you can get yourself into in the mall, you would instead be greeted the whole time with security guards yelling at you such as:\n\n“Get back here punk!”\n“You’re going to be trespassed!”\n“You are trespassing!”\n“There is no way I am wasting my time on you!”\n“I am not wasting time here!”\n“(Taunting) Trespassed!”\n“Hey! Stop that kid!\n“Stop that cart!”\n“Stop that scooter!”\n“Get back here!”\n“Hey Punk!”\n“Damnit we lost him.”\n“Where are you!”\n“Sir, please cut that out!”\n“You better cut that out!”\n“We lost him!”\n“You have to find that guy!”\n“You will stay on that guy!”\n“Sir don’t ride your shopping cart in the mall!”\n“Call 911 NOW!”\n“Get out of here!”\n“You’re busted!”\n“We need a SWAT Cart NOW!”\n“We need that roadblock!”\n“We need to stop this guy! Send all guards here now!”\n“We need all guards here!”\n“Follow that guy! I don’t care what you do, JUST DO IT!”\n“What does his guy think he is?”\n“We lost sight of him!”\n“We need to find him!”\n“(Sarcastic) Yoohooo!!! Where are youuuu?”\n“(Sarcastic) Hellooo? Anyone here? My tummy is hurting!”\n“(Totally Sarcastic) Don’t worry. Slow down. I won’t bite. We won’t KICK YOU OUT!”\n“Sir Get off the scooter!”\n“We need a roadblock now!\n“We’re now at level 2”\n“We’re now at level 3”\n“Attention we are now at level 4”\n“Level 5! We are now at level 5!”\n“Level 6! We are now at level 6!!!!”\n“You are so busted.”\n“The entrance! Get out of here!”\n“We need a drone out here NOW!”\n“Do anything you can to stop this guy!”\n“I’ll take care of the kid!”\n“I’ll take care of this!”\n“I will take care of this guy!”\n“This guy is going to jail!”"
8dfqev,What is the Marvel Universe Online?,"(caveats: it's too big, too expensive, don't own the licenses, and Square Enix is probably already doing a watered down version for the Avengers Project)\n\nWhat is the Marvel Universe Online? In 1979 the movie Superman made the world believe a man could fly. It made the comic book character feel alive, real for the first time. In 1998, a video game called City of Heroes made the world believe they could all fly, leap tall buildings, or run faster than a speeding bullet. It's was a game that for the first time let us be the Paragons of justice that we only read about in comics. The Marvel Universe Online hopes to put that sense of wonder back in the hands on everyone who had a taste of the life of a superhero.\n\nWhy Marvel? Marvel was built on the idea of the everyday man or woman becoming greater than they ever thought possible. No perfect alien savior's, no Amazon goddesses, no billionaire vigilantes, just ordinary people becoming the extraordinary. Sure, Marvel has those things, but at its core, it's the common man's struggling to fight the good fight against the forces of evil. Whether bitten by a radioactive insect, exposed to cosmic rays, or just discover you were born different, it's still you. The Marvel Universe Online asks the question, ""What do you do now?""\n\nThere are efforts underway to create a ""spiritual successor"" to City of Heroes. They are making great strides, with limited resources and I wish them all the best, they are truly doing good work, but I'm affraid they are building their games through the eyes of 2008, the year CoH was sunsetted. This industry advances exponentially every year and I fear their game will only appeal to the nostalgic. The Marvel Universe Online will be a game with an eye to the future, using the most advanced gaming engine and development technologies that builds a world that feels real and gameplay that feels natural. To call the Marvel Universe Online an MMO, is to only see a fraction of its potential.\n\nWhat can it be? At its core, the Marvel Universe Online is a superhero or super villian simulator. A persistent universe with NPC that have independent routines that are altered by the existence and interactions of the players. Mugging, robberies, shooting, are all happening and the NPC heroes that we are all familiar with maintain a tenuous balance, but when the players tip the scales, everything changes and things begin to escalate. As your character builds a reputation in the world, you will have the option to create an actual Marvel comic based on your exploits. There will even be an online repository of all the greatest heroes and villians in the world to for an ""Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Online"" that is published every year. Features like custom action figures or wall art are just some of the ways to not only make the player feel like a part of the world, but are a good source of revenue.\n\nThe devil is in the details. Pie in the sky ideas don't make a game, knowing what it takes and making the right moves does. This is why it's important to get honest opinions, professional advice, even if that advice is to quit. The details will never really solidify into a solid pitch without input from as many sources as possible and even then there is no guarantee of success. There are no dillusions about the odds of Marvel even taking notice, but something this great is worth the effort. So, what is the Marvel Universe Online? If you've even loved comic books, it will be the greatest experience you've ever played.\n\nwww.themarveluniverseonline.com\n\n"
8deovc,My ideal dialogue system,"It's a pretty simple concept. So simple in fact, I'm surprised I have yet to encounter it in any game I've played. \n\nYou have standard dialogue options. Things that would pop up in any bodies head when playing and under it you a search bar/ somewhere where you enter text. By entering a keyword in, you may unlock another dialogue option. Example: You enter an inn and you talk to the innkeeper. You get these options:  \n1)I'd like a room   \n2)I'd like a drink.  \n3)I'd like some food.  \n4)Any bounties lately?  \n5)Nevermind.  \n\nLet's say you pick option four. If you type in ""Mage"" you get to ask him about bounties on mages. If you type in ""red haired"" or ""redhead"" or ""red head"" he cam tell you about wanted gingers, maybe you are looking for somebody with that description, or you just wanna bust a red haired criminal. \n\nAnyway, here's the cool part. If you look  closely at the innkeepers model, particularly his right shoulder, you will notice a tattoo peaking out. You can type in ""tattoo"" to uncover the ""May I ask you about that tattoo of yours?"". \n\nHe tells you it's a matching one he got with his wife. Only you recognize it. If you type in ""Firejaw"" you uncover the ""it's the Firejaws' Bandit group brand"". He unveils you just entered a Firejaws' ambush and they rush in from the front door and you fight them or run. Now if you had actually slept in the inn or eaten the food you would've been sold in the salve market, but through this system you had a way out. Now the optimal solution would've been to leave the place and mark it on your map. Then go to the town guards, type in ""map in the dialogue box then type in ""Firejaws'"" on it. Afterwards the guard gives you options on what they're doing. \n\n1)Raiding\n\n2)Camp\n\n3)Kidnapping\n\nAnd so on. But you can type in ""fake inn"" or "" ambush"" or ""tattoo"" to get the option ""they're pretending to run an inn for good knows what"". And so the town militia sets out and you will get your reward for your tip. \n\nAs you can see a dialogue system like this will insure that the players doesn't get options that he doesn't even notice, or be limited by a perception check for things he actually perceived. Thoughts?"
8dbxwm,bullet hell but you can only type to kill,"Gameplay: basically typing of the dead, you would have to type random letters to kill enemy’s and stop projectiles. There would be basically 5 levels but the game is like the binding of issac or enter the Gungeon as there are tons of things for you to dodge and you can move around. Boss fights are just one really long sets of letters.\n\nWhat do you think?"
8das69,Story based game ideas? Night in the woods game.,I wanted to make a game where it focused on a story and that you could interact with people and change the story. Got any ideas? 
8d9k07,My video game idea Shopper: The Mall Run,"Shopper: The Mall Run (video game)\n\n\n\n\nGenre: Racing, Open-World\nRelease Date: TBA\n\n\n\nShopper: The Mall Run is a racing video game and is the second in the Shopper racing game series.\n\n\nGameplay:\n\nThe gameplay involves the player playing as Leon driving either a shopping cart or scooter depending on the player’s choice of vehicle, around an extremely large shopping mall called Sondia Bay Shopping Mall located on the East Coast. With the most people and the largest mall in the USA with the largest crime rate and the most aggressive security.\n\nYou can go back and fourth between the mall and roam around and your safe house at Leon’s college dorm when you go up to the end of the parking lot of the mall to leave or to Leon’s car parked in the parking lot.\n\nThere are 2 types of vehicles that Leon can drive, you can either drive a shopping cart, or a kick scooter. You can customize the weight, Speed, handling to make it go faster unlike all the other racing games, this is about how light your cart or scooter is rather than speed, and even the visual appearance of your vehicle.\n\nIt’s not a matter of how fast you are since Leon can run very fast forever and never gets tired or run out of stamina or die from overexertion at all in the game no matter how fast you go on what you do when racing, it’s a matter of how much weight and stance and overall tuning of your shopping cart or scooter is so it goes faster.\n\nWhen you buy a cart or scooter, there will be different types of them with different visual appearances and brand names of every sort.\n\nThere’s spoilers, wheels, vinyls, logos, headlights, (for when it’s nighttime when the mall is closed) tire smoke, neons, LEDs, and even brake power for harder events. Headlights come with the cart and scooter for every scenario and you don’t need to buy them, since Leon uses his phone flashlight.\n\nThere is a 24-hour day and night cycle when you look outside and when the mall is lit or dim-litted depending on the type of day, and races, some parts of the storyline, and security pursuits still continue even when the mall is closed at night and some lights may be out at night so it makes it harder unless you upgrade your scooter with headlights.\n\nThere are no pedestrians except Security guards at night but tons in the day. Nothing really changes that much besides very little lights being on and most of the place being lighted by the light of the moon and night sky with occasional spotlights and some lights being on, and you can enter any store you want and some lights will still be on at night. Some lights might be turned on for the sake of seeing better during races and pursuits depending on the event. (Story mode events and normal races)\n\nYou can ride your shopping cart or kick scooter up and down on the escalators and stairs. They just go up straight like ramps. So they are easy to go up and down and they don’t slow you down whatsoever but you need to go in the right direction of the escalator of the direction you’re going up or down. Going up will always be on the right and going down will always be on the left on the lower floors, and on the upper flowers vice versa, but there are no restrictions on that on the stairs.\n\nElevators will instantly open up when you click on the start button when you are near them, and you can quickly enter and they’ll go up and open back up on the upper floor extremely fast. Often times you can use them to loose sight of the security guards. Security guards can’t enter the elevators but pedestrians obviously can along with you.\n\nWhen you’re at Sondia Bay Shopping Mall, the main setting of the game, it’s a really big and open mall that’s really large with multiple sectors and areas and even different malls inside the mall which even more to area than just the place being a single mall. \n\nYou can ride around crazily and the pedestrians will always dodge out of the way no matter how you approach them or how fast you’re going just like Midnight Club and The Crew. The pedestrians are only there for decoration and realistic effect and aren’t really a hazard, and they are only there for dramatic effect in the Crowd Battles, and the only real hazard in those races is wrecking your cart or scooter since it’s easy to wreck. You can also jump on ramps and benches to tricks as well as a scooter.\n\nYou can jump off of escalators and stairs to do tricks like flips and overturns. You can also jumps on random ramps and all and there’s no limitations on where you land. Jumping off of a ramp and landing onto the ground on a lower floor will cause you to be reset back onto the floor you were originally on with a fade-in transition.\n\nThere are 9 boroughs of the ridiculously large mall to the point where there is actually 6 different malls inside Sondia Bay Shopping Mall all connected to each other. Sondia Bay Shopping Mall basically a mall with a bunch of malls inside it. \n\nSondia Bay Shopping Mall is 8,000,000 square feet including the parking lot and the parking garage.\n\nEach separate mall has 30 stores in each separate mall and there are so many separate sectors inside it.\n\nSunnyvibe Mall\nFancyville Mall\nEastside Mall\nWest Mall\nDepartment Mall\nSondia Bay Approach Mall\nParking Garage\nParking Lot\nSondia Bay Central Mall\n\n\n\nInfractions are actions that cause a security guard Pursuit:\n\nHitting a security guard\nPutting a fake barcode in front of a store burglar shoplifter alarm\nHitting the front door of the security guard official headquarters office\n\n\nInfractions:\n\n\nRunning into displays\nDestroying property\nRamming Roadblocks\nRamming Security Guards\n\n\nSecurity Pursuit Mode:\n\nIn security Pursuit mode you are now wanted by the security guards of the mall and you have to outrun them in order to escape.\n\nYou can knock over displays to stop them or throw water you find in water bottles near the water fountain. You can also find hiding spots when you’re not within a certain radius of them such as the bathroom, the inside of a really big store, the fitting rooms of a store.\n\nThere is a 6 star Wanted Level at the top of the screen that indicates how much you are in trouble by the security guards. There are 6 phases of what level variations of security guards there are.\n\nThe security guards will have flashlights and there will be searchlights at night when the mall is closed and will turn off their lights in the day time since there is a 24-hour day and night cycle.\n\n\nCivic Security Guards are the least aggressive security guard type and will only chase you in little groups until at least phase 2. They wear white security guard outfits with no hats that are short sleeve.\n\nState Security Guards are security guards that wear the same suits as beginner Security guards but they are black and are longsleeve.\n\nFederal Security Guards are the most aggressive security guards. They wear white longsleeve jackets with black police hats. They will start kicking or cart or jumping in front of you.\n\nFederal Secret Security Guards are even more aggressive and they wear black longsleeve jackets with white police hats. They will kick your cart even harder and attempt to push it off the path.\n\nSWAT Carts are security guards that have riot gear and extremely large black shopping carts with an extreme level of weight on them and will attempt to ram you head on at full speed at 3 minute intervals on phase level 3 or higher. The intervals will shorten as the phase gets higher.\n\nRamming into a SWAT Cart will cause you to crash very brutally and be knocked back and your cart or scooter become instantly damaged visually but will not affect performance.\n\nRoadblocks are blocked off areas with wooden barriers with 2 security guards (or even some occasional SWAT carts) in them. You have to ram through the barriers really fast cause if you go slow through them the security guards will catch you and you will instantly get busted if they grab you.\n\nSpike Strips are long strips of spikes that try to stop your cart or scooter. If your tires puncture from it, you will loose all handling and you’ll start going all over the place and go slower but they will instantly reinflate within 30 seconds. They come at phase 4 or higher.\n\nDrones being flown and controlled by Sondia Bay Shopping Mall Security will appear at level 4 or higher and will attempt to follow you around and make sight with you. They have headlights at night and will attempt to swoop down to keep sight of you while being pursued by the rest of the security guards and there will be a certain radius and will keep up with you.\n\nDrones can’t be destroyed by displays. The only way to loose them is to keep out of their sight.\n\n\n\nThere are 5 types of roadblocks.\n\n1. Barrier roadblockst are roadblocks that have no security guards or any equipment or SWAT carts in them, and will only have wooden barriers. They come at phase level 3 or higher and are the easiest to ram through.\n2. Guard roadblocks are roadblocks have 2 security guards with wooden barriers. They come at phase 4 or higher. You will have to ram through them as fast as you can without stopping otherwise the security guards will catch you and you will instantly be busted.\n3. Maximum Security roadblocks are roadblocks with 2 security guards, 2 SWAT carts and wooden barriers with 3 layers. They come at phase level 5 or higher.\n4. Side blocks are roadblocks that don’t block the way but are only on the side and don’t have any challenge avoiding them whatsoever. They come at phase 4 or higher.\n5. Federal Roadblocks are roadblocks that have no way through them. It’s all Security Gaurds and SWAT carts with metal barriers blocking the whole way so you can’t ram through them with a metal wall with orange traffic cones all around them and you can only turn around and go the other way to avoid them. Trying to ram will cause you to wreck and be damaged visually. They come at phase 6 or higher.\n\nYou can’t leave the mall if you are in a pursuit and doing so will have an invisible barrier within the parking lot.\n\n\n\nPhase 1: Only an average of 2 civic security guards chasing you.\n\nPhase 2: An average 5 civic security guards chasing you.\n\nPhase 3: State security guards start chasing you and they get more aggressive. An average of about 11 security guards. At an interval of 3 minutes a SWAT cart will try to ram you head on. There is roadblocks made of wood that you can smash through.\n\nPhase 4: An average of 17 state security guards. SWAT cart. Roadblocks. Drone.\n\nPhase 5: Federal security guards start chasing  you and they are the most aggressive towards you. An average of 20 security guards. SWAT cart. Roadblocks. More aggressive tactics. 2 Drone.\n\nPhase 6: Federal Secret Security Guards. The most aggressive phase level. Average of about 30 security guards. SWAT cart. Roadblocks. The most aggressive tactics. 2 Drones.\n\n\nIf you get busted, you will be re-spawned back at the front door and have to bribe your way back in with money. You simply get busted by allowing the security guards to corner you or come into contact with you without attempting to escape. You can’t get busted on phase 1 since you can apologize your way out of a chase and it’s easier on on Phase 1, but after phase 2, you will instantly get busted if you stop and Security guards are already close to you or if you fail to run fast enough through a roadblock.\n\n\nCooldown mode:\n\nIf you loose sight you will go into cooldown mode and have to find a hiding spot. If you find a hiding spot or loose sight of the security guards your wanted level will slowly go down and the pursuit will end when it completely goes down.\n\nOn your mini-map, there will be hiding spot icons that are indicated by snowflakes and you can reach a hiding spot until the cooldown timer goes down and your heat level gradually goes down as well.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlot:\n\nThe game involves the teenage protagonist Leon, who arrives at the largest mall in the USA called Sondia Bay Shopping Mall (a parody of King of Prussia Mall), in a district called Sondia Bay in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA and is greeted by members of the Chuck Wagon gang. He learns of how they race each other around the mall on shopping carts and kick scooters and place wagers on themselves when racing as well and the stakes are high all the time 24/7 day and night.\n\nLeon gains interest in the sport and starts to do it. He learns of the dangers of having to escape security at the same time. He learned that half of some members who’s names are Smoke, Matt, and Chowder, are now on the mall’s watchlist and have to wear disguises to hide their identities in order to get in. They come in and turn out to be traitors, and hijack the Chuck Wagon gang and fill the whole entire mall with their own side gangs and take over the place.\n\nAfter the disaster, Leon and the Chuck Wagon gang now have to take over the mall like they did before by defeating all 10 gangs in the mall.\n\nZambiah\nChild Club\nElectric Eel\nRoyal Lock\nDirt Sock Inc\nHappy Chap Company\nGobble Club\nFlying Raccoons \nThe Sunshine Group\nSmok’d Matte Chowder\n\nAfter defeating all of them, Smoke challenges Leon to a face-off race in which Leon wins and Smoke, Matt, and Chowder, now at the point of being weak, now have to choice but to leave the mall. Leon and the Chuck Wagon are now back in business and get a call from their good friend Sashimi who invites them to to Japan to the largest mall there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRaces:\n\n\n\nCircuit Race is a race laps in a fixed circle area.\n\n\nSprint Race is a race from point A to point B.\n\n\nDrag Race is a straight race on a straight line and hitting the perfect shifts.\n\n\nDrift Race is either a Circuit Race or Sprint Race in which you have to collect a certain number of points by drifting in order to beat the target score. You cannot use a kick scooters for this event.\n\n\nTrick Battle is a mode in which you have to complete a certain number of tricks in order to beat the target score. This can only be performed with a kick scooter.\n\n\nCrowd Battle is a race mode where there are you and the another opponent and you have to keep up with opponent racer by staying close to them to collect points from point A to point B through an extremely crowded sector of the mall. The pedestrians can’t be ran over so therefore they aren’t a hazard and are added just for dramatic effect, the only challenge is hitting a solid object once will cause you to total your cart or scooter. The further you stay ahead the more points you collect. After you finish the end, you go into the race phase 2 where this time the roles are reversed and you have to avoid them from keeping up with you. The race instantly ends if you wreck or outrun the opponent and stay ahead within 10 seconds.\n\nCrowd Battles are the biggest payout out of all of the races in the game since they are the most challenging.\n\n\nMilestone Races are racers where you have to escape the security guards in a pursuit and you have to preform a certain tasks such wreck a certain number of displays, ram through a number of roadblocks or maintain a pursuit for a certain time and then escape. \n\nYou have to compete the task and then escape the pursuit and you will get a cash reward.\n\n\nLockdown is a race type in which the mall is on lockdown and you have to race across from Point A to Point B while at Heat Level 6 while there are alarms and people panicking and having to avoid being busted by the security guards.\n\nThe security guard are all Secret Federal Guards that full up the whole mall and will do anything and everything they can to stop you in this race and there is an EXTREME amount of security guards and they are practically doing everything they can to stop you from even finishing the race.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShopping Cart/Kick Scooter Customization:\n\nYou can customize your shopping cart or scooter with upgrades and you gain extra stamina by racing more. Your stamina goes up +5 if you continuously race around for 5 minutes.\n\nYou can also purchase Speed Boost, which is a special ability to make your cart or scooter go faster for a short time (similar to nitrous). It costs up to $6,000 to purchase from the upgrade shop at the mall.

8d8q9r,Scattered thoughts on conversation within games,"After playing through Oxenfree and watching Mark Brown's [video](https://youtu.be/bCJw4hQkPj4) about the game: Event[0] in his Game Maker's Toolkit series, I've found myself quite interested in (and perhaps a little obsessed with) the topic of conversation within games.\nI've let these thought brew for about a week now and while I have a lot of thoughts and ideas, I still have not come to a conclusion in the form of a fully fledged game idea (which I had originally hoped to). So instead I've decided to share some of my ideas &amp; opnions, to help clear my own mind on them, to share them with other people who may find them usefull and to hopefully get a bit of feedback on them. So without further ado:\n\n***If you want to skip straight to the game idea part, go ahead and scroll to the header called 'Game Ideas' as this post will be more of a explanation &amp; exploration of game design and mechanics.***\n\n## Types of conversational systems\n\nFirst of all, I should probably define what I mean when I talk about conversation as a game mechanic. This covers any mechanic where the player controls a character and is able to influence or directly control what that chracter will say to or talk about with other characters within the game (NPCs).\n\nThe three most promenent examples of this (in my experience), are 'Multiple Choice', 'Optional Questions' and 'Free-Text'. I'll mostly be exploring Free-Text as I find it the most intresting of the three, but more on that later. (btw these are all names I just made up, and I expect that most of these have actual terms within the indrustry that are way smarter. They simply serve as labels that I can call back to)\n\n### Multiple Choice\nThis system is heavily used in narrative based games like Oxenfree and Telltale Games, where you are often forced into conversation and then have to decide how to respond from a limted set of option (often three), either saying something or doing a specfic action. Some of these systems also set a timer for how long you have to choose an option, where exceeding this time will either result in not answering, a default answer or some other consequence. One of the major problems with this system is properly labeling options. It isn't very practical for the game to list the entire line that will be said, so often it's substituted for a label that tries to convey the whole line. However this sometimes leads to player characters saying something that the player didn't intend, which makes them feel cheated by the game. Some games have tried different things to fix this problem, like 'Life is Strange' where you have the ability to rewind time a few seconds, making you able to take back something you've just said. The other big problem with this system is that the player usually either have very limited answering options (forcing the dialogue to lead to close-ended answers, so the player doesn't feel like they're missing a lot of options) or they make the conversation feel drawn out and rigid because the player has to read through a large number of options. Either way, not that great.\n\n### Optional Questions\n\nOptional questions is what you see in games like Skyrim, where you can engage NPCs in conversation and from there you are presented with an array of options of topics to ask or converse about. Now this mechanic is easy for the player to execute, it often gives them a chance to avoid dialogue, it doesn't results in anything unexpected and works very well for games that don't actually focus that heavily on conversation. However, it is also one of the most boring ways of giving the player conversational choices. The most fundamental problem with this mechanic is that it natuarally leads to the player mostly asking questions and the NPC mostly answering them, something which doesn't feel like a natural conversation. Do this over 100 times and your NPCs begin to feel more like info dumps with a face, rather than whatever they were supposed to be. Besides that big flaw, this mechanic also suffers from some of the flaws of the 'Multiple Choice' system, namely limited options and the risk of mislabeling. Now many game using this system also incorporate other things, like cutscenes, tempoarily switching to a 'Multiple Choice'-like system, etc. and when done right, they are well received.\n\n### Free-Text\nLastly, there's the controversial system where you have the ability to write out your own answers. The idea with this system is giving the player the ability to say whatever they want, which also serves to make them think through their character. The obvious problem with this option is that giving the player the option to write anything, means you will have to find ways to respond to both a VERY large number of things and inevidably you will have to make decisions for how to answer non-sense. A side-note is that the player has to type out what they plan to say, which makes this system unsuitable for fast pased gameplay.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nRegardless, the Free-Text system is the one I am most fascinated by, because it presents the dream of a perfect solution where the game could really mimic true conversation. And the problems standing in the way of this dream are very open ended, giving more space for intresting solutions and innovation.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAlso, if you know of any conversational game system completely unlike these three, please let me know as I would love to look at alternative solutions.\n\n## Conversating NPCs\nNow, many Free-Text games cut the game down to a single NPC. This is a smart move as multiple NPCs would either require WAY more writing to mimic different personalities or take away the illusion of natural conversation by having the NPCs be bland or too similar.\n\nBut, if you've limited your game to only contain one NPC which will be able to have conversations with the player that presents a unique situation/oppetunity. Because the game will most likely have to revolve around this NPC or the relation between the player and the NPC, as a lot of work will go into making this system great, which would be wasted if the core of the game was something completely different. So if you only have a single NPC, that **better** be an intresting fella, or your entire game might as well be thrown in the thrash (or more realisticly end up in the pits of the internet where noone ever goes, because it's the game is not popular or relevant enough to be found). It's a double-edged sword.\n\nA clever idea used in Event[0] is having this central NPC be an AI/computer/robot. Firstly this makes the player feel less awkward for typing everything down, as the mere act of typing will also serve as roleplaying your chracter, since the player will literally be doing the same thing as their character. Another upside, is that all the flaws of the Free-Text systems which are mostly conversational mistakes, can be relatively easily blamed on the NPC rather than the game itself, as most people will be more forgiving of a machine misunderstanding them, avoiding answering or other conversational abnormalities.\n\n## Distance Problem\nNow that we've decided that the game will either be about the core NPC or the relationship between the player character and the NPC, this will also go on to influence other parts of the game. Particularly the map/level design will somehow have to accommodate for the player to be able to easily strike up a contersation with the core NPC. There are multiple solutions for this: having a small / no map, having the either the player character or the NPC follow the other or carrying the other, having multiple copies or versions of either the player character or the NPC, being able to conversate anywhere by some means (like a cellphone or another device) or being able to travel fast or instantanious.\n\nThere's really no right answer for how you deal with these problems, but some will be more suited than others depending on the nature of the NPC and the player character.\n\n## The Player Character\n\nMany games using conversation systems with option will either present the players with a blank slate chracter and try to present vastly different options for the player to let them roleplay the way *they* want, or they will have some predetermined notion of the character and the choices will be more flavorfull, giving the player the option to put their own personal touch on their version of the character, but not actually changing the character completely.\n\nWhich one of these is good and which one is the evil spawn of Satan can be debated in the internet comments, but the Free-Text system definetly has an easier time with a blank slate. Giving the player the option to say anything also means that they will have to option to completely betray any prearranged character trait, morals or personality quirks. Now there are of cause ways to work around this and sometimes counting on the player to just 'play along' can be viable, but leaving the player atleast leaning towards bland and blank is the safest bet as the player will then have the option to decide who they are for themselves.\n\n## Tempo\n\nAnother important concept within conversational systems is tempo. A good example of this is Oxenfree, which is a narrative 'Multiple Choice' game that allows the player to interrupt the NPCs and let's that naturally be part of the conversation by cutting them off and using phrases like 'anyways' and 'so, as I was saying' to catch up (or drops the line if it was almost finished or unimportant).\n\nAnother important thing for tempo is the time it takes for the player to express the thought they want and for the game to pick up on it. As you could probably imagine, Free-Text games have some serious trouble with this one, as it ruins the flow of a conversation every time the game has to wait for the player to finish writing out a sentence. Some Free-Text games tries to get around this by having the wait/pause feel more natural, for example in a game about texting on your phone, it would be expected that waiting would occour. However, some would consider that more of a loop-hole than an actual fix to the underlying problem.\n\n# Game Ideas\n\nNow, based on some of these thought and topics I've tried to come up with a few game ideas. \n\n**I would really appreciate feedback on these!**\n\nA part of me just wants to throw all of these concepts and game ideas together, but I'm pretty sure that it would result in a mess with no clear meaning or direction, trying to do too much all at once.\n\n## Idea No. 1 - *Just say 1.*\n\nSince communicating is the core mechanic, why not *gamify* it a bit more?\n\nIn this game you play as a simple AI cube conversing with your creator (another AI). You start out only being able to communicate 'true' and 'false', resulting in very limited dialogue options. Gameplay then becomes about finding or building chips/parts that allow you to expand your vocabulary / way of expressing yourself, which would likely result in puzzle-like gameplay, with a possibility for multiple systemic game systems (another game topic I find interesting).\n\n## Idea No. 2 - *Am I AI?*\n\nNow this one is more of a thematic idea, so it'll be very vague.\nI wanted to make a game that commented on Advanced AI and the difference (or lack thereof) between AI and humans. The gameplay would be mostly conversation with an AI. The conclusion of the game would be the player deciding whether they considered the AI to be sentient. There needs to be a reason for the answer to that question to matter for the story, like having done something that is only allowed for one of the two (can an AI commit murder? Is breaking the rules of it's code neccicarily an error? etc.). Possible plot twist could be that the player character is actually an AI, and that the player is actually the one being evaluated.\n\nLike I said, this one is still very much is the brewing phase, but presents some oppetunties for presenting a relevant and interesting overarching theme/point which is always nice...\n\n## Idea No. 3 - *All story, no shell*\n\nThis game will be taking place completely inside a terminal, where the player character will conversate with an AI to learn about the state and story of the game. Now to give a reason for them to be forced to do nothing but converse they will have to either want something particular from the AI or be trapped (either literally or figuratively) and left with little other options. Now since this game idea revolves largely around the story I will try to be a bit more specific and give an example as to how it could go:\n\n*After waking up on a small department of a spaceship after long time cryotic freeze / coma, the player needs to talk with an uncooporative AI to learn what has happend. The original ship was a large vessal, controlled by an AI named ARTHUR, whose mission was to find and colonize a long-term inhabitable planet. After a mysterious accident the ship was forced to detach a small section leaving only the player and a copy of ARTHUR to float out into empty space. The copy has since then lost signal to the main ship and with no updates and lack of other companions, it has only communicated with itself for a long time, resulting in some weird mutations to it's code as it could only error-fix off it's own flawed analysis of itself. The player is left to unravel what actually happend based on an unreliable companions records and to make decisions on how to best save the situation, if it's still possible.*\n\n(And yes, I am using cryo/coma as the reason the player character has the same prior knowledge as the player, even though I know it's an overused trope, fight me!)\n\nAlternatively, there could be a small 3D room for the player to explore for clues to ask about (name on a labcoat, company name on mechanical parts, general atmosphere, etc.)\n\n#Afterthoughts\n\n* Which idea did you prefer?\n\n* What are your ideas for Free-Text conversational games?\n\n* What are there any pros and cons for these systems that I missed?\n\n* Which game concept is most interesting: A Human(Player) talking to an AI(NPC) or an AI(Player) talking to an AI(NPC)?"
8d8hrx,"A top-down, stealth game with mirror-gunplay","  That title probably makes no sense, let me explain. You would get planted down into a procedurally generated house, bunker or stronghold (depending on the difficulty). You would be tasked with killing all enemies in your way and stealing a document. You will be armed with a maxim-9, no armor or medical supplies, limited ammo and the ability to deflect bullets off mirrors. This ability will have 2 forms; 1. You can use mirrors on the map to kill enemies without exposing yourself, and 2. as a last-ditch effort, you can deflect bullets using your hand. The game will feature a fog of war, and the excessive amounts of mirrors around the level will allow you to see out of view areas. These mirrors will also act as a disadvantage though, allowing enemies that face mirrors to see you in the reflection. You will die in 1 shot from enemies, forcing players to take their time and plan their approach."
8d87yo,"An open world MMO weapon building game. Like scrap mechanic but with weapons, and sandbox survival aspects."," This has basically been in the back of my head for the past month. The main ""hook"" of the game would be the ability to create weapons, armor and more advanced devices from simple components. You would progress through different ""ages"", starting in the stone age, making simple clubs and tools. You would later advance through the various ages, eventually ending at near future. This system could work, or possibly a post-apocalyptic setting would work. It would let tinker and test weapons, refining them to be more cost-efficient and effective. The game would use semi-realistic physics, but straying slightly for the sake of fun. People could sell off their designs to player run companies that would mass produce them for sale to other players, or sell them to groups and clans for exclusive use.\n   This system would give rise to 3 types of players, designers, producers, and consumers. Consumers would be amateur players with less time to sink into the game, producers would be richer players and would eventually refine into bigger, well-known companies that would compete against each other. Designers would be the brighter bunch, developing weapons for these giants. Different clans would compete for ground in this world, giving a use for weapons. This territory would give resources and money from cities and villages, they could then sell the resources to producers for various prices. This whole system would give rise to economics and wars.\n  Now onto the design system, I have been mentioning all too often. It would start with the base, essentially making solid parts to house components, it would be reminiscent of programmes like Autodesk. You would then be able to put these parts and components together in a 3D editor (Think of the spore creature creator but with machines). A good example would be a crossbow, you would create a base, then add arms and wire/string (I'm not a genius on crossbows). You could then proceed to add an area for the bolt to rest, a catch and trigger system, and top it off with a scope.\n  I know this game is incredibly farfetched and I don't know how many people would like this sort of thing. But I just needed to get this out there for others to see and criticize.\n\n\n\n*Please go easy on my brainchild*"
8d7tsr,"The destined hero dies asking you to fulfill his quest, thus turning the adventure game into a brutal survival journey.","This is a combination of The Hero's Journey story (e.g. The Lord of the Rings or The Odyssey) and a survival genre game. As common as each are in fiction and games, I'm surprised they haven't been fully combined to my knowledge.\n\nThe story starts in a secluded, far-off village nestled next to a Zelda-like temple. A hero comes to your village, enters the temple to fight its monster and retrieve the McGuffin. Dark forces attack the village and fatally wound the hero. Only women and children remain. The hero gives you the McGuffin and pleads that you deliver it to the queen at the far side of the kingdom.\n\nThe game becomes a wilderness survival game along a linear journey across multiple biomes. You have to hunt for food, gather recourses and fend off or run from predators/monsters that the hero would have easily dispatched if it were a different game. You pass through varied townships and villages to resupply, and notice that they're all in a desperate struggle for survival too, because the hero hasn't come to save them.\n\nIn what seems like the end of the game, after you deliver the McGuffin to the queen, all the once-hopeless people ask you to journey to the demon king's realm and slay him once and for all. They think you're the hero. If you choose to lie and pretend for their sake, you're surely not coming back from this journey."

8d6291,Battle Royale on a sinking cruise ship,"This is probably just an idea for a PUBG/Fortnite level, but it should be set on a sinking cruise ship (like the Titanic ).  \n\nThere's one single lifeboat (or floating door, I guess) and obviously everyone wants to get it.  It has to be located, unlocked, transported to the deployment area, and deployed, so its not just grabbing it and winning instantly.\n\nThe big hook of this is that as the ship sinks the entire level rotates, until the ship is almost totally vertical in the water.  (It could also do a barrel roll like the Poseidon adventure, which would be interesting too).\n\nThe water would start to fill the ship as it rotates too.  It would be cold and do damage but not be instantly lethal, so maybe it would be worth it sometimes to jump off the boat and swim around to another area.\n\nWeapons are all the stuff you'd expect to find on a fancy cruise ship--cutlery, kitchen knives, shovels (from the steam engine room), oars, boat hooks, flare guns, overwrought Celene Dion music, etc.  Maybe the captain's room has a revolver locked away too.\n\n"

The classes you can play as are some variation of each prefab (cube, cylinder, sphere, etc).\n\n\nAn example battle moment is being airborne with a lot of energy about to be dispensed on an opponent. Before you continue, you can assign buffs/talents to maximize the hit. How hard your last hit is on the prefab enemy determines the loot threshold as if you were always playing a high striker game to get more powerful items.\n\n\nThe progression involves always needing to jump higher or further to reach new purchasable (from game gold) checkpoints of fast travel or reach certain weak points on enemies.

Items will also come into play with buff combinations and the right movement stats to get into new areas or unlock secrets. \n\nEvery npc in the game follows a randomized daily schedule. It's based on a recipe of items the npc is given, and it will spend its time going to fetch/grind those items in the game world to make random stuff. For example, if you catch some unit halfway building some armor for the day, you will loot the mats he's been farming up. If you had waited until later you would loot the finished armor.\n\nIt could even be a self made rpg where everything is on an prefab user market, so the vanilla game starts with a typical rpg theme for all the naming conventions and models, but you can change it all up and use the market or your own primitive designs to render each npc and name them."

8d1cs1,Combined campaign and battle royale game in the transformers franchise,"Hi!\n\nI originally thought of posting this game idea to Hasbro. But they do not accept ideas from other places than the U.S.\n\nMaybe someone here has contacts within Hasbro or game studios with licencing to produce games for Hasbro.\n\nThis is aimed to be a huge mainstream game.

Unlocks rewards (As in skins, attachments or other various items that does not enhance user game performance, as this is not to be a ""pay to win"" game) that can be used in Battle royale. So that the user can display its progress in campaign-mode to other users.\n\n3. **Battle royale plot**\n\nThe battle-royale mode can be 1-5 players, as in single, duo, open squad (1-5 players in squad vs up to 5 other players in squads) quad squad (locked 4p squads), penta squad (locked 5p squads). Map rotation/selection: Earth or Cybertron. (Can be more maps later updates). You can select either or both map(s) in the lobby. You can also select a character (One of autobots or decepticons). The characters has its own movability feature, like if you select Optimus prime you are able to transform to a truck and drive on the map, or starscream, you can transform to a jet-fighter. To balance these differences, there will be restrictions on either weaponizing or backpack capabilities. This is more informed in my document about the game.\n\n\nPlayers are being sent down like fireballs over the sky. Much like in the movies, controlling the comet starts high up in the sky, and you can reach the whole map, and crashes into the planet. You then can go and loot items/weapons. Items may be like weapons, jet-pack, repair kits etc. As a transformer, you pick it up by generating magnetism/electrical beams and installing the weapon on the transformer-body. Much like the healing-part in the transformers movie where Optimus Prime gained extra features. Action-bar and backpack. You can also find transformer parts to replace on the transformer to increase the armor on the autobot. \n\nThere are also thoughts of making each transformer character with a special skill. Like Healing, weapon upgrading etc. Much like the special skills the transformers have in the movies.\n\nMuch deeper plot and mode information is written down, but this is the basic idea of the game.\n\n\n\n***-The_BulletStorm***\n\n"

8k6dr6,Ideas for an open world zombie game.,"Just imagine an open world rpg game in a world like the walking dead. Different communities, good and bad ones. Smaller settlements, as well as large ones that are very organised. Lone travellers and cannibal groups. You can build a camp/settlement and eventually a little town and attract other people and expand your settlement something like fallouts building mechanics but with much smarter a.i. .To make the communities feel real.  You should go out and find resources to build. Produce food etc. You would need people with certain skills to make good soldiers or a eugene/smart character for more technological equipment or windmills etc. To make this world/settlement feel alive if you have a church for example some people would go. People will mourn their dead loved ones at the graves, just details like this. As your settlement grows and is happy (enough food water, security) you attract more people. Eventually being able to create an “army” (not thousands but a hundred or so skilled and veterans). Build better defences, like digging ditches, these things should take time and you would see your settlers doing the work, actually digging and moving the sand around, or creating pikes with a hatchet. You could make alliances and trade agreements. But you would start out alone finding shelter from zombies en finding gear etc. Horses/carts for transport. Giving settlers jobs, a baker a smith, guards, soldiers, farmers etc. All doing their thing, some would have families etc. Just imagine building your defences and walls and then having to defend against a giant horde of roamers or a hostile settlement. \n\nImagine finding a large mall full of resources and settling down there, building defences, fortifying the windows doors etc, building a farm on the roof etc. Attracting new settlers.   You could go as deep as you want, for example a trust system where not everyone you take in can be trusted and will cause some deaths or steal and leave. Or maybe they are from another group trying to see how they could take over. \n\nThis is all over the place i know, I just love building in fallout 4 and I love a world overrun by zombies. I’m just putting some thoughts out there in the hope someone reads this and does something with it. "
8k1l1c,Indy Game Ideas Wanted,"Hey everyone, I'm looking to design/develop a video game over the summer and I was looking for ideas. Nothing too in depth, just a base game mechanic or something like that. Thanks!"
8k0mu1,|Rushing Towards Death| Rough Game; Main Ideas,"Main game structure is a **RPG . Base Builder . Side Scrolling \(probably\) . Wave Defence**\n\nI've thought a lot about this idea and have complied quite a few unique mechanics, balancing methods and relations between different genres that might create an amazing game. Though for the sake of avoiding a massive wall of confusing text I'll talk about he main text here. Ill list below all the different areas I've thought about if anyone interested and if there is enough ill make a prt 2 to this. \n\nAlso note since this seems to be the best way to write this I'm kind of just pitching it to you guys since....well it just sounds better. \n\n**Idea I**: The Playable Character\n\nSo in short this combines mainly with the idea within Base Building, which is unlike most RPGs' their is no player decided classes and no levelling system. Instead, all equipment while needing to be found, can be worn and in the best attempt, equally balanced. Equipment within this game is less about gaining bonus stats and more granting the abilities that decide your class, this allows players to freely change the playstyle out of combat and grant the maximum amount of freedom. Equipment affects active abilities \(thinking 4 total Weapon:Body:Helmet:Boots\) and should be as equally balanced as possible. \n\nNow this puts players in a interesting position, since technically a low level player with enough skill \(this is assuming PvP capabilities\) could defeat a high level...There is a balance in this though, an that is Relics. Relics are items which provide passive effects to players, structure or even affect the game on a global level as well as coming in many different levels. The Player can have \(technically\) an unlimited amount of Relics active at any time, however this is not very feasible since the Relics tie directly into the base building mechanics of the game as explained in the next idea. If PvP \n\n**Idea II:** Base Building \n\nNow this idea was initially decided upon not as the primary core mechanic of the game but I realised so many ways in which it can be used for balancing and providing a fun experience for players. Putting aside basics like power generation consuming resources etc, I'll focus on the unique things which set this apart from other ideas. The first one is based off the Relics, Relics initially gathered by the player aren't very useful, since the player cant actually use them. In order to harness a relic, the player has to construct structures which can house and provide them with enough power to run, different level relics require more power and eventually a few good relics add up to a massive cost to the player but if they are willing to put in the effort and time...you can become semi god\-like. \n\nOther Ideas I've expanded upon are they are in order of how well I thought them out:he player losses, what happens if swarms of enemies destroy the defences and destroy his base. Introducing Bunkers: these structures are underground structures that provide a certain area that in the case of the game, are invincible. Your can place anything from Relics, to Mass storage in their. They do however require power to run and if the base is destroyed in order to gain access to them, the player has to get power back to it. Please note that for this game I was thinking that general terrain is invincible and only structures can be destroyed. \n\n**Idea III:** Dungeon and Wave Defence\n\n Other Ideas I've expanded upon starting off with most well thought out to least::increases in difficulty as you go deeper \(isnt one map but mini areas that vanish once completed\).  Resources, Relics, Blue prints doesn't matter what you get from it the primary concept to be taken away from this is how it interacts and balances with the Wave Defence. The idea behind this is each time you kill a unique enemy, its added to the possible spawnable units that can attack your base, this mechanic also acts as a better incentive to go deeper since in order to balance this monsters up top WILL also start dropping better stuff. Its an interesting mechanic that implements a double edged sword to the player an personally is while is quite small, I think vastly increases the complexity of the game. This is also why the title \(needs work\) is what it is because the faster you try and do the game the harder it is. \n\nOther Ideas I've expanded upon starting off with most well thought out to least::increases in difficulty as you go deeper \(isn't one map but mini areas that vanish once completed\).

8jzs8x,Game concept: An infinite rpg dungeon crawler.,I was thinking about making an rpg that goes on untile you die. It would have a adventure time feel with fantasy mixed in with science fiction and a loot of neat looking and colorful items. Enemy’s would drop tons loot that you could use and your character would be very customizable. Every so often there would be a boss battle that gives you tons of loot. Loot can be weapons or armor that does different things and can change your play style at any theme.  As you go on the enemy’s get more health and do more damage.\n\nDoes this sound like a good consept? \nP.s. should it be top down or turn based. I like turn based but I think it would get annoying after a while.
8jx7rl,Need help expanding idea,"I've been working on a game (possibly a platformer) and I'm not sure what else to add cause it's not fun too play now. But anyway in the game there are 4 playable characters, each character represents a color (red, blue, green, purple). When you are controlling the red character you are only able to see red objects and same goes with the other characters and their colors. But when the red character is touching a red object the other characters are able to see it and walk on it. I did come up with an idea of a black object that take the color out of something causing the player to fall through the object. But other than that I can't think of anything. If anyone has suggestions I would really appreciate it."
8jwlan,evoXPi,"evo-beat m up story rpg \n\n\nexample: 1 vs 1 match \nYou not choose your character in a menue before, you evolve into the character during the match/game.\n\n\nTwo empty vacuous puppets just sitting in the world, this world slowly generates XP for each of them.\nThe beginning of a match is quite slow, this allowes the player to prepare and align the tactic.\nIn a special moment a XP breach allowes the player to put a stats point into the stats slots and during the game you evolve the 3 stats.\nRed for OffenCE - Green for IntelligenCE - Blue for DefenCE - the RGB called. The RGB evolves with SP you get for XP and the amount and setting of the SP in the RGB define your LP. More DefenCE SPs generating more LP.\n\n\nEvery skill is linked to one of this stats. When the program evolves with his XP stats it unlocks new skills you can upgrade your character with. The combination of the stat points indicates in percentage your individuell or required stats set up. You can also find this indicator in the gameworld if it is existing. \nsimple example 60%RED/10%Green/30%Blue = more damage dealing playstyle or aggressive world settings\nThis is what the opponent can see. Not what skills you are choosing until played. Not what skill you evolved with XP ..until played..it is always a good idea to keep a finisher evolving in mind for your opponent ;) \nWith XP you can evolve your skills too. From a peaceful breeze to a devastating storm.\n\n\nThere is a slow down option which allowes the player in a few seconds for setting/boosting the skills. Or I like the defenCE evolvement process which provides you time by creating barriers or damage absorbing features. \n\n\nSkins are for rpg design purpose but also they are offering boosts for certain skills or allowing the program to visit certain areas of the gameworld. You can evolve skins too. \n\n\nHow you use your XP on your character and the world will define your way to play.\n\n\nIf a gameworld is existing:\nYou will need almost for everything XP. To open gates, supporting events or just travelling the world. You can also visit the dark markets and buy some nice skin or item for your XP. But you cannot purchase XP or transfer XP in multiplayer (if existing) to another player without any balanced game item (quest or craft). XP is always something you only earn by doing things in the world. It is the most powerful thing and the most valuable currency. Especially if you work together to awake story items. With loot from the world and the necessary skill you will be able to craft items and sell them for xp.\n\n\nThe engine defines how the game evolves. A live action game engine would be nice xD, a card game, grow game, round based strategy is possible and I was also thinking to do a more text written excelventure. I want to explain more in detail how every gamedesign can be addapted to the idea. \n\n\nabout the story\n\n\nMankind settled into cyberspace, but in the world they are left behind the process of creating artifical intelligence is still in progress processed by automatic scripts written from the last humans taken care. In a special moment the automatic scripts completed the task and the true AI was born. With no name, and awaken in the cloud offside the human network the AI was looking after her creator and started calculating into the cyberspace to meet the humans who created it. Maybe of a program mistake during log in the AI crashed into the humans cyberspace world and created a bubble surrounded by shards. The gameworld where the stories takes place. The shards look like different flat worlds drifting in space. The human cyberspace program was crashed and the AI unable to interact with the world. Unable to find ""the parents"" it tried coding his own special form of life with the ability to leave the planetshaped dome and reach for the shards. The NO1 (the Non Orininal One) based on the archimedes constant vanished any desperation. The NO1 was designed in the shape of a vacuous human puppet, only empty..but with the coded core of Pi in every moment the programs core react with the world by gaining XPi and unlocks the 3 stats keeping it alive and the Life Bar up. The RGB!!\n\nNow you can see!!\nAfter a few more glances...\n""NO1 XP gained!! Now you can hear!!\n\n...story continues.\n...patch this sometimes\n\nThank you for reading whould be nice to have some discusion, feedback or questions.\n\n"

I wanted a game where you can walk a see all the different environments and buildings.\nBUT every time I ask someone for advice I always get the same, what about cyperpunk or steampunk and I wanted something other then that \nAlso i think fantasy is overplayed in video games."
8johqp,Mad-Libs type game that pulls text from the web,"Set parameters for where the text is pulled (news sites, short story fan fiction page,....). The program then identifies and pulls words, asks for replacements, then once you have entered them it replaces the pulled words and posts the edited text with a link to the original.\n\nOptional multiplayer where people take turns filling in words."

8jmx7o,An alternative take on the King of Dragon Pass formula,"I really like King of Dragon Pass's core gameplay. Specifically, I like how the story is delivered in the form of small, personal dilemmas while a council of advisers gives you conflicting opinions on what to do. I think there's a lot of potential to apply the core mechanics to other settings.\n\nFor example, you could play as the ship's computer on a generation spaceship (think Wall-E). Manage the internal squabbles of your crew and external cosmic threats until you safely get to your destination, 1000 lightyears away. Do you try to maintain a Star Trek-style socialist utopia, or a HAL-style iron-fist regime?\n\nWhat are your thoughts?"
8jm4kz,A comedic rpg set in Aztec times.,I was thinking of a game where you play an explorer who arrived and must find a long lost artifact. You would met many different characters on the way and see weird oddities as you explore. There would be a lot of customizations as you can find cloths and relics that can really change your play style. \n(Sorry if this seams vague I just wanted to hear some of your ideas or opinions about this.)
8jm1hs,2 part idea,"It would be a post apocalyptic setting, dreary, dark and full of fking psychos. Maybe an FPS shooter cross open world (Fallout/Far cry maybe). \nCharacter is somehow new to the setting and is fighting while adjusting. Slowly over the span of the game the character will rise to the top after toppling corrupt towns while also losing himself to it all. The game ends with the character conquering all in his area and restores peace, for a price, he/she will never get the satisfaction they want and has now changed almost completely.\n\nSequel would be the same setting but with the remnants of the military, they are trying to bring militarily dictated order back to the world and must take it from a massive warlord that has taken over quarter of the country. Towards the end you find out its the same character from the first game and maybe there are references from choices you made in the first game (scars, companions, etc.). No idea how it would end though, maybe someone would have an idea.. "
8jk40p,"Need help with 3 ideas, can't decide what game to develop next","Dear all,\n\nI have the problem that I have some ideas for games which I'd love to develop but cannot decide which one would be the most promising one. My goal is not to make money out of them, it's just kind of games I like and love to play by myself. None of this ideas is new btw, but I think all of them would be fun.\n\nSo here's my list:\n\n**Gladiator Manager**\n\nThis would be a multiplayer (turn based) game like a football manager but where you manage your gladiators, equip them and make them better due to training and arena fights. They will gain experience for fights, money and all that stuff and of course there would be kind of a transfer market and international leader boards with several different leagues. Best match would be [Hattrick](https://hattrick.org) as a football manager game.\n\nThe arena battles could be done automatically like in other manager games. Target platforms would be PC (executable and browser) and mobiles\n\n**Roguelike Sonar Game**\n\nWell this one is kind of a 2d top down game where you're just in the dark and have your sonar with you to survive in scifi environment. The story is not clear, could be that you stranded with your space ship on a planet and all you've left is your sonar with an almost empty battery. This doesn't need to be necessarily roguelike (turn based) but could be realtime as well.\n\nI even created a small prototype for this kind of game, maybe it's easier to understand what I mean when you just look at this: [Sonobots](http://sonobots.com/game/html5)\nShould run in any browser, but I've tested only Chrome...\n\nOne idea would be to do this multiplayer where several players would try to reach whatever the goal could be. The point is to seek and hide. Target platform would be PC (executable and browser) and maybe mobiles.\n\n**Card Game**\n\nThis is easy to explain, just a card game like Crazy8, Skat, Romme... Even though there are tons of them out there, I think there are still good ones missing, especially supporting multiplayer.\n\nTarget platform would be mainly mobiles, with the option to play in a browser as well.\n\nSo that's it. My dilemma is that I like all of those but need a kick into a specific direction. ;)\n\nTHANKS"
8jjf7n,Gaming Circuit,"I've had this idea for a while.\n\nBut a gaming circuit.\n\nA tournament that has four games.\n\nGames would be games like LoL, CS:GO, Fortnite, and Smash/(any fighter that allows multiple people to fight at the same time).\n\nThe idea of the circuit is to test the ability for teams to demonstrate their ability to be adept at multiple games.\n\nTheir would be eight players per team.\n\nX players per game.  + x Subs.\n\nSo league would have 5 players with 3 subs.  \n\nCS:GO would have 5 players with 3 subs.\n\nFortnite would have 4 players with 4 subs.\n\nSmash would have 4 players with 4 subs.\n\nThis allows teams to allow players to accel at a game.  \n\nSuch as you have 2 players extremely good at league with 3 subpar players.\n\n2 players that are extremely good at CS:GO with 3 subpar.\n\netc etc."
8jh5al,I wanted to make a rpg where you can equipped as much as you can.,"I love games where you can find tons of loot that can change your play style. So I was thinking of some ideas and here is what I got so far\n\n1 a game where you have to buy on tons of cloths. \nYou would have a slots for things like shirts, pants, hats, shoes, etc, you could buy cloths or find them in the open. You would have only a few slots so you would have to choose what you want to wear wisely.\n\n2 a eat em up. \nThat wasn’t auto correct. A game where you can eat as much as you like. The effects would be permanent you they could upgrade your heath or your attack damage. There would be permandeath  so you would have to be very careful during combat.\n(P.s. i was thinking of a similar thing but with alcohol.)\n\n3 make your weapon \nYou would start of with a normal sword  and steals but after a while you can find many other swords and shields too, but you could also find upgrades like handles that adds fire damage or a blade that steals health. The same with shields, as if you block a enemy’s attack perfectly something would happen like they would be stunned.\n\nThat’s all I got so far, what do you think?\n "

8jesan,Which do you prefer: 2d from the side or top-down?,"I'm imaging a spaceship/station-building game with 2d pixel graphics... Would you rather build a ship/station from a side perspective (like Terraria, Oxygen not included, etc.) or a top-down perspective (like FTL, Pokemon, Cardinal Quest 2, etc.)? Why do you prefer that perspective?"
8jdme4,A Multiplayer solarmax webgame,"Hey so this is more of a request for discussion or ideas of how to make something viable. I hope that is okay, since it seems to still be in the spirit of this sub. \n\nIf you're not familiar with solarmax, you can check out solarmax 2 here: [https://www.kongregate.com/games/bjwali/solarmax\-2](https://www.kongregate.com/games/bjwali/solarmax-2)\n\nThe gist of the game is that you control little spaceships \(basically just rendered as individual moving pixels\) and try to capture other planets. There is AI that controls their own ships, and when you and the AI both get on a planet your ships do battle, with the numerically superior side coming eventually out on top. Planets spawn more ships, so the more planets you have the more powerful you become. I really loved that game and thought it could be a great multiplayer IO\-style game, but I'm not sure if it's possible to get it right or not. \n\nIn an IO game, you want players to be able to jump in and out with ease, and you want newer players to be able to compete, or atleast farm up to a level where they can compete, with someone who has been playing for 3 hours already. Also IO games generally need to not be too mechanically intense, or 'micro\-heavy'. You don't want it to feel like playing starcraft, as that is a game that takes a long time to master, and new players will feel overwhelmed going up against more experienced players, and your game will struggle to grow its playerbase. So the problem is that if the map is big enough to hold 40 players like a typical IO game can, players who have been playing for a while will grow huuuge in size and their territory would cover multiple screens. It would be very mechanically difficult to manage a war on multiple sides, and people looking for a typical IO game might shy away from that? \(tell me if I'm wrong, I don't know\). Also players with huge territories would snowball into unstoppable forces in any sort of 1v1 engagement, which means players who are just jumping into the server will feel like it's unfair and will probably quit very quickly.\n\nSo it seems like it has a bunch of problems, but I had one potential solution: players have one big mothership, and although they can capture planets with their little ships, they can only control and give orders to the little ships that are in range of their mothership. Their mothership is kind of like a tank on [diep.io](https://diep.io), it can roam around slowly and it carries little ships like a planet does. All of that means that players won't have to do a lot of scrolling around the map, since they can only control whats on their screen, and they would have to move their mothership around to a planet in order to defend it. Planets could give ships, or they could give some other kinds of resources used to upgrade motherships. Motherships can do battle with each other as well, but motherships with more upgrades will always be a bit slower than newer, weaker motherships, so newer players should be able to escape unless cornered or trapped. \n\nI don't know, maybe this is a terrible idea! I just really loved solarmax 2 and thought if it could be made into a multiplayer IO game it could be a hit and really a lot of fun. Let me know what you think."

8jbc7t,Economic Simulation in a Fantasy 'RPG' Kingdom,"Sorry for the wall of text, just bear with me...\n\nA strategy ""business simulator"" set in a fantasy kingdom where you play as the mayor in charge of all the local businesses. What inspired this idea was an article I read a couple of years ago talking about in-game economics. If an adventurer is going around collecting spendable cash from enemy mobs, how does that affect the value of the currency? The more there is, the less its worth. The player would manage this kingdom with using a ""city builder"" interface, assigning jobs, building new structures, recruiting adventurers in an attempt to make a functioning kingdom. \n\nThe goal would be to give the player complete control and be punishing. You have control over all sales in this kingdom. Lets say you price bread too cheaply, lets say 20 gold. If it costs 15 to produce, your net profit is 5, but you haven't payed the people at the bakery yet! If the combined wages weekly is 5000 gold and you make 800 weekly bread sales, the bakery is losing 1000 gold each week. This goes deeper though, how do you get the materials for the bread? Wheat! Hows the wheat field doing for profit? Is it cheaper to just import the wheat than produce it? Now supply/demand is being taken into consideration.\n\nAs you can expect, peoples happiness will go down if there are being charged too much for things. That amount can vary… Is that person working? Whats their income? How much are they buying? If someone is too unhappy, they can leave. The less people living in your kingdom, the less people are working in your kingdom. However, the larger your kingdom is, the harder it is to manage. Your primary goal is to make a successful kingdom, not necessarily the biggest.\n\nThis kind of thing really appeals to the business nerd inside of me, and this could even prove to be educational as it would follow real-world economic mechanics. You wouldn't need prior knowledge of economics to play. My question is, does this sound fun? If there's anything that I can explain more clearly, please let me know. Really keen for some feedback on this one..."
8j9ylf,A Salt and Sanctuary style side-scrolling Zelda game where the protagonist is Linkle,"I know Linkle is supposed to be some sort of a one-off fan service character just to fill the character roster of The Hyrule Warriors, but I think there's a huge potential to make a compelling character.\n\nNot just because Linkle's basically a female Link, it's that she believes that she's the reincarnated hero and actively leaves her home to save Hyrule. Not accidental. Not because his sister or friend got kidnapped so he had no choice but to go adventure. She hears a news and voluntarily ventures. The thing is that we know she simply isn't the chosen one, but despite this, she saves the day. No legendary or mythical element was involved in this character arc. She was just a normal girl who wanted to save the world. The Hyrule Warriors played this off comically, but it could make a tragics story out of this.\n\nHere's my idea.\n\n- Story: It starts with what seems like a conventional Zelda story and we play as Link fighting Ganon to save Princess Zelda from the get-go. The twist is that the player cannot win Ganon. Ganon defeats Link. The hero is dead. The Hyrule Kingdom is doomed, the dark and horrifying atmosphere completely swallows the Kingdom. After the prologue, we see an ordinary village girl awakening and realizes Ganon's army just conquered the Hyrule. She has the legendary compass given by her grandmother, which led her to believe that she's the legendary hero. She had trained herself since then to become one. She renames herself as Linkle and leaves her village to save Hyrule.\n\n- Gameplay: The gameplay is a side-scroll action platformer that has never been done since Zelda 2 on NES. It follows Metrovania formula similar to modern indie titles such as Salt and Sanctuary and Hollow Knight. It's not open-world, but maps are interconnected and nonlinear to give a sense of exploration. The roleplaying systems like experience points and leveling are incorporated. The player can use diverse sets of weapons: sword, spear, lance, dual crossbows etc.\n\n- Visual: Since the story is set in the world where the hero is defeated and the villain won, the eternal night continues throughout the game similar to Souls games. The player always needs a lantern and fuel to travel deep down caves.\n"
8j9ad1,FNAF like game,"First off, I’d say this is too close to the actual FNAF games to be considered... legal? Copyright friendly? Whatever. If you have any ideas you’d like to add to help me... **not** get fined and/or jail time, let me know.\n\nAnyway, the premise is simple. You are the night guard at a studio producing the ever-popular television show, *Manimals.* *Manimals* is a show created by the legendary William Wray, a master in puppetry and robotics, comparable to Jim Henson, but not really because in this universe he **is** Jim Henson.\n*Manimals* is a long running show, seeing as how it was first aired in the 70’s, and the game takes place in the 90’s. It’s named as such seeing as how the animatronic puppets are of an innately animal design, yet dress, speak and act as humans.\n\n**I mean, fuck, at this point this outta just be the next FNAF.**\n\nAnywho, the show’s still running, and running strong. However, the studio is missing a night guard, and that’s where you come in! You see, the great William Wray was kind of a nutcase, and couldn’t bear to have anyone else around his precious creations alone at night. So he would work both a day **and** night shift, getting very little sleep... ever.\nThis affected his health greatly, and in 1991, he sadly passed away. However, he left in his will that your character (unnamed thus far), would take over his nightly duties.\n\nSo! With the plot out of the way, how does the game play? Much like its inspiration, rather simply. The big gimmick is that the character’s talk through and act out parts of that day’s script, even into the night. When they don’t receive a response, they begin to grow... uneasy. You are provided with a soundboard so you can continue the script until they stop or the night ends.\nNot exactly difficult, so maybe you guys could help me out coming up with ideas. And in case you aren’t convinced, I thought I’d share some of the dialogue I’ve come up with for William Wray...\n\n“Greetings, welcome to your first day on the job! My name’s William Wray, yes, **that** William Wray. You can thank me for my technological contributions later... oh wait, I’m dead! \nHa ha ha, got ya there, didn’t I!? No, probably not... you’d know I’m dead if you...\n(Ahem!)\nYes, as was detailed in my will, you’ve inherited... my job. Not very flattering, I know, but you’re... the only person I can trust with these characters. The younger people here don’t treat these characters with the respect they deserve. They hold a very special place in the hearts of many children, and you’re the only person I trust to understand that...\nAnd... there’s... there’s another reason too... I mean, you’re job doesn’t **just** entail scarring away horny teenagers with a flashlight. You see those buttons in front of you? Those are **very** important, don’t mess with ‘em.\nThe characters get kinda funky at night... to be honest, they get pretty funky in the daytime, too, but we’ve got hundreds of people here during the day.\nFor whatever reason, the characters will randomly start reciting their lines from that day’s script. Really weird, might be a glitch.\nNow, it’s never happened to me, but having one of those guys in your office might be... a little problematic. (Ahem!) That’s why we’ve got that fancy soundboard in front of you! Yeah, those pretty lights aren’t there for nothing. When one of the animatronics starts saying lines, you have those buttons to form your own sentences in response. Usually calms them down, some sort of factory reset or... or somethin’... 20 years later and we’re still ironing out these bugs...\nOh! But you do have to make sure the lines are **correct.** If you say the wrong thing, they kinda... freak out on ya... happened to me only once, made sure it never happened again.\nWell, that’s... about it, I believe. Just... breathe, don’t panic... relax, you got this!\nEnd tape.”\n\nYes, you are totally free to use that dialogue if you plan to use this idea as well. Or you could use it in your own projects! It may not make sense... at all, but it’s yours either way."
8j5vk6,CE Worlds NO.1,"the story design: In a time mankind reaches out the far deeps of cyberspace. In the world they are left behind the process of creating artifical intelligence is still in progress processed by automatic scripts writen from the last humans taken care about this or still believed in to achieving it. A special moment the automatic script completed the task and the true AI was born. After a time it started calculating into the cyberspace to meet the humans who assisting in creating it. Because of program mistakes (nobody thought about AI in cyberspace) it crashed into the humans cyberspace world and created an own. Now it producing little programs with special abilties and the quest to find a real human. This programs are the player.\n\nthe character design: every program start in the same design and stats, during the evolution of the program it is capable to change the role, appearance or applications. The program becomes stronger if it stays in the cs worlds and achieves challanges.\n\nthe amount if skins in the game defines the range of stories. But every player starts with skin No1, designed like a human puppet. They player can keep the skin and just leveling the stats or skills. You dont need XP for skins. But some skins support certain skills or boost certain stats with bonuses.\n\nstats and skills are bases on a formula to balance the game\n\nthe stats design: the stats will grow with the player exponentially in the progress. starting with the 3 stats for No1 program (offenCE, defenCE, intelligenCE) the players starting can choose one of it offence (take damage) defence (block damage) if taken intelligence (give life) to itself or others The stats will balance the game during the procedure of progression. You are not linked to your first status, you could use XP to level an other basic stat up. But you can also use your XP to gain skills and upgrades for your LP.\n\nthe skill design: skills you can obtain by xp, every skill is linked to a basic stat for new player could be the punch skill for offence the arm block for defence the movement skill for intelligence\n\nlater game could be offence skill fire dragon attack defence skill 1 min water barrier intelligence skill 10 sec invisible\n\nyou have a high amount of skills linkes to your stats, you can combine offence, defenence and intelligence skills based on your design to become No1 :) to find the humans ;)\n\nAt the beginning you have only 3 skill slots, when you lvl up you can obtain more. Passive skill slots included.\n\nSpecial is that you can also lvl your skills with XP, so you can obtain a No1 punch for example.\n\nThe skills are very much designed like everything suitable for the base stats (wapons, magic, crafting) skills can be boosted by skins\n\nthe LP design: have nothing special here for the moment, its a good idea to become stronger (or maybe not if this can be handy sometime whoahahaha) ..sorry\n\ncombat design: this is linked to the engine of the game. would be nice to have some live action in open world. but it could be also a good idea to open in every combat situation an area arround the player to keep performance up. the combat design I thought is simular to naruto fighting games well it offers first person view. Target lock and fast easy action.\n\nsome more design: - due to the CyberspacE setup the world offers a crazy amount of things to do and quests to find a true human - it would be great to have ingame employees taken care about the storyline, meta and balance!! - server are linked to game difficulty / harder server offers more XP to gain - you can build and craft (every npc drops an item you can only get with him) - the CyberspacE World has planets (round maps) and drifts/sharps (flat designed / like asgard) traveling with ships or mounts you can purchase, build or rent from map to map (i am not the teleporting fan..only for the skill tree)\n\nexample:\n\nplaying the find the skull dragon in quest with a lvl 10 No.1 Skin: Johnny 5 Stats: 30% offence - 25% defence - 45% intelligence Skills: 20% movement speed (passive) - offence skill crafting 10 little johnny 5 to create 0,25% damage per hit (cooldown 6sec) - offence skill punsh with 0,1 % damage per hit - defence skill ""i feel alive"" blocking 15% incoming damage quest achieves 0,038 % XP, a skull daragon skin and the possibility adding the bone dragon attack to his skill tree with the needed XP amount this is not a calculated example\n\nthe amount of content could be always higher and higher xD\n\nthank you for reading whould be nice to have some discusion\nabout that or if I could get some feedback or questions to ask\n\n"
8j5h89,A evo style creature game,"I want a raise your creature game like no other. I would love nothing more then to make it myself, but lol thats not gonna happen. I imagen a game set in the future where the latest trend is designer pets. Of course people get bored easy so many have taken to battling their creatures. I want a game where you start off with something like a puppy, you travel around gathering evo points ( some points can be used for thicker bones, armour plating, denser muscles, or just a ton of horns and teeth lol.) A game where you can edit your creature like spore, battle like pokemon and aquire evo points like digimon. Whats the chances something like that will ever happen?"
8j39zp,Am i the only one?,"If you've ever played TEW or EWR, you'll know what the gist of this is. Imagine if we had a fantasy simulation game \(like TEW/EWR\) that lets us control TV Broadcasters like FOX or Nickelodeon. I personally love this idea. Like, what if we could create new shows and cancel old ones? Maybe go a bit deeper and let us control what happens on the show? What about buying\-over other networks, Sell retired show rights, buy retired shows for a reboot? I'm probably the only one who wants a game like this, right?"
8j2jl8,Be that ancient legend,"Hi all!\n\nTL;DR section at the end of this text.\n\nSo... where should I begin?\nI think all of you know about the one thing you probably have in every RPG. You level up until you reach max level and then you start the gear spiral. Sooner or later, you'll encounter some big bad guys which wield, and in many cases drop, legendary parts of weapons or armor or whatever. But... Who made these weapons? Who made the armor? Even, who the hell invented and wrote down that damn spell you just used to roast these goblin's testicles? Some games and some books tell you where these things were made, but aside from the rings from Lord of the Rings (especially the One Ring) and the Sectum Sempra spell from Harry Potter (where it is at least strongly pointed out that it was invented by Severus Snape, who refers to it being his spell), in nearly all cases these legendary and powerful items and spells seem to be originating from the ""good old days"". For me, this is kind of unsatisfying. Hey, I levelled up my smithing and enchanting skills, learned everything there is to know from the masters of these arts in this realm and everything I can do is a grinding stone to sharpen a self-made axe which isn't half as good as this aeons old thing this double-headed Minotaurus-Demon has carried around for ages? Yeah... great... for my part, I only know one game where endgame armor and weapons are at least partly crafted (Anarchy Online if someone wants to know). So what I thought about is this...\n\nThink about a Diablo-esque game, wide areas, dungeons, whatever. You're a going-to-be legend in your art, but you're not quite there yet. You level up by fighting to collect raw materials (you know, these powerful, earth-shattering spells are way too much to be written on paper, it would burn instantly, but that patch of demon skin, which sadly is still on that demon over there, that should work quite well...) and by crafting and inventing. While your character level goes up, so does your power to use different and more dangerous materials and techniques. While your crafting/inventing skill goes up, you can add more effects and specials to your creations.\n\nSo the thing is... let's say you've chosen some barbarian class. You start with some basic combat skills, like swing that axe from above your head down, say, a chop move. While this works nicely for goblins and alike, it won't do much to this lizardman with that massive boneplates on his forehead. But hey, his sides seem to be unprotected... so you go back to your home and look at the skill tree with its different branches. There's a section for armed and unarmed moves, a section for effects to put on items, a section with different spell components and effects, etc. Now you have the choice. Put a magical effect on that axe which counters the lizardmans boneplate, for example some lightning, or go the more axe-technique way and develop an axe swing to hit his sides?\n\nAnd that's the starting point. You don't rely on a teacher to show you how it's done, you create your own weapons, your own spells, your own fighting techniques, your own armor. Later on, that axe swing could turn into a whirlwind move with AoE damage and some resistance to ranged attacks due to the wind it causes, which can, indeed, be adjusted by yourself. Make that move slower to add more force and control to it, therefore inflicting more damage while you sacrifice that ranged resistance part. Make it faster, so that resistance goes up, but that whirlwind state won't last as long. Make it hit hard and be fast as hell and last for 5 seconds... while it consumes most of your stamina at once.\nMake that lightning axe cast a cone of lightning when it hits a target, inflicting damage to everything within 5m in a 45° angle. Make that angle smaller, so it hits for 10m. Let it cast thunder on 25% of all hits which stunns every enemy in a 10m circle around you or let it be on 75% of all hits, but the stun won't last as long or only affect everything within 4m. It's your choice.\n\nLet that kick do fire damage, causing damage over time. Or let it cause an explosion with knockback and AoE damage. Or do a stun on the enemy, teleport you behind him, maybe facing the enemy for an attack in the back, or facing away for him to let you escape.\nLet that frostnova return to you to form an ice shield. Have that heal-over-time spell do damage to enemies which hit you while it lasts.\nCraft armor which doesn't protect you that good, but it heals you a little bit when you're hit. Say ""wow... nice... but it doesn't amplify fire attacks... *a little bit of crafting* well, now it does"".\n\nThe thing is, you just get some basic patterns, like moves, or spells, you combine them, reorder them (for combos etc), add additional effects, basically make your own  skills to use, items and therefore even classes. The more powerful the item or move, the better ingredients you need. Better sheets to write spells on, better smithing materials, higher chi energy for martial arts moves, better food or something for weapon moves.\n\nSo far, it sounds a little bit like Monster Hunter, but I think it goes further. Just imagine how all these powerful items get into the hands of these raid groups (NPCs!)? Will you be the big bad guy who gets attacked by them for that nice sword and armor you created? Or will you just be the guy who sells that stuff to the big bad guys? And... what happens when you die while on the hunt for new materials? Will somehow your kickass bow end up in the hands of the bad guy because he looted you? Yes, I think it should also be possible that something of your gear is missing when you respawn. And if you don't like farming all that lower tier crafting stuff you need for that new wonder you're going to create... set up a quest for the raid groups or single adventurers to bring it to you. The reward is one of your creations...\n\nSo what do you think of that idea?\n\nTL;DR:\nDiablo-esque game about crafting and creating the things you use to fight stuff. Lots of customization. Kill monsters and bosses for crafting materials or make NPCs do so. If you, or an NPC dies, there's a chance some gear stays on the enemy or he has learned one of your spells or martial arts moves. Be the guy who made these legendaries which drop from the boss your WoW raid group tried for weeks to kill. Be that ancient guy who invented that spell which your class teacher just took your first born son (in english: 25 silver pieces) for.\n\nTheSedated"
8ivxfu,Game where you start at the end.,"When i was younger i always found it cool to see old save files in cartridges or memory sticks and see what others have left behind, especially pokemon and animal corssing games.\n\nWhy not have this as a gimmick of a final fantasy like rpg?\n\nYou begin the game with only the options to load, continue a game and settings. When loading the save file you appear in the final boss room just before you fight them. You fight the main boss, get the ending and the credits roll, you'll start the post game right after the credits and essentially begin your game with the big bad already defeated.\n\nThis is where your initial game begins, seeing the aftermath of these characters decisions and actions and piecing together what happened.\n\nYour party will be max level, all skills, best equipment, etc. So fights will be no challenge to you essentially skippable and your level but this all will also serve as your tutorial in the grand scale.\n\nWhen you have finished the postgame the new game will finally unlock allowing you to be introduced to these characters and maybe changing some choices that you have seen the results off."

8iu0ma,Point Blank,"So I was thinking of the idea of another battle royale game but with the theme of 60's TV, like Cuphead. This game wouldn't be a copy of Cuphead, Fortnite or PUBG. It should be a hard game, so no building,  a maximum amount of weapons, which is two, and no driving. \n\nThe game would play in a third-person-view, including the guns - except for the snipers. You would use a zoom for those. Fire rates would be slow and guns would be reasonably powerful, with sniper rifles, revolvers and shotguns being the most powerful.

8h3md2,Polaria,"TL;DR: a game in a similar to vein as Journey or Abzū, with some Metroid-esque qualities, and some survival  elements thrown in. There’s no dialogue, it’s highly stylized graphics are meant to convey a feeling of loneliness and isolation. You are a genius engineer who’s crash landed in an iron sand desert, you’ve repaired an old Magna-Skiff and you’re trying to find a way out of the desert. The entire time the main character seems to have a plan, that you the player aren’t privy to, as you wander you find ruins that contain technology you need to upgrade the ship. Once all the pieces are gathered the hero’s plan is revealed, the skiff takes off into the air turning into a sky ship, and that’s when the credits roll.\n\n\nFirst off, art style. The sand would be rendered rather realistically, other than that everything has a smooth cartoonish texture to it. The skiff resembles a fishing boat mixed with one of those electric hover ships from the Matrix, at first. Electricity, fire, and rain (and sand I guess) would really be the only particle effects in the game, you are all alone so the only real danger is the elements and a lack of foresight. The sky needs to contrast well with the dark sands, starting off as a vibrant blue then shifting throughout the day cycle to a more violet color. The Night is pitch black, aside from the very faint moonlight, which is why you’ll probably want to find bulbs for the skiff’s spotlight first.\n\nSpeaking of, the whole point of the game is to find ruins that will have parts to add onto your skiff that make navigation easier/more fun. The thing is though you won’t just be pressing X to add spotlights, every piece of tech will have a mini game of sorts that entails you incorporating it onto the skiff, you actually rotate the right stick as your character screws in the bulbs and you find only one of them actually turns on, now you don’t have to but you could access the electrical systems, put the wires in their proper places and get all the lights working again, or you could just make do with the one and be done with it. You’ll find parts that need to be welded, chemicals to mix and carefully pour, and dangerously heavy parts that fall sometime and initiate a quick time event where if you fail you are crushed. \n\nThe beginning of the game in fact has you dragging pieces of metal that fell off back to the skiff and you need to then weld them into place, and hot wire the engine, all facilitated through mini-games, i.e. tracing carefully with the welding torch, matching the right color wires, tapping A/X then B/O  to avoid squishing ,things like that. Once you do that you’ve got your skiff. You control the skiff from the helm that operates much like a boat’s, the camera pulls out a ways to give a clear view of the ship, you can always choose between first and third person camera, even when at the helm. Leaving the helm does not bring the skiff to a stop, you can actually just set off in a direction, leave the thrust on and do things that need doing around and in the skiff while you head towards new ruins.\n\nNavigation is an integral part of the game, you’ll be hovering around the desert so control of the skiff needs to be smooth and fun. Imagine if an F-zero racer was bigger and controlled more like a ship from Assassin’s Creed IV, but you’ve still got that sliding strafe action. There’s a boost of course so you can hurl the skiff over a dune and enjoy as you gently glide back down to hovering altitude. It’s not all sunshine and massive jumps though. When it rains, it pours, and I mean to say whenever it’s raining a storm is going on. Huge bolts of red lightning will strike the sand and send magnetic waves out that knock your ship around, as your ship takes damage systems that you’ve upgraded will need to be attended to when the storm settles. You may need to re-weld, or find more bulbs to replace broken ones. There’s separate health bars for all these systems, when those are all broken you get down to your last health bar and if that goes down your ship breaks and you lose. There is an upgrade that enables you to hunker down in the middle of a storm, allowing you to do repairs without worrying about having to fix something else immediately after you’ve fixed the original problem.\n\nThere are 12 upgrades total, but you only need 7 to finish the game, only one of which is actually necessary, as in you can’t start the final upgrade process until you get it, it is always the 7th piece of technology you find. The ruins are procedural, every play through will have slightly different looking ruins in different places with different things inside. Maybe you find bulbs after you’ve already got the spotlights working, you can leave them or take them and store them on the skiff for when the next storm hits. There’s limited space on the skiff so pick wisely what you think is necessary to carry spares of. \n\n\nMusic should be somewhat sparse, ambient if anything, maybe some intense electronic strings for the storms, but other than that it’s just dreary chip tuney kind of stuff that sounds like a spaghetti western, but not the exciting gun battle parts, more like the stuff that plays during the beginning establishing shots. There are pretty decent swaths of gameplay that just contain the sound of your ship’s humming and the wind. \n\nThe Ruins are the only part of the game that allows you to actually leave the ship, you’ll do some basic platforming to get at the parts you need, but other than that there’s not much to learn about or do in the ruins. The game isn’t about learning why the desert is there, or really anything about the world.

Failing missions is an option, losing your team is not.\n\nDuring combat you would not only have to kill the opposition but also monitor your squads status without an HUD support.\n\nListen for allies calls.\n\nWhen you locate an injured ally, decide if the area is safe to give him attention. \n\nLocate the wound. Is he worth trying to save? Is he dead already because you were to slow?\n\nIs he actually hit or scared? Was it a graze?\n\nApply what you learn to stop the bleeding and keep him alive.\n\nDo not get killed while administering help, listen to your allies and the gun shots to know how close the enemy soldiers and armor are. Take cover when hearing enemy shells.\n\nI picture the era being similar to WW2."
8gzjpy,Battlefield meets Civilization,"I’d love to see a game where politics and war collide. You can choose whether to be a diplomat, a frontline soldier or a war dog or a war veteran and each play style controls a completely different aspect of gameplay.\n\nThe diplomat would be in charge of the politics of the war, working towards different trade deals and maintaining alliances with other diplomats. As you increase in leadership your decisions would affect whether you become a peaceful leader or a despot. The longer your country stays in peace the more experience you earn.\n\nThe war dogs would be in charge of smuggling guns to the front line soldiers. \n\nThe frontline soldier would handle the actual fight. Using the guns secured by the diplomats and war dogs. You don’t level up guns instead you fight for supplies on the ground. \n\nAnd the war veterans would be in charge of deciding what countries to invade depending on the size of the army and the supplies/trade relations and alliances held.\n\nThe idea being that the games political climate, gun supplies, frontline battle and strategies are all organised by the players.\n\n\n"

8gyewg,Simple 2D Mobile Phone Game Idea,"You have ball. You tilt your phone to the left. The world rotates anticlockwise and the ball moves to the left. Tilt to the right, the world rotates clockwise and the ball moves to the right. The world will scroll as you move. Tapping on the screen makes the ball jump. Jump height is determined by how long you hold down on the screen.\n\nChallenge would come from needing momentum to move up ramps and having to jumping over obstacles. Also there would be series of collectables in each level. If you collect them all you get a reward. "
8gxxzn,A 3rd Person RPG shooter where you choose 3 robots/drones to accompany you with their own unique guns and different uses.,"Keep in mind: the inspiration was Klanx of Heroes of Newerth\n\n\nThe game is set on a mech-punk world and revolves around a character that creates small robots, both ground and flying, and employing 3 of them in every mission. Each robots have diffrent guns and different environment use.\n\nThematicaly, the robots doesnt have AI on them, Its just that the character loves his creations so much he feels like they are alive (He lil bit crazy). The robots uses tracking mechanism on him so the robots follow him, and shoots whoever he shoots but in a kinda sloppy manner. He also controls the robot via remote from time to time.\nHe may also pick up the robots and shoot them manually.\n\nI imagined his robots to be not humanoid in form but more like guns-on-wheels. They are low and and mounted with a gun or other upgrade stuff.\n\nHis robots and its uses:\n\nHis basic trio:\n*Forrest*\n-Has sniper riffle\n-Has flamethrower\n-Uses Gas\n\n*Helios*\n-Hellicopter drone that he can use as lift \n-Has machine gun\n\n*Bazook*\n-Has a rocket launcher\n-Heavy, he cannot carry as a gun.\n-Can leave land mines\n\nOther robots unlocked by collecting parts\n\n*Juggler*\n-Tall robot. Has sphere ball as wheels\n-He can draw 3 rotating saws from his body. Rotating around him.\n-His gun is also mounted around him and also rotates.\n-Good if surrounded by enemies (be sure u are hidden)\n\n*Betazzle*\n-Super strong taser\n\n*Fisher*\n-Crossbows\n-Can cast net\n\n*Sweet tooth*\n-Drill\n-Has a Double barrel shotgun\n\n*Mob*\n-Basic gun is Ak 47\n-Can be mounted with most generic guns from killed enemies\n-Can use scattered magazine\n\n*Yeti*\n-Is a hydraulic jack\n-Have heavy tools like wrench\n-Convenient hammer on wheels\n\n*Kidd*\n-Can be used as a glidder (Alternative from flying)\n-Or a skateboard \n-Has a handgun/minigun\n(Good traversing robot, weak offense)\n\n*Cross*\n-Gunblade on wheels\n-Effective against robots who doesnt die on bullets\n\nMy ideas on the ff robots are still rough:\n*Kaleido* (?)\n-Has an industrial light for caving\n-Silencer gun\n\n*Anchor* (?)\n-Has chains (for whatever purpose it may serve)\n-Can be used as pick axe for caving\n\nRobots can be picked up (with exception to juggler) \n-to hit the target you want to hit because robots kinda shoot sloppy and on random enemies. \n-Also sometimes you want/need to use their guns.\n\nThey can also be controlled via remote. This makes your character imobile.\n*Example:*\nBazook's laying land mines.\n\n\nAs you can see each robot has an environmental use and part of the game is unlocking puzzles/places/story using these. \n*Example:*\nA whole control pannel has to be short-circuited by betazzle and dismantled by Yeti's tools. Both are weak offensively.\n\nEither you go with both and risk having weak arsenal or go back two times with one each.\n\nThese is an exploration game with a lot of going back from place to place. Its on the player to predict which robot would be used for ceratin places/stages. If you don't have the right robots you may go back to get them but the enemies are respawned.\n\nThings found around:\n-Gas\n-Battery\n-Bullets\n-Upgrade parts (like mountable flash light)\n-Completing mountable parts/Some useless parts unlocks a robot\n\nTwo types of robots via the energy source:\n-Gas robots can be boosted by nitrous.\n-Battery robots can be mounted with upgrades\n\n\n\n\nRough idea its like:\nTenchu levels/Darksouls/Exploration/Steampunk/Mechanical\n\n\n*If you are interested on the story from my head so far*:\nThe story is about a character who is bad at aiming but loves his guns and has really good but lonely heart. \n\nDue to his bad aiming capability, he invented a mechanism on the riffle so that it adjusts its nozzle to hit the target better.\n-He added flamethrower\n-then he added wheels because flamethrower and gas is heavy\n-He used this mechanism to make it follow him\n-Next thing he knows he got one lovable pet that radiates his love of guns\n\nAnd that was his first robot. He created more and was so passionate about it that he thinks they are alive.\n\nNote: I wanted the robots to not have AI because it is a mech-world setting. Also the love of inanimate objects is relatable, brings more depth to the story, and gives more personality to the character"

8gu94e,How about a game that your actions create a song?,Each level of the game (song) would be a chord made up of a group of possible actions or enemies (notes). So each level (chord) could be played multiple different ways to create a song unique to each play through.  Imagine slaying enemies to create a metal symphony with a boss as being some sort of crazy guitar solo. (🤟)There could be multiple endings to each level leading to different chord progressions through the game. Darker pathways could create something sounding sinister with redemption pathways to crawl back towards a more melodic feel. It would be cool to be able to listen to your song when the credits roll. \n\n Please send me 25% of all proceeds 😂

As you progress through the game the game gets harder, making it easier for you to die but you also get to do cool things like fly planes and be a sniper but. At the end of the game you fight the most bad guys but get shot by wife, who was actually bad guy all along and still alive. She is about to shoot you when friend sacrifises him self to save you then you have quicktime event and press buttons and kill her. I was also thinking of a multiplayer mode where you can fight other people also mayeb zombie survival thanks for listening."

8ggz0x,Pokemon (or not) arena battles with interactive environment,"Disclaimer: the game CAN be made without infringing on the Pokemon brand, if a licence is too costly to obtain - just change the names and creature designs. This can even be a ""plan B"" - design it with alternative names, then seek to obtain the licence when you already have something to show (thus they are more likely to work with you). Even if you fail to obtain the rights to the Pokemon name, the game will still be good enough in its own right.\n\nThis one is inspired by Pokemon battles in the Pokemon anime. Unlike in the actual Pokemon games, the battles there were a lot more creative. Especially ones that involved the use of the battlefield itself - like shooting a flamethrower at an ice battlefield would result in a pond; using watergun on a ground battlefield would produce slippery mud; DIGgging many tunnels would collapse some part of the battlefield and trip up charge-type attacks/rollout; etc. There are many possible interactions and thus a wide array of strategies that can be employed by the players (however I don't know how difficult it would be to balance the game).\n\nThe gameplay would take you to the first-person view of the pokemon you're controlling, with up to 4 different attacks available, along with movement. Obviously, you need to take down your opponent(s).\n\nIn actual Pokemon games there are 18 different types and hundreds of moves - implementing ALL of that at once would put this on par with AAA games (at least cost-wise), but the beauty is that this could be implemented gradually as well, raising money along the way. And, of course, some attacks would simply be impossible to use in this format so that cuts down some of the work (not that you even NEED to implement ALL of them). Gradual implementation would also mean that players could keep coming back to the game to see all the new stuff going on."
8ggw87,Co-op starship game with different roles,"I'm thinking up a game for a text-only starship space exploration game. Each player would take control of one station/sub-sysyem of the ship, giving them a unique role. They can chat with other players, and can enter commands into their unique console to activate certain subsystems of the ship, or pull up information. I hope this would encourage communication and cooperation.\n\nRoles I've come up with so far:\n\n* Captain - views a dashboard of everything, communicate in/outside the ship, selects the mission/quest\n* Power Engineer - view inputs/outputs, can designate power for certain subsystems\n* Pilot/Navigator - initiate jumps, control engines and direction, basic scanning, deep scanning, jump course plotting\n* Science/Comm - hail, open comm channels, scanning system objects, decrypting signals, send science data, analyzing systems, analyzing planets, ships, etc.\n* Geologist / Mining Engineer - deploy mining drones, refine ore, transport crystals\n* Leaving out weapons/shields to keep it peaceful for now, but that could be an interesting thing to add later.\n\nWhat are some other roles you can think of?\n\nAnd what are some missions and goals that a starship could have as they warp around the galaxy?"

8ge97v,"“The Guy In The Chair” - a game where you play as the hero’s “guy in the chair”, bringing up information, schematics, coordinates, hack security systems, disable power grids, etc on the fly as your heroic counterpart fights the big bad.","You work for a sort of superhero call-center that provides as-needed support to the various super heroes of the world. As a hero calls in with needs, such as “I put a tracker on this guy and I need to know where he’s going!”, or “I need the security system shut down”, or “I need the schematics of a nuclear bomb”, you would access the various modules to gather that information.\n\nFor the tracker scenario, you’d need to triangulate the location of the tracker by pinging it off of cell towers (GPS is too busy to single out a single tracker). \n\nFor the security system scenario, you’d need to run a hacking routine to crack the firewall and then override the system.\n\nFor the nuke scenario, you’d need to look through the database for the serial number and determine the correct wiring schematics or override code to disable the bomb.\n\nThe interface would be reminiscent of “Papers Please”, and the game play a strange mash up of “Papers Please” and “Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes”.\n\nYou would be sitting at your command center as the calls come through. You answer them one at a time. When you accept a call, the directions come through clearly. “This is SuperDuperDude, I need operational instructions for a Blackhawk Helicopter”. “Hold please”. You’d have a set amount of time to find and send the instructions to SuperDuperDude before he is gruesomely destroyed by his foes. You can hear him fighting and straining in the back ground with the struggle becoming increasingly intense as time goes on until you either help them or their die awfully.\n\nThere would be all sorts of different tasks. Accessing the big bad’s Facespace profile to dig up personal info that the hero can use to beat him down psychologically, hacking the traffic grid to give your hero green lights, even trapping the bad guy with a series of magnetically sealed doors. A while great many options of mini games to play at the behest of your superhero client.\n\nAll from the comfort of your chair.\n"
8gdwxu,Your not so standard Mobile infinite runner.,"**Name**\n\n* Business Dash. I'm not really interested in the game name all that much.\n\n**Concept Overview**\n\n* This is an infinite runner with a bit more depth to keep people coming back.\n\n**Plot**\n\n* This is not a plot-driven game. I suppose Being the most lucrative business would be the goal. \n\n**Setting**\n\n* This game takes place in the city.\n\n**Charactes/Abilities**\n\n* The player can choose a male or female character. \n\n* Players can buy a limited amount of ""Stat Points"" that allow the player to distribute them into different stats like ""Run Speed"" ""Health"" and ""Stamina."" \n\n* Other abilities players could purchase could be stuff like ""GPS"" ""Sprint"" and ""Magnet"" could also have a level-up purchase.\n\n* Stat points and Abilities can be purchased with Both in-game currency and a paid currency. This would give an initial bonus to paid players but in the long run, would not matter.\n\n* Other paid currency purchases would be cosmetic only purchases or perhaps early access to new maps.\n\n**Gameplay Mechanics**\n\n* Swipe up to jump, down to slide, left to go left one space, right to go right one space. Standard Infinite runner controls.\n\n* A big in-game map would need to be created. Different portions of the map will be harder than others. Players would be able to buy businesses on the map and hire other players to run deliveries. Businesses are ""Start"" points where a player will do a delivery from.\n\n* The running itself would be from point A to point B and the obstacles between the two places would be random except for the street turns players would need to make. Maybe make them run back if they want a bonus.\n\n* Players complete runs and get the majority of the cash and the Business owner gets a cut. To make this easier a Business could be treated as a Guild where you can have officers that can make a small portion of the money from every delivery as well as getting a bigger cut from their own runs.\n\n* Rewards for the first Business to Spread to Each area. That way the people most dedicated Businesses are forever remembered as being the first in that area.\n\n* Very limited slots for businesses, however as the businesses in the area grow more business slots pop up. In the higher difficulty areas, business slots pop up slower.\n\n*Businesses will only be purchasable with in-game money and not paid currency.

8gdg8t,2.5D Creepy Mansion Game With Lighting As A Core Mechanic,"I had a vision of a game while I was half way between being contentious and asleep. I had to log on here to describe it before the image vanished from my mind. \n\nThe perspective was similar to something like Castlevania but zoomed out and you had some level of control over your depth (minimal and grid based). The mansion was also huge, I saw about 6 floors though it could be much bigger and everything was pitch black except for what was being lit.\n\nThe player character (adult male, well dressed, slim/average build) had a lantern which lit everything within about a 10 yard radius and beyond that darkness. They also had flashlight which would light a much longer distance but left everything behind you in total darkness. There was the occasional other light source such as open fires, mirrors and windows relieving a moonlit night and I saw a flash of lightening which lit the room for a split second. \n\nThere were also unlit chandeliers which I presume could be lit eventually though I never saw how.\n\nThe character also had a very limited capacity for running, jumping and climbing which left me feeling extremely vulnerable as the player. \n\nSound also played a crucial role. You could hear footsteps which differed depending on the surface and at one point I heard what could have been someone trying to quickly saw through bone for about 10 seconds, stopping for a few seconds then continuing (a long enough pause for them to check if the coast was clear).\n\nThat's all the important details I saw/heard. I don't know any of the other mechanics, whether it was a survival horror, mystery, rouge-like or if there are any supernatural elements to the game. Would be interesting to hear ideas for what this game could become. I might do something with this in the future but if anyone wants to take this idea and run with it be my guest."
8gdd2n,I need a theme for a game where you an Turn based game where you can only use a gun until it runs out of bullets.,"This game would have you using guns as weapons and You can use them a certain number of turns at any time until they run out of bullets, then they are gone. Guns can be found all around and you can earn them after fights. Got any themes or ideas for it?"
8gd2xx,Top Down Competitive Shooter.,"Ok, so I initially had this idea for a unique form of map building that i was planning on using in an RPG Rougelike. And I did some testing and it didn't quite fit with the fast paced gameplay of Rougelikes. \n\nSo I decided to turn the map building into a different genre.\n\nSo the idea is simply:\n- You start with a blank canvas with a starting room and another starting room\n- Each player is then given a chose of 3 different tile sets (similar to Tetris pieces but more variation and bigger pieces)\n- The player selects a piece and places it down and the other player does the same thing\n- The mini game ends once there is a path between both starting rooms\n\nBoth players are then spawned in and then it is a battle for objectives and kills for who will win. The rooms that the players placed can have different cover and like different objectives to gain an advantage over the other player. So this adds another way apart from just aim and reaction for players to out smart and beat their opponent. "
8gbyvi,My Fire Emblem game idea,"I've read the Witcher novel The Lady of the Lake, the final book of the Witcher saga, and there's a very interesting storytelling method where the book frames its Geralt and Ciri's story like it's a legend, with many different interpretations and point of views. One of the chapters set in the far future, and we follow two sorceresses trying to research the legend, which is Geralt's journey. There are many different versions of it so we don't know the fact on what exactly happened to them, just interpretations. Kind of like The Romance of Three Kingdoms and King Authur. They are indeed histories, but they were distorted to suit centuries of many storytellers' need so we never know how accurate they are.\n\nSince the continuity of Fire Emblem games has been... let's say it's just as straightforward as Zelda canon, I think this type of ""legend"" view would work for the series. For example, the basic story of Fates did happen, but we never know how accurate it is as it was depicted in the game. We never know whether Corrin was a historical figure or a fantasy. This style of storytelling would explain all the inconsistencies and ambiguity in the Fire Emblem lore.\n\nHere's my idea: the story set thousands of years from any Fire Emblem game. We never know when the story of this game takes place. The player follows the archaeologist, the historian, theologian analyzing the past historical events, which were represented by the games in the series. We play the aftermaths of Fates, Echoes, Awakening, and levels and story change as the narrators debate like Call of Juarez: Gunslinger."
8g9cm6,A Game where you can't jump and if you stop moving you will die.,"This is a REALLY old game idea I just came back to randomly (I'm probably going to get down-voted but,""Eh what can you do?"")\n\nThis game by no means has story,other than the fact You get to play as the 3 protagonist in the game (Not going into detail about who they are,just know that they can't use their legs) who are forced to complete numerous challenges to  progress to the next stage\n\nPlayers will use strategic methods,physics,or just pure luck to complete the stage\n "
8g5r37,2D platform Beat Em Up Game,"I was thinking of making a game where\nPlayers will choose amongst The Crips/Bloods/Police (Does not matter they are all equal) in which their only objective is to fight To win using weapons found scattered in the arena (Or the stage does not matter)\n\nThis is a IDEA for a game I do not expect this to be the FULL game,just something I'd like to keep in mind.\n\n(Their was a currency system I was thinking about implementing where you would get money for your performance in ""Story mode"",where you can buy weapons to use throughout the game)"
8g5ojl,A boss rush game where you can fight any boss in any order but they scale to your progress.,"The objective of the game is to defeat all the Champions of the Elements (Bosses) scattered about the map. You can challenge any Champion in any order you wish. There are no levels leading up to them, no puzzles to solve, no prerequisite of any kind. All you have to do is walk into their arena and the battle starts.\n\nI imagine this would be kinda like Shadow of the Colossus in that the whole game is nothing but boss fights. And the game would be hard. Like Dark Souls levels of brutally hard (I know Dark Souls is not necessarily ""brutally hard"" I just needed a comparison).\n\nNow in the title of this post I said the bosses scale based on your progress. This is true. The more Champions you defeat the stronger all the rest become.\n\nAt first you might notice they hit a little harder, cover a little more ground when they dodge your attacks. But then you realise that Area of Effect attacks are a little bigger, their melee attacks are quite a bit faster. After a while they start using new moves, moves they wouldn't use if you had come here sooner. Did the Champion of Nature always inflict poison? Didn't the Champion of Water stay on land more often than this? Since when can the Champion of Fire cause a smokescreen? By the time you reach the last few Champions you may as well be fighting someone entirely different than if you had fought them first.\n\nStraight from the start you have all the weapons you will have for the entire game. Some ideas I had were the following:\n\nKnife: Low damage. Highest attack speed. Shortest range of melee weapons.\n\nSword: Average damage. Average attack speed. Normal range.\n\nWar Hammer: High Damage. Slowest attack speed. Normal range.\n\nSpear: Less damage than sword but more than knife. Faster attack speed than war hammer but slower than sword. Has longest range than other melee weapons.\n\nBlow Dart: Fast reload time. Low damage.\n\nBow: Normal reload time. Normal damage.\n\nCrossbow: Slow reload time. High Damage.\n\nYou would also have a shield that can be used to block attacks.\n\nYou can only use one melee and one ranged weapon at a time. There are camps outside of all arenas that you can use to switch what you have. Some Champions are easier to defeat with a spear. Others are easier with a knife. Finding the right weapons to win is part of the challenge. Of course any Champion can be defeated with any weapon.\n\nThere is also an upgrade system. If you beat a Champion you get a Token. For example the Fire Token can be put on your Crossbow to make the bolts explode or be put on your spear to make it shoot a small beam of fire at things. Tokens can be removed and equipped from any camp. Want to try the Water Token on your Blow Dart? Just take off the Lightning Token and try it out.\n\nElemental Damage is not a thing. The Champion of Fire does not take more damage from a weapon with the Water Token. Defeating a Champion comes down (mostly) to skill. Are some Champions easier to defeat if you have a Token from another Champion? Yes. But it would still be largely skill based.\n\nSo what do you think? Anything you would change? Any good ideas for Champions? I would love to hear your thoughts on this."

8g3zai,A game that shows the perspective of the friends/family of someone who has taken their life.,"The game would be scripted, but would have multiple endings. It would be a text game, sort of like the undertale and pokemon games. It would start with you, the character, finding out that your friend/cousin/family member has taken their life. It would go through the stages of grief and show how someone close to you would be affected by another family member or close friend taking their own life.\n\nAs someone who's been through this multiple times, and has considered suicide myself, I feel it would be a powerful way to show how suicide can affect different people."

8fxvuq,Need Name + GFX Ideas for my 3D Puzzler,"I'm working on a mobile game that could be considered a carbon-copy of KOKOROMI's VR-exclusive ""SUPERHYPERCUBE"".  I'm really not digging the name that I have right now, which is ""3DoF"" (three degrees of freedom (yaw, pitch, roll)) so I'd like some name ideas if you have any.  My version of the game is also very bland.  The only things on screen most of the time are the score board, the cluster, and the wall, so I'd also like some ideas for visual effects.\nHere's what my game looks like (as of April 30th, 2018):\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtEB9dZ7yIA&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;ab_channel=ryanslikesocool\nRight now there's only a #1E1D24 solid color skybox (#000 if on iPhone X)."

8fwe2t,You Like Meta In A Game? So Do I. An Indie Game Idea,"So I know I’m not supposed to create a wall of text for this but let’s see if that’s possible or not. Here we go:\nThe game is a story-based adventure that is mostly about repayable content, and of course, the meta that comes with it. You control a faceless, cloaked protagonist carrying around an urn filled with the ashes of their friend (I’m calling them Urn Kid for now). The point of the game is to get Urn Kid to a place to spread the ashes and learn more about them and the person in the urn that way. The hitch is that based on your actions (original I know) Urn Kid may or may be aware of you, that something is controlling them. \nStory gameplay is based on meters, like a dating game. The awareness meter will go up when you go against Urn Kid’s wishes, do/say something they wouldn’t do, or encounter certain people, meaning their more aware they’re being controlled by an outside source. With that their Will meter will go up, which is their ability to resist your actions. Urn Kid is aware of and can remember when they die in-game, and getting them killed often is a way to lower their Will Meter. Different ending and information are available based on if you work against Urn Kid, with them, or have them not notice you influence at all.\nThe battle style is RTS. There are no levels, equipping items, or other RPG elements other than the skills Urn Kid starts with. Combat is based on dodging, finding weaknesses to attack or fleeing. The idea is that Urn Kid would not be able to battle at all without your help and your meta-knowledge, being able to come back from the dead with more knowledge about your enemies weakness, or knowing when to run rather than good items or high levels, though battle will be action-packed. This also means how the story goes is based on how good you are in battle, since getting Urn Kid killed changes the story.\n\nEstimated pricing for this project is $34,944- $146,765 based on cost calculator.\n\nTo help get an idea for the game here are inspirations for it: Journey (Character design/movement/art), Mass Effect (dialogue options/karma meter), Dark Souls (combat), earlier Final Fantasy games (setting), Undertale/Doki Doki Literature Club (meta ideas), Shovel Knight (expected level of graphics), Earthbound/Zelda: Ocarina of Time/Undertale (soundtrack)\nThe reason I’m not just making the game myself: I’m genuinely bad at coding. And even at my level, I realize this game would be a pain to code.\nMy skill set, so I don’t get booted out of development (in the highly unlikely chance this ever get’s that far): Amateur writer, so, I can write a story, dialogue, characters and setting stuff. I can probably help with graphics and design once I learn how. I’m business savvy so I can help run things, gather finances, sort those finances, do marketing stuff and make sure it doesn’t get stuck in development hell.\n\nI failed on the wall of text thing. My apologies.\n"
8isa33,Creek 2d Platformer,"I recently came up with an idea for a side-scrolling 2d platformer game. You are a tiny human for some reason and you are trying to go upstream a creek infested with angry animals, plants, and other obstacles. There are levels that have unique enemies and obstacles, and at the end of each level there is a boss. These bosses are giant and more powerful versions of regular enemies.\n \nYour weapon is a ""pebble gun"" that shoots, you guessed it, pebbles. It shoots one at a time in a medium rate of fire at a medium range, and does medium damage.\n\nTouching water won't damage or kill you. Instead, it will carry you back until you jump out of the water or hit an obstacle. There also might be enemies in in the water, so watch out! The water flows faster than you swim, so you can't just swim to the end of the level. There are some areas of pooling and slow water though.\n\nEach level at least a little different than the last. For example, there could be a level with clean, healthy creeks full of animals that are sensitive to pollution. Other levels could have lots of pollution and full of animals that are tolerant to pollution, like leeches or aquatic worms.\n\nObstacles and platforms could include:\n\nWater lilies that you can jump on, but if your jump onto the edge instead of the middle, it flips over.\n\nRain that splashes the water in the creek that could push away water lilies or enemies.\n\nFalling trees and tree branches that will really hurt you and cause a big splash.\n\nLeaves falling from trees that are smaller than water lilies but don't turn over.\n\nSmall or massive waterfalls. If it's very small, it isn't too much of a problem. But if it is a lot bigger, like a foot or two tall (remember you are about the size of a small frog) you will have to fall rock to rock to avoid taking damage.\n\nLarge rocks that you have to jump or climb over.\n\nAnd I could go on and on, but that's just a few.\n\nYou have 100 health. If you lose all your health, you have to restart the level. Here are a few enemies I thought of:\n\nA frog that hops around from platform to platform. They can be annoying because they will take up space on your platform.\n\nA crayfish with above average health and has claws to attack you. They can boost backwards in the water, but they are easy to hit when they are crawling.\n\nA water strider that only stays on the surface of the water, so they can't get you when you aren't in the water.\n\nA small leech that sticks on to you and drains your health while healing itself. They aren't hard to deal with if there is only one on you, because all you need to do is fire your pebble gun. But if multiple are on you, you have to fire your gun multiple times, and they drain more health from you.\n\nAnd more. Here's a boss idea.\n\nA large crayfish with a hard exoskeleton. Your are on a fallen tree branch that is half underwater. The crayfish is in the water. The crayfish will try snapping it's claws on you and smashing it's claws down on the branch. You can damage it by shooting pebbles at the claws. It can move left to right while it's claws are on the branch to try to hit you, but there will always be space at the two ends of the branch for you. Hitting the claws enough will make the crayfish go onto the tree branch. He will snap his claws at you, moving forward every time, and you can jump over him if it corners you. If you stay on his back for too long, he will shake your off. Damage him with your pebble gun enough and it will fall into the water and die."

8ijv77,Tree growing metroidvania,"So I just happened to be looking at rejected themes for ludum dare 41 and one was ""never stop growing."" Suddenly I came up with this idea:\n\nSo you start out as a tiny tree and once the game starts it starts growing. It'll keep growing until its killed. However, you can influence which direction it grows, i.e. which branches to grow.\n\nI can think of two control schemes: One would be cycling through the different ""main branches"" and that is the branch you control manually. A better scheme, though, would be the tree grows toward the mouse. The closest point on the tree to the mouse is where the tree grows and branches from. This would probably give  the most freedom.\n\nAs you grow you collect power-ups and fight bosses metroidvania style. Haven't given much thought to combat. (Maybe you can fire spores?)\n\nThe point is that there is no stagnation. The ""backtracking"" is simply continuing to grow at a different place on your tree in a different direction."
8ielef,"""Terror Tales"", Horror Themed TCG","Premise: Horror themed TCG were each player has a ""Hero"" character that must survive a horror house of their opponents construction, facing monsters, traps and horrors their hero can be equipped with weapons, companions and spells to survive.\n\nDecks are constructed around a setting ""environments"" whether they are tombs, houses, museums, cypts, etc that their opponents hero must survive rounds or ""acts"" in order to win. \n\nAt the end of several acts the hero will face their opponents boss monster as the means to win the game.\n\nGameplay: Players will display their hero and the environment that their opponents hero will travel through, The main monster will be placed faced down on the side and revealed at a phase of the game or from specific card effects.\n\nPlayers draw a hand of cards and will decide who goes first, Players then place event cards in an attempt to impede their opponents hero or cards that enchance their own through the opponents environment.\n\nPhases: Draw, Events, Hero Act, Results.\n\nWin Conditions: Players hero defeats opponents main monster, opponent runs out of cards or other conditions based around environment or main monster is met."
8id4ua,Permadeath RPG but you reincarnate as befriended NPC's,"(Insert typical 2d top-down RPG stuff youve heard before) Pretty short but largly story driven. When the story ends, the game ends. You start as an adventurer, but if/when you die, you become someone who you have a good relationship with. Talk to a vendor a lot? They are in the pool of people that can finish the story for you when you die. Village people you help out or even people with a lot of power and influence (mayors, kings etc). Maybe befriend the local wizard so you can be a powerful spellcaster on your second life. \n\nThis would go on until the game-over screen which would happen if you ran out of people. Making a friend is like getting an extra life, and some people are harder to befriend than others. Trying to be friends with some people might even make an enemy depending their personality, which could be procedurally generated from play-through to play-through. There could be achievements for gaining control of certain ""hard-to-get"" characters.\n\nTo make sure the key mechanic gets used, the game would have to be difficult to beat with the starting adventurer, so part of the strategy would be side missions to befriend people more powerful than yourself. I think it would be fun, and its on the list of games I want to make myself if I even get round to it. Just throwing it out here for opinions."
8ic4wc,A Game where every time you die you take on aspects and traits of the enemy/enemies that kill you eventually resulting in permadeath.,I'm picturing a game like Dark Souls in terms of difficulty and Lore.  You the player must travel through a twisted and corrupt world doing battle with various mythical twisted creatures.  The difference is when you die you get corrupted ever so slightly taking on the features of the creature maybe even gaining some special abilities. Die too many times and you'll suffer from permanent corruption becoming a mindless mini boss at the place where you died.  The player then shifts to a new body a fresh blood clean and uncorrupted human.

8i2rtr,"A metroidvania style game with semi-realistic science fiction elements featuring interplay between atmospheric conditions, pressure locks, gravity controls, and spacewalks told through a morally ambiguous story with a few twists.","Story: A partial power failure has corrupted the life support systems in Loading Dock Delta, leaving you without your memory but sparing you the more fatal effects experienced by the remaining stasis pods. You have been awoken by a hologram being generated by the ship's computer. From it you learn that you are the last surviving human aboard this ship, the last of a small band of refugees fleeing the war and allowed passage on a frigate currently being sub\-contracted to transport violent prisoners\-of\-war from several alien species. \n\nAn uprising has occurred, the ship's human crew are all dead, battle between the alien factions has separated the ship into sections barricaded by air locks, destroyed passages exposed to space, and conflicted battle zones. In accordance with Azimov's three laws, it is the computer's duty to assist a human in mortal peril. Therefore, she has been tasked with helping you make your escape. She is additionally compelled to return her memory banks to the Corporation, however, damage to all sub\-space transmission arrays means she must be transported there by hand. She will assist in your escape with the hope that, like you, she may be granted passage as a refugee.    \n\nThe story will unfold based on the player's play style. Should the player follow the guidance of the Corporation's computer, passage to the escape pod at the far end of the ship will follow a more direct \(and violent\) route, with the ability to mend corrupted maps, revealing the location of useful items and areas, and access security locks to open direct passages, though often at the expense of the lives of the ship's alien passengers. However, another set of guidance is available on the personal tablets and writings of both the ship's dead crew and it's alien passengers. The insight they provide suggests the ship is carrying both benign refugees and violent criminals. They give navigation that circumvents conflict with a unique set of tools designed to manipulate the environment, but lacking the guidance of a map.\n\nThe player must make their way to the bridge, the computer's system has been corrupted and she must reestablish a link to release the pod on which you intend to escape. Should by this point, you follow the computer's wishes, you will have blown the bridge's occupants out into space, upon which you can safely enter and mend the corrupted programming and enter the final stage of getting to the pod by battling your way into dangers of the engine\-works. \n\nShould they remain alive \(by following the guidance of the passengers\), a confrontation will ensue, with three humans still alive on\-board. It is revealed that a mutiny did indeed take place. The ship's first officer led a faction of aggressors in an attempt to commandeer the vessel with the intent of selling its passenger's on the slave market. In the struggle, all but three of those loyal to the Captain had died, but not before the first officer could load her cerebral network into the computer, preserving her mind like a virus in the database while her body died. The three technicians quickly set up internal firewalls to contain the virus but yielded control of the escape pods and other systems in the process. You must help them reestablish engine control by traversing through the above mentioned dangers of the engine\-works, allowing them to deliver safe passage to the refugees and justice to the criminals. \n\nJust some additional thoughts: The vessel is designed around a central Alcubierre Drive engine with a rotating outer hull which supports artificial gravity through centrifugal force. I want to play with idea of being able to manipulate the turning speed to change the level of artificial gravity as well as the concept of livable atmospheres and the need for space suits or the usefulness of being able to clear a chamber of baddies with an airlock or by blowing a window open. Upgrade\-able items and weapons will allow the user easier navigation and combat in zero gravity situations. A limited air supply on the space suit will present puzzles and challenges as the player progresses through the heavily damaged ship. \n\nTL:DR : Survive in space or don't, kill people or don't, escape or don't. Either way, no one will hear you scream. \(The title is pretty much my TL:DR\)  \n\n## "
8i0yr8,Escape Zombies,"I just thought of a game idea I’m not sure if there’s anything like it out there so here goes:\n\nImagine a cross between Escape the Room &amp; COD zombies.\n\nA multiplayer (local &amp; online) game where up to 4 players join &amp; start inside a room filled with puzzles/riddles.\n2 players must solve the puzzles while the other 2 must fend off waves of zombies trying to get in.\n\nThe 2 players fending off zombies start with basic weapons (i.e: crowbar) &amp; can only get better weapons whenever the other 2 solve a puzzle (or series of puzzles).\nPuzzles unlock not just weapons but items (extra life, armor...) or perks (stronger ammo, faster movement...)\n\nNo more than 2 players can have weapons at any 1 time.\nWhen unlocking a weapon, only 1 player can use it, the team must unlock another instance of that weapon for the 2nd player to be able to use it too (only 1 weapon instance/player).\nNo more than 1 weapon can be held per player aside from a melee weapon &amp; items/perks.\nUnlocked &amp; unequipped weapons remain on the floor or in the space they were swapped at.\n\nThe goal is to reach the final room or escape the “house” before time expires.\n\nDoes it sound like a game you’d enjoy playing?\nMaybe also have a VR version?\n"
8i0gin,An RPG game based in a single house/yard. However the character and NPCs are extremely tiny.,"The story is you buy this abandoned house in the middle of nowhere only to find out its cursed and all previous inhabitants/creatures make up factions for each room/area of the property.

8hzao7,Here's an idea for a NotReallyAMoba 8V8 Game?,"I would just call it a Battle Arena to be honest but then again it's totally not Halo or Unreal Tournament. But it's not completely a traditional Moba either.\n\nThe point of view of this game is similar to most mobas.\nHowever, the physics and mechanics and overall map design would be in 3D\n\nMaps would be tridimensional, with a top floor and a bottom floor. each floor will have 3 lanes, meaning there would be some 6 routes to go in order to get to enemy base\n\nThe objective? Destroy the enemy nexus\n\nCharacter based games, each character will have 3 basic abilities and an ultimate. no pasives. two adicional slots will be left for usable objects in the map, be it weapons or camo. they would store in your inventory. they would act as a summoner spell. you will use these objects once and they will dissapear from your inventory.\n\nThe reason why I don't call this a MOBA is because.. the nexus respawns. Each you time you kill the nexus your team gets 1 point. there might or might not be a set scores to win. maybe 3 scores to win or maybe not.\n\nBecause the maps are basically 3D arenas in the sky, and here's me using Halo Forge maps as an example (because i suck)\nhttps://bootofjustice.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/lockout1.jpg\n\nand there will be 3D physics.\n\nThe movements mechanics will be somewhat of a mixture between click to move and tradicional WASD controls. Click to move should never guide you to a pitfall, it would be used to just travel long distances without looking at your character. WASD will be used to make skillful jumps as either to engange in fights or jump between one platform to another so you can rush to enemy base faster.\n\nalso there is no such thing as farming, exp gain or level up.\nyou straight up pick a character and go battle\n\nControls\n\nWASD and Right Click to move\nSpace: Jump\nShift: Focus camera on character\n1 2 3 and 4: Basic abilities and ultimate\nQ and E For weapons and objects you pick up on the map\n\n(I hope somebody make this game)"

Tank, DP, priest, collectors etc... The collector needs to go around the map and collect pieces of a deity. The pieces are randomly scattered around the map. The collector has little to his attack and must have other players support him while collecting. The tank takes the brute of the attacks but if he dies then you lose a piece of your deity. Once you complete your deity the spirit is released you then must guide the spirit to your opponent to win.\n	Each player will be able to level up the characters and get them stronger over time. Their levels will increase and stay increased from game to game. The player will get points for killing, collecting, completing the deity and winning the game. The points will be used to upgrade your characters. Any thoughts or opinions?\n\nEdit: format"

6vpjo5,Multiplayer Endless Runner.,"Not just score board.\n\n\nBest done with vehicle themed.\n\n\n---\n\nIncludes All the thing you know about Endless Runner , and now Multiplayer!\n\nTo pull it off\n---\n\nWe will give auto-generation *less* power as compared to usual runner.\n\n^not ^really ^. ^Just ^different ^method ^and ^goals ^.\n\nThere will be no map. But there will be **checkpoints.**\n\nFor each plates/segment from game level... they are connected randomly to another plates/segments. Except some of them is special than usual one , at least we will have a special plates/segments that provide 2 or more exits and interconnect with other plates. Not sure about how many variation do we need.\n\n\n**Problems :** There are probability of meeting same segments more than 6 times in a row. Few situations.\n\n1. player probably had to restarts due crash or something.\n2. players passing/meets same player over and over and over in same route.\n3. player we just met suddenly gone during segments/plates transfer.\n4. ... er list me more , cannot think of it.\n\n**Solutions :** ^^together ^^, ^^helps ^^! I think there are few exploits or we can force stuffs.\n\n\n* (3)we can overwrite the non-sync player with A.I. when exchange plates/segments.\n    * and slow them down so they will disappear from the screen , because ... RUNNER GAMES!\n* (2)connect them to solo segments/plates for a while every several multiplayer segments.\n* (2)player are required to have 3 bikes to access multiplayer mode.\n    * this allow us to lies , lets say Player A meets Player B - we display Player B with his second bike. the next encounter we will display Player B with his third bike.\n* (all)make sure the props/scenery are friendly to auto-generate:\n    * player will be in same plates/segments again , but if the system is great enough we can lie a lot.

The aesthetic change didn't match previous plates/segments.\n\n---\n\nCheckPoints\n---\n\nNot all plates have them , not all session starts from a checkpoints. But we should tell them as soon as possible if they are connected to a *specific* CheckPoints. \n\nAlso if can , makes each checkpoint unique ; to search and gather at them will be a task(incase of meet-up)\n\nPlayer can stop at these checkpoints , even parking if needed.

6vpjbj,A Military Style RPG Could be really cool.,"Now, I know this might sound a bit out the ordinary for a usual RPG, but I think it could work in the realms of an RPG, while still being as realistic as possible, and here's why:\n   Setting: Even if the places themselves were made. up, they should still be made based off of one location, and it should stick to one or two (real or fake) countries (not a full countries, just a few places where fighting a war would make sense).\n   Story: The story could be simple, you're a new recruit for one of three faction (I'll get to that later), and what would typically count as classes and spells could be made into specialization, i.e. Demolitions Expert, Reconnaissance Expert, Assault team, and they would offer different perks.\n   Factions: While the factions could be tweaked, three join-able factiobs could be the opposing force, maybe more militarized than their competitors. The defending force, which have a bit more men, but less sophisticated weapons. Lastly, there could be a Resistance, which wants to take their country back. They would have less soldiers and arms, but they would have the support of the populace, while the others might be shunned in most places. Maybe some smaller factions like gangs that are only available to the defenders, and the resistance.\n   Dungeons: Dungeons could be enemy bases that have to be taken, and the 'boss' could be an important general for their army. Loot could be experimental weapons and armor, and the bases themselves could offer extra advantages, although  that'd be rare.\n   Companions: Companions could be squad mates, mercenaries, or even weird politicians, but they should each have their own style of fighting/acting in certain situations.\nThese aren't all the things that make an rpg good, but they're pretty essential. I'm no dev, but I think it could be done. Feel free to add anything, or tell me how wrong I am..."
6vorc3,Dungeon Crawler/Crafter MMO,"OK so the idea is simple enough. Leverage a multiplayer web platform to create a seamless and practically infinite dungeon crawling experience, by utilizing modular organization techniques similar to those of the legendary Minecraft... but with a very traditional and old school feel.\n\n...\n\nSo you've all heard of roguelikes... Where there are maze-like dungeons that go down many levels, with monsters and traps and all sorts of loot, and bosses and leveling up and swords and shields and bows and armor and potions and all that good stuff.\n\n...\n\nSo, here we go. On the surface, you have your usual shops. They could be built out of modular pieces, maybe even some sort of player run shops system to minimize the use of static NPC's. My personal pet peeve... Very green and friendly, with a day and night cycle, and farming of animals and plants and boring stuff, probably for potion ingredients to sell to adventurers, I bet the girls will love that part. Also, weapon and armor crafting.\n\n...\n\nBut the real fun starts below the surface, where there would be a main ""developer's quest branch"" of dungeon levels, but branching off of that, in ingenious ways, would be player built dungeon levels! Just like in a lot of anime and silly little web dungeon games, you would get to craft special magical dungeon stuff out of the souls of the players who meet their end in your section... Or you can just buy dungeon appliances from the surface shops, with gold you earn from adventuring, but super expensive...\n\n...\n\nSo basically, your dungeon section's difficulty level is somehow adjusted based on real statistics, such as number of monsters and traps, and how many adventurers it killed and their levels, and that determines the depth at which your section resides. Level 1 dungeon sections, for instance, would probably all be very crowded together under ground, and your halls would be cramped, and your monsters would be weaker versions and drop lower quality loot.\n\n...\n\nYou would be able to play in any role, of course, from adventurer, to shop keepers, to crafters, to dungeon ""keeper,"" as it were... Everyone would be in a rush to level up, and vying for the best sections in the dungeon to take down over-confident adventurers, and there would be all sorts of goodies and secrets for people to discover.\n\n...\n\nDungeon crafters could make their dungeons very unique, with custom (pre-approved) banners and etchings and lighting and maybe even mood music. You could choose all sorts of plants and animal species, even totally random useless things like bats hanging from the ceiling and slugs and snails leaving slime trails, just for that extra element of dungeoni-ness. You could decide to go with a bunch of long winding passages, or make a big open space like a boss level, and populate it with as many or as few creature spawn points as you want.\n\n...\n\nThere would be several prestige bonuses for each type of player as well. Higher level adventurers could choose their signature markings of power, such as looking bigger and tougher, or having special glowy sparkly auras, or whatever. Shops and dungeon sections would be highlighted in various colors by quality and price on guild hall maps.\n\nAn added benefit of being in a guild is that you get to see a map with a vague representation of the different dungeon branches, and shops, so that you can, for instance, locate a rare monster, or go straight for a more challenging dungeon section, or find cheaper herbs and potions. The guild halls would also be where you could bid on the best locations for your shops and dungeon sections.\n\n...\n\nEvery so often you will want to re-stock and repair your dungeon section, like after a bunch of adventurers defeat your monsters... You can also buy armor and weapons for your monsters to equip when they spawn. Your dungeon section would also double as your private vault, where you could create a hidden room that is extremely hard to reach, with your own treasure chest, because adventurers have to pay extra for storage at the bank!\n\n...\n\nAccording to some sort of algorithm, different underground herbs and certain wild creatures might be attracted to your dungeon section! Things like temperature (yes, you can adjust your dungeon's climate), how open it is, brightness, and even some of the ambient objects that (you thought) are just for looks... Those conditions (and others) could also affect and alter the stats of wild things, with all sorts of interesting possibilities... these would all attract more adventurers to your section, which would mean more souls and more space and goodies for you to use to customize and craft the perfect level."
6vn9rf,A post apocalyptic game where the human race is gone and robots are the only ones left,In this game you're a group of robots or just one who survived the end of the world and you must survive by learning to keep yourself maintained by  learning to repair yourself while scavenging junk. while other robots try to do the same and you have the choice to help others or to go against them. You can also mod yourself where you can replace one arm with a different part such as a makeshift flamethrower or a shield. You can swap out your robot legs to some wheels and you can travel faster. There would be a deep crafting system where you can create any post apocalyptic type of weapon or mod for yourself. This is just a quick little idea I had I didn't think too much of it.
6vmc5d,Moba/Survival Island game,"Hi guys,\n\nI would really appreciate if you read this full post and tell me what you think of it and what I can improve.\nSo I have had this idea for a while where I want to create a 6v6 competetive base building game. It is kind of a mix between a survival game and a moba.\n\nEach team will get a spawner which they have to place down on a location they think is best. If the spawner isn't placed before one of the team members has died he can't spawn back into the game untill it is placed. The objective of the game is to destroy the other teams spawner. If a team is wiped out before they have placed their spawner they are also defeated. Players can use different kind of materials to build a base around their spawner to protect it.\nThe game takes place on a island with lots of trees and rocks and even some animals on it. These are used to build up your base and to stay alive. In the first 2 minutes there is a wall in the middle of the island that seperates the 2 teams so they can safely put down their spawner. After 2 minutes the wall dissapears and everyone can roam over the island without limitations.\n\nBefore the game starts each player can choose between 3 kind of classes: the builder, the hunter and the gatherer. Each class with its own specifik skill set.\n\nThe builder: This class is very good to build up your base, this class can build much quiker and more advanced things than the other classes. This class is also very good to forge weapons.\n\nThe hunter: This class is best for hunting food and to kill and protect gatherers so the other team falls behind on building their base or to protect your own gatherer from getting killed. the hunter is also very good with the bow that he gets for free when spawning. Players can also die from starvation so it's the hunters job to make sure that there is food for everyone.\n\nThe gatherer: This class is used to gather wood, stone and other materials. This guy is very strong and he can carry way more items then the hunter and builder can but he is very weak in combat and needs much protection.\n\nPlayers earn experience by doing things there character is supposed to do, for example, a builder gets experience for building a wall or making a weapon but if he decides to hunt for materials he won't get any experience from it. Experience points can be used to upgrade perks which are specifik for every class. If a hunter gets enough experience he can choose to upgrade his aim, or to receive more food from killing animals. These are just examples I want to create a very large skill tree to really make players think about what they should spend their experience on.\n\nThis game takes a lot of teamplay and strategie to win. Players can choose to play a very aggresive playstyle from minute one and try to get the enemy spawner in the first few minutes by picking 3 hunters, but this tactic can also backfire because if the other team manages to survive they will have lots of materials to build a stronger base and better weapons so they will be much stronger in the late game.\n\nWhen the players are selecting their class they can't see what the other team has picked. So it's always a gamble on what kind of tactic you're going to use. Are you going to sacrifice a gatherer for another hunter? This might lead to following behind on technology and materials.\n\nIf a player dies he is still in the game but he has to wait a certain amount of time depending on what stage of te game you are in. So if a player dies in the first 5 minutes of the game he will have to wait for 2 minutes but if someone dies in the 30th minute of the game he has to wait for 10 minutes. This is a crucial part of the game because dying really matters. If a hunter dies you're gatherers will become unprotected so one of the other teams hunter might hunt him down. If a gatherer dies, then your builder will have a lot less materials to build with and the other team will have a stronger base.\n\nThere are a lot of different types of animals on the island ranging from chickens to bears. Chickens are very weak and won't give you a lot of food and experience but are an easy target. Bears are the strongest animals on the island, they will take a lot of damage and they can hit very hard. But if you manage to kill them they will give you a lot of food and experience. There will be lot's of other animals.\n\nThere are also a lot of different materials on the island. in the first stages of the game wood and stone will be the most important to build your base but later on materials like iron and sulvur will become very important to make weapons and ammunition. There will be more materials.\n\nI am also trying to implement some elements into the game that can turn the game around. For example something like a baron in league of legends where the losing team can get a buff that brings them back into the game for a certain amount of time.\nI was thinking of some random events that happen in the game where there is some sort of giant animal and if a team kills it they gain a massive amount of xp.\n\nI know that it would be almost impossible to make this game but i wanted to share my idea anyway."

6vjs2r,Card Collecting Game,"A friend of mine once told me that he was playing the Pokémon Digital Card Game just because he enjoyed opening booster packs and collecting the cards he got from that. Since then, I've been wondering if a game about that could be made.\n\nI already know CARD COLLECT (android game, blame japanese if the name is all capitalized) and my idea of a game would be something similar, but with some more strategy built in, perhaps by being able to use up cards to get boosts of some kind.\n\nDoes anyone have any idea on how to do that? Which kind of effects could work?"
6vhg2r,How to improve a 2D platformer shooter?,"Hey guys,\n\nHow would you improve and/or introduce something new in a retro 2D platformer shooter? I've made one and it was fine (on Steam, PM me for the link, don't want to get accused for self-promotion) but for the remake/sequel I need something that attracts people, something to stand out in the crowd.\n\nAlso the game is set in Prohibition era so lots of illegal activities (back then) is in the theme that we didn't cover.\n\nI was thinking of bootleg beer that would find in back of the houses and each would either power up or power down you but it's not enough or anything major.\n\nI'm open to the idea of adding roguelike elements but I think it needs something very interesting added to it's core and then add all these on the top.\n\nWhat would you suggest/do?\n\nThanks"
6vbpqo,[Feedback Needed] A Multiplayer Steampunk Adventure game inspired by Studio Ghibli &amp; Breath of the Wild,"Hey,\n\nWe are a small team of experienced developers and while this idea has been in the works internally for some time now, we would like to validate the idea externally to see if others find interest in it too.\n\n\nThis doesn't contain all the concept details, since things do change quite often in this stage and we can't present all the mechanical differentiating factors just yet.\n\n**Concept Overview:**\n\n* A game about letting players go on an adventure, in a multiplayer setting. A steampunk-inspired Action-Adventure game set in a monster-infested World where Humans found refuge in Floating Cities. \n\n* To deal with scarce resources the Humans must now hunt monsters and reconquer back what was once theirs, artistically inspired by Studio Ghibli &amp; mechanically inspired by Breath of the Wild.\n\n* The game is a cooperative PvE experience where players assume the role of adventurers that dream of being called Heroes. The players face innumerable enemies and bosses, solve challenging puzzles, meet interesting characters and make friends along the way.\n\n**Setting:**\n\n* Enormous structures fractured from the World, floating in the sky, imposing but beautiful. The New Cities, they called them. They were a safeguard for the Humans. \n\n* These Floating Cities were a place free of the horrors of war, a place the humans could return to their simple way of life and start anew. This, however, wouldn’t last, for demons took over the World below and consumed many of its resources and the Floating Cities couldn’t sustain the growing Human population. With scarce resources to live by, they now have to hunt the same monsters they ran away from.\n\n* Floating Cities contain large Tower-like structures that connect the Cities to the monster-infested World below. Inside of each floor of the Tower is a portal to a small inter-dimensional section of the World, filled with rare ancient relics and resources. \n\n**Main Mechanics:**\n\n* Action-based combat: In the style of BotW and other action-oriented games, with emphasis on individualized fights (small groups of enemies) and interesting AI. This includes combos, heavy/light attacks, counter-attacks, targeting and dodging but also interesting environment interactions. ([Mechanics Example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=So0QgL7AaAc)\n)\n\n* Freedom of Choice: The player has a wide range of ways to deal with situations. For instance, if a party of players want to attack an Orc camp and steal their treasure, some of those players can climb to an high place to set up a trap while other players attract attention of the Orcs to the trap. The trap can include using a ranged-weapon to set up a series of exploding barrels, or it might include other devious contraptions.\n\n* Cooperation is Rewarded: Being a multiplayer game, the players are rewarded for cooperation, from Bosses that become easier to handle with multiple players to actual quests that can only completed in groups that provide great rewards. \n\n**Example Storyboards:**\n\n* [Intro](https://i.imgur.com/tQiCzxt.png)\n\n* [Example of cooperative Boss Fight (ignore the additional notes, it's outdated, we don't plan PvP)](https://i.imgur.com/QXagwo0.png)\n\n**Standout Features:**\n\n* Multiplayer: where hundreds of players can play alongside. (we're avoiding the MMORPG tag for now, because the gameplay doesn't follow the typical MMORPG formula, it's more action-adventure focused, there isn't a weapon-class based system, the game is meant to be played on a controller, and we don't expect the same amount of content, things to do, and replayability typically found in that genre etc)\n\n* Artstyle: being inspired by Studio Ghibli includes charming characters, narratives and beautiful art. (This doesn't mean childlike though, think more Mononoke and less Ponyo)\n\n* Setting &amp; Story.\n\nDo you find the concept interesting? Would you personally be interested in buying a game like this?"
6v8848,Zombie game where first half is surviving against the hoard and second half is the horror of being the last human on earth,"I had an idea for a narrative driven zombie game where the first half is all about teaming up with your little squad of survivors, getting supplies, and killing zombies. At the half way mark however all your friends get killed and the zombies just die out. From there it turns into more of a psychological horror game where the player is haunted by visions of their friends and it gets a more Silent Hill 2 style surrealist horror atmosphere.\n\nEdit: spelled horde incorrectly in the title! oops!"
6v7lqp,Horror FPS/Overview multiplayer,"So, first off I did look back several pages but nothing similar or in searches so I apologize if I stumble over anyone's idea.\n\nMy vision for this is a game where one player (the one who sees the overhead view) places the monsters and traps while the team of 2-4 progress through the map. The map having randomly places key items. The usual circuit, keycard, battery and such needed to progress to the next area.\n\nThe over-viewer would be able to see where everyone is and each player will have a ""safe"" zone around them so you can not just spawn an enemy on top of them or say in their view. Would have to be around corners, behind them, or in special spots such as vents.\n\nEach player will have their own customization from the weapons they bring where as the over-viewer will be able to customize the monsters. The type of skills they have as well as the type of monster such as (flying,crawling, etc..). I imagine monsters being limited on points with each skill or trait having its own value.\n\nJust an idea I have had in my head for awhile, I don't expect anything to come from posting this but I just wanted to get it out there. xD"
6v7loj,A battle royale arena shooter,"I've been watching a streamer who plays a lot of Playerunknown's Battlegrounds, and my current obsessions kind of leaked into it and I came up with an idea that may or may not actually be any good.\n\nThe thing I don't like about battle royale games like PUBG is that they have the weird psudeo-realism that's been popular as of late; inventory management, jumps that are so pitiful they might as we'll not be there, stamina meters, etc. I much prefer the classic FPSs, Doom, Duke 3D, Shadow Warrior, Quake, all those. That last one specifically has been an obsession of mine as of late. It's just so damn fun and satisfying. So why can't there be a battle royale game like Quake? Something like PUBG, but with fast, twitchy, crazy arena shooter gameplay like Quake. Or, inversely, an arena shooter deathmatch with a large open world. \n\nOverall, I think the maps in battle royale games tend to be pretty lackluster and boring. Mostly fields and hills, with maybe some towns here and there for variety. I'd like it better if there were more variety. Buildings and such that could serve as arenas for gunplay. It wouldn't really matter what, I envision this nonexistent hypothetical pipe dream as a kind of campy ""retro throwback"" that disregards logic and realism in its world in favor of its gameplay. The world would also have to have much more verticality than the average battle royale to accomodate the gameplay, rocket jumping around and launching rococheting projectiles doesn't exactly work on a flat plane. Maybe you could even throw in hidden weapon caches and ketcards to make things even more varied, though I don't know how well that would work gameplay-wise. \n\nAnother problem I have with games like PUBG is weapon variety. It's always pistols, shotguns, assault rifles, and snipers. I would want more types of weapons. Not just rocket launchers, nail guns, and BFGs either. This is where my other current obsession comes into play. The game could have tons of weapons, all with unique mechanics and functionality, a la Enter the Gungeon. There could be guns that inflict damage over time, guns that stun, bullets that shoot guns, things like that.\n\nHealth would need a major reworking as well, to line up more closely with shooters of old. Instead of a few shots from any gun being enough to kill or nearly kill a player, each weapon would have unique damage and potency. And instead of consumables restoring health, there could be pickups on the ground, though there could still be consumable health regens akin to Duke 3D's Portable Medkits, albeit rarer than the first aid and adrenaline shots of PUBG. \n\nI don't really know much of anything about game design or development, this was mostly me just throwing the games I'm obsessed with at the moment into a pot to improve (read: cater exclusively to my tastes) a genre that I like the concept of, but not the execution. I really just typed reddit.com/r/gameideas into the address bar hoping to find a place to ramble off my idea to people that are more familiar with games, especially the ones relevant to my idea, than my friends are. \n\nI apologize if I came off as long-winded or if anything was hard to understand. I have an obsession with grammar and tend to really overthink things like word choice, and I'm always afraid I end up rendering my writing unreadable as a result. \n\nI'm also not quite sure how to flair this. I was originally thinking abstract, but as I started typing I realized I had more to say than I thought. Maybe experienced? This is also my first post on this sub, so I don't really know what the general standards for the categories are."
6v41ho,Dystopian game where you play a character that works WITH the system.,"I was looking at a trailer for ""We Happy Few"" (it's apparently fallen into a lot of controversy recently) and it looks like a really fun setting. But, as with a lot of dystopian games, as far as I could tell, the protagonist will try to fight AGAINST the system, running from the smiling police, refusing to take the happy pills, etc.\n\nI reckon it would make an interesting game if you had the option of playing a character who *did* take the pills, and did try to be as law-abiding as they could. It could still be horrific - in fact, even more so, since the main character would not be in the process of escaping the system, but subjecting themselves to it with no escape in sight. You would build relationships with other citizens, and then wonder where they went after they are reported missing.\n\nI have two ideas for the goal of this game - the first would just be to survive for as long as possible, juggling the threats of your own deteriorating mental state, the suspicion of the authorities, the work you have to do to survive in the society, etc.\n\nThe second would be more heroic, but still in a way that forces you to submit to the system - the game would be more of a strategy (although might still be played through a first-person/third-person perspective to give it a more intense, personal feel) and would be quite similar to Schindler's List. i.e., your character would work with the oppressive regime, trying to avoid suspicion and perform their duty on the outside, while smuggling other citizens out of the country, or undermining the government from the inside.\n\n------\n\nThe games I have in mind are obviously not all that fleshed-out mechanically. I just think it'd be an interesting new angle on the dystopian theme, given that with most of these games (Bioshock Infinite, We Happy Few... I can't actually think of any other examples off the top of my head, right now...) have your character completely rebelling against the system instead of keeping up the pretense of participating in it happily."
6v1uk1,"MMORPG (simple idea, use as you want)","You have your non-typical MMORPG. It's easy when you need to enjoy your time, it can give you a decent run for your money when you want to.\n\nYou have your typical exp level and a soul meter which grants you ability to use your skills at 100% or even overclock them.\n\nBut every time you level up, you lose a part of your soul.\nTo lower this negative stuff to 10%, you would need to get mind particles, which you get by exploring world only (limited on map, and small daily reward).\n\nAlso, dying alot will eat a small parts of your soul. Heh, heh."
6ypj4h,How would you guys feel about making a reddit purely for game prototypes and not story lines.,"I constantly see post here that go something like..\n""GTA but in a different setting..""\n""Skyrim but add everything and tons of features..""\n""You play as a mercenary and everyone wants to kill you..""\n\nIm willing to make a moderated subreddit where instead of posting game dreams you can only post potential prototype ideas.. or game concepts..\n\nFor example.\nInteractive Fiction Stealth game.\nhttp://www.squidi.net/three/entry.php?id=169\n\nOf course it does not have to be nearly as complex as that. But the entire thing is nothing but game mechanics. There is no story line. Its a prototype that you can look at and have a good idea of what game this person has made in his head. What do you guys think? A more mature /r/gameideas if you will."

6youbg,WAR!!! (The Strategy Game That Kicks A**!*(*If I Ever Make It)),"**What is WAR!!!?**\n\n[This Link Explains It](https://orype.deviantart.com/journal/WAR-Time-to-kick-ass-329771541)\n\nBut in all seriousness, it's a dumb strategy game that I made in a couple of days that I really got attached to, mostly cause I love how dumb it can be. Essentially, I would want to get this to an actually computer strategy game, although there would have to be some changes to it, since it isn't too complete.\n\n**Realistic Concerns**\nOkay, so as much as I would like to have all three game modes as their own separate features in there...it would probably be best to do something along these lines:\n1. Having a giant campaign map, looking similar to Risk, but not being the planet Earth (it's much to cool for that). So, you can have armies move territory by territory, and them invading into another territory would start a fight.\n2. Having a smaller map based on the territory, so that you can move units around that is either a Straight up RTS (Like Total War) or something turn based (similar to Romance of the Three Kingdoms).\n3. Having the option to either let the player fight these out in a Brawler style(Like Project X-Zone, or a straight up Brawler like Streets of Rage), where they can switch between the men commanding a unit until they're all dead. Or just have the option to auto-resolve the conflict, with the idea being that no individual Brawl would last more then a minute to help keep the flow going.\n4. A basic EXP system, which would encourage the player to Brawler more to gain it faster for a unit, at the cost of risking the unit collapsing if the Man leading it gets killed in the Brawl. But, you would get the ability to get some basic upgrades for the unit, up to maybe 4 from a pool of available ones.\n5. An Economy that has a simple currency (ManBucks) which is gained from owning territories, and upgrading them with maybe 2-3 buildings each. \n6. Faction specific win conditions, like the Humans wanting to control a certain portion of the map, the Zombies wanting to have a certain population size, the Wizards wanting a tower to the Moon, etc. \n*Other stuff*\nThese are things I'm not sure are required, and probably won't be, but are still stuff I'm putting out there.\n1. Having it that there are certain things you can own on the map which will give you cards every few turns, but taking up a building slot in the territory they are in. Then, having it that you can use these cards to spawn free units, or add extra abilities, or do other things like that before a battle or just to get extra ManBucks.\n2. Adding some basic rules for each unit, so that way each one of them has more value then just building the strongest of the strongest units all the time. Like, the lower zombies being able to gain extra men from successfully brawling another unit, or Wizards being able to summon make themselves harder to hit.\n3. Changing around or adding some Factions. This is definitely not something that needs to be done now, as there are 6 right now...but:\n-A. Maybe changing the Robots! to Scientists! so they can have a bit or a rivalry, and to have their Men be next to useless.\n-B. An ANIME! faction, with the lowest units being Trash (Your Waifu) and then building up to Protagonists (Who can OP), which is built on revenge for the loss of their ~~harem~~ friends.\n-C. A SPORTS! faction, with the units being Footballers, Footballers, Baseballers, and the like, so they all have ranged abilities...that don't hurt too much, but have a lot of punch up close.\n-D. NOT MEN! Think Amazons, Furies(The Greek ones), Valkyries, Scouts, and Princesses, with the army being themed to take advantage of Staying Power.\n-E. Monster...this is the most maybe out of all the maybes, especially since I do want to have a dragon, but the only way this would work was if everyone was Incredibly strong/elite...so yeah.\n4. Having Voice Acting in general...cause I can't do that well, and I'm pretty sure it wouldn't come out too nice if all the voices were just me. Mainly cause this is not important at all, but still good enough to bring it up.\n5. Making the game easily modifiable, although I have no idea how I would go about doing something like that.\n\n**Conclusion**\nSo with all of that being said, I do still want to turn WAR!!! into a strategy game that is stupid on the surface, but is actually a lot of fun to play after the joke has worn off. Right now, I know next to nothing about programming outside of Game Maker, and some basic tutorials I can find online for other systems, so I'm prepared for this to take like 3-4 years if necessary should I do this on my own. Some long term help would be appreciated, but isn't necessary per-say, I'm mostly curious about if other people think I should go forward with this idea."

6ylenm,NUKE BLAST protection game,"Everyone knows something about nuclear blast and effects, novadays that topic is also popular because of USA, Korean nuclear fetish people. \n\nOk here is the deal. Adding some tower defence logic to the game might be better.\n\n1- Distance to the blast. Beginning far(100km), within the turns, it gets closer. Or house will be same or there will be 2-3 kind of houses (with bunker, without bunker etc) and megaton of the bomb will changes... both sounds good. \n\n2- Every turn different house. Different structure to protect. Easy to hard.\n\n3- Every turn new equipments or different amount of materials to modify the house. (protection equipments for humans, food if there is bunker, window shields etc... there should be many different things to use and different effects. this step is the core of the game of course. )\n\n4- finish the round with targeted dead or injury numbers.. Yeah... Like 4 people in the property and target is ""2 deaths and and medium burns on skin"" . so you need to select whom to protect and whom will die. More survivals more points.  \n\n4-  a- wide screen gameplay, b-house on the right of the screen c-detonation before waiting blast time d- nice cartooney animations \n\ndetonation / blast steps :\n\ntermal effects on house at first blast and people in the house (all yellow white screen / surfaces which will effect by termal radiation and gama waves will be shown in black xray like animation. \n\nshockwave effects on the house and people. \n\n""after 1 week"" simulation in really fast forward.   \n\nmight be interesting eh? \n\ni have too much ideas about that kind of or more original things but i am not into software or i don't have enough energy to forward it. if that sounds cute to you tell me. i can share more when i have time.  \n\ncheers. \n "
6yjlcr,A game where you have to figure out how to operate most things.,"Better explanation:\n\nYou are dropped into a hostile environment with unfamiliar machinery and weapons. In other games, you adapt instantly to new machines, but that makes no sense. My idea is that you have to sit down for a bit to figure out how to operate a firearm or use alien tech.\n\nFiguring things out:\n\nWhen you pick up a new weapon, you have the option to bring the weapon up close to examine it. You can activate anything you see (like switches, buttons, triggers, and the like). Once you figure out how to use it, you retain the knowledge. The same goes with mechanical devices for puzzles."
6yixj5,A Cooperative Age of Empires MMO,"It's a concept that I've had for near 20 years now.  I've always thought it would be the natural progression of games, and expected to have seen this concept by now.  But, nothing.  So, I figure I'll put it out there in the hopes that one day it sparks the idea in a developer. \n\n## The Setting\n\nYou start as an immortal demigod.  Who can't die, not permanently at least. But can be reincarnated - to be respawned some minor distance away from your established respawn point. (both to avoid span camping, and to allow enemies time to seize your assets without you just popping back up over and over) You're on a map not much different than you might see in Age of Empires or Simcity, only massive. Limited resources, that vary by location and respawn at a set rate, become a point of contention to spur expansion, conquest, and cooperation.  But you can zoom all the way in, into first person view.  Or so far out that you can see a large portion of the map.  Where you can inspect your buildings, give your NPCs instructions, or even fight wars with them like you might in Rome Total War.\n\nYou have choices right from the beginning: \n\n1. take your character on an adventure, like a normal MMO, focusing on making that single character a badass \n2. collecting some resources to build your town center at the location of your choosing, to begin generating NPCs to do your bidding \n3. find the local large city/alliance and incorporate with them.  Purchasing NPCs, setting up stores for them to buy and sell items on your behalf, or go out and collect resources, or train soldiers for war.   By incorporating you agree to build appropriate buildings based on the zoning that the leader or his building advisor has set.  To pay whatever taxes they set for use in developing city services, armies, etc.  \n4. Stay neutral and focus on trade across markets, raiding cities for your own gains, or even spying for your true faction. \n\nOr, some combination of the above.  However _you_, the player, enjoy playing the most.  \n\n## NPCs\n\nRather than having the player grind mats they can send the NPCs out to get them.  Or to farm.  Set up a mine.  Even adventure to find mystical weapons and tech dropped from monsters.  Every NPC has it's own, individual skill tree.  While they all have access to the same skills, they're born with skews towards some over others.  And the rate at which they increase levels in those skills is 1. based on use (e.g. if you have them farming they'll gain agriculture and to a lesser extent strength) and 2. based on your technology (e.g. if you have a high level in horticulture they'll rank up in agriculture that much faster).  \n\nUnlike your champion, NPCs _can_ die, and it's permanent.  They also require food, shelter, entertainment, etc.  The happier they are the more productive.  But you don't need to micro-manage them. You _can_, but you can also set them to automatically work to meet demands.  Setting up farms as more food is needed, etc.  (Of course, they wont be as efficient as a real person who knows what they're doing).  This all works to rate limit how fast an individual can grow their NPC force.  And, in the process, means that either a high income to purchase what's needed for those goals or taxes are needed to support an army of them. \n\n## Science\n\nThis is more of a side to the overall concept of the game, but a concept in itself of how I think science should work.  \n\nTo start, rather than discrete discoveries everything is an infinite scale.  And every tick of time there's a chance for a discovery, rather than a predetermined time frame.  The more scholars you have focused on a given topic, the higher the chances of a discovery per tick.  And the topics are intertwined.  You can start off by trying to discover, say, siege technology from day one.  But since you know little about math or physics you have a very low chance of making progress.  (e.g. it will take a lot more trial and error to get it working, much less optimized, since you don't know how to use calculation for such purposes). So, putting some effort into things that aren't directly helpful, like math, physics, chemistry, etc, helps increase the chances that you'll make more practical discoveries, and faster. \n\nFurther, you can learn _from other players_.  You can send scholars to study their tech, drastically increasing your own scholars knowledge, or spies to enemy camps to steal concepts from them, giving you multipliers towards learning them faster.  This helps level the playing field, and keeping everyone advantageous to each other (no anti-noob syndrome). \n\nThat said, knowledge is tied to the NPCs. If all of your farmers and scholars are killed, that would become a big setback for your agriculture knowledge. Likewise, if _all_ of your NPCs are killed, you're effectively starting over.  (This should help keep the game fresh, and reinforce the notion of cooperation being important) \n\n## City Management, Buildings and Environment\n\nRather than preset locations for buildings the players can place them wherever they want.  (of course, within those zoning rules if they incorporate).  Like Age of  Empires there's also fences, watchtowers, etc. to help keep other factions from taking over your resources or killing your NPCs.  Any building within that user's ability and resources can built anywhere.  But, the buildings can also be destroyed.  So best to make sure you put that effort into a location that can be defended.  \n\nThe land is mutable as well.  As your miner's dig they create tunnels which you can explore with your hero.  That said, digging tunnels into enemy territory might be a good idea. Likewise, setting up defenses to try and prevent such actions as well.  Sometimes these result in finding ancient ruins with lost weapons and tech, creating an incentive to expand.  But be careful, the monsters in those ruins might just kill off your valuable NPCs.  \n\nThose who prefer playing city builders can focus their efforts on deciding the layout.  What direction to build towards, and what kinds of buildings should be where.  Using taxes to place defense structures/making the layout of the city one that can be better defended.  Offer police/security to help protect against spies or thieves.  Build roads to help with trade.   They of course have a hero, and all of the same abilities to use NPCs to further their cause.  But, that said, if the city leaders aren't careful they may funnel funds into their own coffers, or focus on building the layout in a way that gives them an unfair advantage over others - weakening your empire in favor of their own greed.  \n\n## Spying \n\nMuch like Age of Empires, you can see the parts of the map that you  (or others in your faction) know of, but cannot see what's lurking without having scouts or spies watching.   Armies can see one ""tile"" away, while scouts much further - depending on their skill.  There's a chance they can be discovered, but also a chance they can become a spy.  Blending in with the army and following them around, while learning about them and the people they work for.  Every tick there's a chance for them to be discovered.  It decays with time, as they gain trust, but is always non-zero.  And you can't know when the other player learns of them.  They could decide to feed them false info, or simply kill them (in which case you would know).  This makes it hard to trust any single spy, as they may be getting played.  So, if you want to be effective in you're spying efforts you need a network of them, so that you can put together common reports as real, and uncommon one's as fake.  \n\n## War\n\nWhen it comes time to take over another factions assets, war will be different for every player.  Some will command their armies, others march their heroes with them, others run small groups of spies to infiltrate the enemy and destroy supplies.  Heroes will always be much stronger than NPCs, easily killing them one at a time regardless of skill level, but struggle to face several at once.  (I think a lack of AOE skills is important here. Can't have a single hero wiping out an entire army.  Would make NPC armies pointless and turn the whole thing into a PVP hero battle...).  There should be various NPC types. Ranging from foot soldiers and archers to calvary to siege equipment operators. I've considered the notion of taming beasts, like dragons, but I'm not convinced that wouldn't result in an imbalance.  \n\nSince NPCs don't respawn there's a chance for larger factions to completely take over everything another has built.  Forcing that faction to relocate and start over, disband and incorporate elsewhere, or join their attackers incorporation and go back to running their city as they were.  While this lends itself to one faction eventually taking over all, I can't see that actually happening.  There will always be holdouts. Language barriers, those who genuinely dislike that faction, and those who want more of a challenge.  All of which can band together to overthrow that super power.  And keep in mind that war isn't the only option.  Subterfuge, destroying their resources, bankrupting them, leading their armies away for you to attack a mostly defenseless city, etc are all viable options.  Keeping the game persistent.\n\n## End Game\n\nI have a lot more specifics in mind - like how hero leveling and skills, crafting, etc should work, but this has become much larger than I expected.  So, I'll wrap here explaining how I think persistence and end game balance should work out. \n\nSince technology can be lost, and cities taken over, I expect that there will be something of a glass ceiling that will be maintained.  With various factions reaching close to it, only to lose progress.  People double crossing one another to individually maintain their progress, but losing reputation with other in the process.  Putting their progress more and more at risk as they go.  In the end behaving a lot like Eve Online - where factions will come to dominate only to become the target of the rest.  Creating a constantly shifting power struggle.  \n\n(I'm not going to bother proofreading the above.  It's too much for the maybe 20 people who will read it.  So, sorry if it's hard to read..) "

6y36t1,A brawler where all the characters are a mariachi band,That's it yep
6xzt9v,Hyper Realistic Survival Game,"Disclaimer: This idea is from watching Dark Souls while playing Fallout 4.\nHere's my idea: A hyper-realistic survival game set in a Fallout-esque universe due to it's uniqueness and charm. It would have you, the player, be dropped in the apocalypse similar to fallout 4 but have the vagueness of Skyrim. I.E.  You're walking down the street and for some reason are whisked 200 years into the future. New to your surroundings, your objective is to survive. \n\nI don't want your character to be what the game says he is, He needs to be a medium for you to act through in this new world. Think of how in Fallout New Vegas your backstory is you just deliver mail.  He is a silent protagonist meant to be you so obviously spoken dialogue is a no go. Similar to Dark Souls, after you come to terms with your new life in this world you just go. You don't need to be finding your son, looking for your dad, or be some kind of ""Chosen One"". You are yourself and the intrigue in this new world and questions of how you got here should drive you initially. Once you become the apocalyptic raider of your dreams then the game becomes living this life.  The scenery and world needs to be fleshed out enough so this isn't No Man's Sky, Destiny situation. You're here for the world and your life in it so it needs to be deep, without forcing the lore and story down your throat.\n\nNow it doesn't have to be as impossible to find as it is in Dark Souls but at the same time people won't talk about the apocalypse like it's new because they were born in it. Learn about the world from the world.\n\nSo you play a silent protagonist in a vibrant apocalyptic world with a focus on immersion and the ability to do everything you would want to do BUT, and this is a big but, the world follows suit. In Fallout 3 for example, you meet a group of rebels who are enslaved and forced to work night and day. If you choose to side with the rebels then you free them, kill their captors (Death to the masters Khaleesi) and they embrace their new life of freedom, except they don't. Once you free everyone the leader of the rebels comes up and is like ""Thanks for freeing us, actually becoming free will take time though so thanks"". The entire town this takes place in is then frozen completely. No new leader is elected, the other towns only do side quips about it (Psst, i know you. Hail Sithis.) and the entire town never moves past their newly free lives to using it for anything. In my vision for the game, if i kill the mayor, the town should A) collapse into anarchy B) elect a new Mayor C) etc etc etc. Obviously this level of depth in gaming isn't something that's been done before. Bethesda has said that games like Skyrim take around a decade to make. \n\nAnother thing i want is realism in damage. If i unload an SMG in the face of something, it needs to die. No amount of radiation, scientific experiments, or body armor can stop ten 50. cal. shots to the eyes. I want the damage to be like Pubg in that regardless of your proficiency, a gun is a gun. Seeing how this game takes place in a futuristic apocalypse then there might be ways to increase your defense so you can take a shot but it should never feel like The Division. You didn't upgrade rifleman so your military shotgun is now a super soaker, enjoy. Just to be clear this is a shooter, not an RPG. Bullets kill anything not made out of metal and things like ballistic vest only block so many shots to the same body part before they stop protecting you.\n \nMy biggest worry is that a game of this depth won't run smoothly which is counter intuitive to the immersion i want. Now i'm not a stickler for insane graphics but a certain level of it needs to be present. Personally my dream for a game like this would be for it to look like Far cry 3, at that level you can appreciate a sunset without sacrificing quality for frame by frame animation. I don't know much about the mechanical aspects of game design but a game like this would obviously be time consuming to make which could be a big factor seeing how i'm not a triple A studio.

6xx7ja,police game,"so basically the title, its a police simulator roleplay game and you get random scenarios like hostage situations to just people running red lights."
6xvtgo,A real-time combat pokemon style game,"The main concept of this idea is based around the fact that you explore the world and have similar goals to that of pokemon.  The major difference is that rather than turn based fighting, you can select which pokemon you want to fight with, and then you fight the other pokemon in real time combat such as normal top down rpg format (think zelda a link to the past) but with the normal pokemon switches as normal.  Along with that you can possibly combo pokemon's moves such as one has a freeze and another has a very critical attack that takes a long time to land, so you use the freeze, switch pokemon, then hit the large critical hit with the other pokemon."
6xv3ml,"Colony simulator, but you can move around. Focus on combat maybe.","I want to make a game similar to Dwarf Fortress / Rimworld (but a lot simpler of course). The main difference would be that you directly control a person on the world, you start alone, and end with a group of ""minions"" you give roles to. \nBut you can still move around your character... Maybe to give roles and construction orders you have to sit on a throne, then you get out of it and move around. (And combat with your most skilled minions)\n\nIf your people become discontent with your ruling they might attack you and you'll have to escape your own fortress, and if you survive you'll be able to start a new one. \n\nI am just throwing a bunch of ideas I think are cool, still not sure what to do. I want to keep it simple, I know that's the key to success. Would love to focus on combat and maybe dumb down a lot the management of resources. Would also love to make it so that you can be a kind ruler or a mean one that inspires fear on the minions.\n\nSuggestions? Do these ideas suck? Too complex? What would you like in a colony simulator like Dwarf Fortress? And thanks :D"

6xrumn,Idea- A RPG where you have a set-up time before the adventure starts.,"Idea (expanded):\n\nIt's a top-down RPG. You have a set-up time (1 week?) in a town to level up your character, buy items, and stuff like that. Once you hit the time limit, the boss comes around (""game-time"") and you embark on a smallish journey to kill it, and how you fare is based on skill and what you did in the set-up time.\n\nSet-Up Time:\n\nNow, your set-up time is valuable. You can level up by doing activities (e.g. working out, studying at libraries, etc.), shop, and possibly do opportunities (hard activities that give big rewards in the game-time).\n\nGame-Time:\n\nGame-Time happens when your set-up ends. The baddies start spawning, everyone panics, the final boss shows up, and other bad stuff. It would turn into a more traditional turn-based RPG, where you engage in random encounters in an overworld."
6xqjx2,[Design Doc] Lands of Exile - an MMOSRPG,[deleted]
6xpm77,[FEATURE] A Multiplayer RPG that has a focus on rewarding users that roleplay the most/best.,"So my idea is a feature that could be added to any multiplayer game that would benefit from its users playing the part more often.  Any game where you use mics, where you have a ""proximity chat"" and a ""squad chat"" if you are in a group of some sort. \n\n\nSo basically there would either be a way to give an equivalent of upvotes to people who roleplay well. if you get alot of upvotes your votes carry more weight maybe.\n\nWhen you level up due to your roleplaying, you either unlock new areas of the map, or you gain access to a second server or lobby  which uses the same maps.  There could be several levels of this so at the top level everyone is really into roleplaying.\n\nThis could work in a BUNCH of games.  \n\nObviously a game like WoW or  any fantasy/medieval setting game, but also a WW2 FPS game, or all of these games:\n\n[SpyParty\n](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKsAeLJeOVw&amp;ab_channel=Rhapsody)\n\n[Flight Sim X](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPNN8w2XlwY&amp;ab_channel=Airforceproud95)\n\n[Star Trek: Bridge Crew](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT1Dg50BRDU&amp;ab_channel=UbisoftUS)\n\ntoo lazy to link them, but Second Life and Star Citizen as well.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo the point is, this system would work well to group people together automatically who wanted to stay in character. People would of course manipulate the votes to get to high levels, but that could be dealt within many ways.\n\n\n\n\n"

6xl5uw,Star Wars Online l Open World MMO l A Concept Idea l Part 1,
6xk6bj,Here's my idea for a game!,"What about a game where you can wish for virtually anything you want?\n\nSound stupid? Well maybe.... Let me elaborate.\n\nThe idea in my head is a puzzle game that also has basic fighting/enemy mechanics.\nBasically you ' wish ' for the things you need to get past the puzzle/enemy.\n\nInventory size would be intentionally small, As a core mechanic would be to decide what you need/don't need at the time. I was thinking probably 2-5 slots MAX.\n\nThe ' wishing ' mechanic would be intentionally specific too. Like if you wished for a ' gun ' then you'd get a pretty normal gun ( Like a glock ) It wouldn't have bullets either, as you never wished for that. Also say with bullets, amounts would be key. Wishing for ' bullets ' would net you two bullets. Specifically stating say 5 bullets would net you 5. You could also take it a step further and have to dictate the type of bullets as well, But i feel that would become an annoyance.\n\nFor the puzzle side of wishing, Say you're at a point where you need to cross a river, If you wished for a plank of wood the you'd be able to cross. I feel it would be good if the mechanic worked realistically in the sense of what one person could actually carry. So plank of wood would work but wishing for a bridge wouldn't as you can't carry a proper bridge on you.\n\nThe story side is something I haven't really fleshed out. It's just the core mechanic I been thinking of. Although with a RPG style game I think it'd work well. Possibly adding limits to the amount of wishing per dungeon or something could be done as well.  \n\nI'd love to hear some thoughts on this. The games difficulty would come from the situations that could be created and the creative solutions that would be required to get past them.\n\nI actually thought of this idea based on Divinity: Original Sin and it's open-endedness for getting past bosses and other enemies, Sometimes getting past them is more about thinking than brute force or power.

6xjsgk,Streamer versus subscribers,"I would love to see a game where it is designed to be one person versus a large amount of other people.  preferably a scalable amount, so if you have 20v1 or 200v1 or 2000v1 it will still work.\n\nThere is a large amount of ways to make this work.\n\n\n----------\nOne idea that comes to mind is a game like ""SpyParty"". in spy party there is an assassin watching a party from another building. At the party is a bunch of NPCs and one human player who must complete various missions (look inside  a book for a message, contact another spy, switch a statue) and the assassin shoots the person they think is the spy.   If you had a similar game,  the streamer (say, pewdiepie) could be the spy and the viewers could vote on who the spy is. The doesn't quite work in this scenario because the streamer couldn't actually STREAM without giving away who they are..   Of the top of my head, make it so the streamers view in the game is just of the whole party and not just them so it doesn't give anything away.\n\nSpyParty wouldnt be fair with 200 people watching for one spy to do stuff, so the mechanics would have to be adjusted.\n\n----------\n\nSecond game type would be to have maybe a Mech in a city or a battle where this the mech versus many soldiers.\n the mech is the streamer and their hitpoints would scale up based on the number of opponents it faces.  You could make a lot of interesting things work with this.  Allow for plays to form squads and focus on an objective as a group, like targeting a leg, or like attack on titant where the neck is a weak spot.  Maybe allow a squad of five or ten to man a smaller mech as a group.  Whatever the mechanics are, doesnt really matter so much. The point is the streamer could announce they are playing, and 2000 people sign on and they all fight the one streamer as a group. itd be epic.\n\nmaybe you could allow two streamers to lead an attack against each other with big group.\n\n\n----------\n\nwhat other game types could pit a streamer against a large amount of their followers?"
6zycq2,An Original Music Based 2D Platform/Puzzle Game,"So, theres basic platform controls, jump, run, etc. Theres also enemies, and your attacks. But the originality comes from the way you attack. So you would have maybe 5 or more attacks (probably more) That would produce a different musical note from your character. The notes you play would perform different attacks that do different things to kill enemies to pass the puzzle. So you would  be playing cool little tunes to pull of cool combos (kind of like Magicka!) I wish I knew what to use or where to begin to pull this off, because if done correctly, to me it sounds pretty cool!"
6zps6l,Call of Duty:Future Warfare,"So basically I made a Google Slides Presentation on this, but I don't know how to link it. Anyways, here's my Idea, it's an AAA Instalment in the Call of Duty series, but here's the twist, made by Blizzard with help from Raven Software. So it's more like Overwatch than Call of Duty.\n\nBasically I want to do away with Ammo, and I want a futuristic game that isn't bad. And I think Blizzard created the perfect future game, if Overwatch was a COD:Title it would probably be the best Future Title in the series. \n\nSo here we go, basically, it will feature unlimited reloading ammo, vehicle classes that control similar to D.Va, Spider Tanks, MD Turrets(Returning from Advanced Warfare) and Quadcopters with Cockpits with recharging abilities like in Overwatch such as Rocket Salvo and stuff like that.\n\nBasically, I want Call of Duty to do away with Killstreaks and stuff and have Ultimate Abilities, Recharging Abilities and more Team-Based play instead. And I want a good Co-Op Campaign as well. With a plot that is about the UN facing an insurgency called the New League of Nations.\n\nBasically, returning features from previous and current COD Games would include Divisions and Mission Teams, they'll be combined, and will have their own individual headquarters, commanders and training courses. Vehicle, Sniper, Explosive, Infantry. 4 Divisions you can all join from the start.\n\nHowever, I need to find a way to pitch this idea to Blizzard or Activision, I suffer from Tourettes and Autism you see. And I'm not sure if this could work with them[The Conditions] both so I may need help when doing it. But it will be awesome, it will be the best Future COD Ever, and even with the new vehicle classes, it will be competitively balanced.\n\nWhat do you think? Any Ideas on how to make this work or something? Could it work?\n\nRE: It's not really a Rehash of Advanced Warfare. And I Know that Future Warfare was a trademark that Activision has had for years, mainly as a Placeholder for Advanced Warfare."
6zpo0i,Vampire The Masquerade: Bloodlines By Obsidian Entertainment,"Recently I've been playing VTMB and while i love the game, i wish i could have seen the finished product. What would it take for a company like Obsidian to pick up the license and make a new, finished game? The game has a fan audience who love the game and would practically market it for you, yet it's niche enough that they wouldn't even have to write a new story. The characters are already there and the format and gameplay would only have to be tuned a little.\n\nDisclaimer: I haven't finished the game so don't spoil it. I'm currently just past where you meet Heather Poe again."

6zkixk,"A horror game kind of like Outlast, but with a twist","The idea for this game (still unnamed) is that you play as a counselor at a summer camp. One night you wake to find your cabin completely empty. You rummage through your pack and find your cellphone, but alas, no service, but you remember there was a phone in the office on the other side of camp, deciding sooner rather than later to get help, you make your way across the grounds discovering quickly that you're not alone. A group of cannibals have made their way into the camp claiming that the land on which the camp is located rightfully belongs to them because their ancestors settled there and they will and have killed to get it back. Now for the twist: the only source of light you have is the screen of your cell. But the backlight timer (which controls how long the screen light stays on) is on, so the screen shuts off automatically during gameplay, even when running/hiding (I was thinking it'd be cool if with each difficulty the timer is lengthened a bit). The game consists of several different locations you have to go through to get to the office, including a lake, a pool house, and a cafeteria."

6zclf9,4D Game Idea,"I came up with an idea for a game that lets you move in four dimension, rather than three. I'm not talking about a time-travel game, but one where you actually slide along a fourth dimension as easily as you do the other three.\n\nThe idea is that your position is saved as four variables, let's call them w,playerX, playerY , and playerZ.\n\nThe game would store the terrain as a function. For example, |w|=(x-playerX)^(y-playerY)/(z-playerZ).\n\n\nYou'd see the terrain around you as the three-dimensional graph of the function with w, playerX, playerY, and playerZ substituted in and the player's position being the origin. w and s keys move you on the z axis, a and w move you on the z, e and q move you on the w axis. playerY is calculated from the other three. Moving along the w axis shifts the terrain into how it would be with the different w values.\n\nObjects in the world would have a set location along the w axis as well as the others. You can only see the object if your w location is, lets say, within 10 units of the object's w location, as well as being close in the other dimensions. It appears translucent when you're barely in sight of it, and more solid when you're closer. You can only interact with it if you're within 3 units of its w location, and you collide with it if you are within 2.\n\nThis is a very rough idea, but hopefully something could be made with this."

6z7f48,Left 2 Die,"Taking place in a pixelated version of what we're used to, you take the role of a random survivor who must make his or her way through the waves of zombies. Joining you in this journey is another playable character; they can be controlled by a local buddy, controlled online or by an A.I! When being controlled by an A.I, you can have it do 1 of 3 things.\n\n* Help!\nThis will have the A.I understand your situation and come to aid you, if the task at hand is to end in its death then it will not help unless it is helping towards an objective. They will ignore you if you are too far to reach. (unless if they are selfless then they'll risk them-self) \n\n* Attack!\nScreaming ""Attack"" will have the A.I attack any zombies coming near him, unlike the L4D2 Artificial Intelligence. He or She will instead not mess but will take time to deal the perfect shot, the teammate will not move from a point unless it important \n\n* Handle the Objective!\nThis is used for when you believe you can defend yourself better than they can, telling them to handle the objective will have them do the task though at points, they may need your help.  \n\nThis is a slower approach to the L4D universe, having the characters have a far more diverse moveset's. For example, they have the previously stated call-out buttons (Help! Attack! and Handle the Objective!). But they only can carry two weapons (1. Big Gun/Health Pack or 2. Melee Weapon/Small Gun/Grenade), these weapons are very effective but are often spread quite far apart unless if you are to go off the beaten path. Yes there are multiple paths, you can enter certain rooms or go down certain roads to get to the end of the map a different way but have a harder time! Speaking of maps...\n\n**Maps/Levels**\n\nThe maps work similarly to Left 4 Dead introducing the classic 4 acts per theme design where your two characters must make it to the end with one another, between each act. The characters reach a save point where their ammo is restocked but unlike a theme, each act isn't connected and usually just acts as a gauntlet of challenges. Interactions on a map differs depending on when the interaction takes place, who the characters are (i'll get to that).\n\n**Characters**\n\nYou can select two characters, this can affect the ending of the game leading to one of your characters death or to your teams victory. Certain A.I partners will pick up items which they believe will fit the situation better. Characters include 6 from the original games, 1 from the Japanese game and 3 new ones. \n\nThere are 4 key stats people should worry about, there's courage, sharpshooting skills, intelligence and speed, these four statistics will rank between 1 and 10. Plus survivors also get a single Special-Ability.\n\nHere's an example.\n\n    Test_Survivor\n* Courage: 6 (Slightly more than moderate) (This means that they will help more than they won't)\n* Sharpshooting: 2 (They lack expert aim leading to them unable to kill targets with a decisive head-shot)\n* Intelligence: 5 (Average) (The higher it is, the faster they figure out how to do objectives)\n* Speed: 2 (Meaningless) (They can't avoid fights or escape them as their speed will fail them when escaping but if too high, it could lead to the person going through things without thinking through)\n* Special Ability: Test_Example\nIf health is higher than 50% then they will gain extra speed points. (They mainly effect the four categories talked about above)\n\nIn the end, I give up. I just like the name and if they take the name and use it for a 2 player co-op 2D Adventure, I will love them."
6z5se7,a survival sim where you control a pride of lions,"Just had this idea today. The game will be called ""Pride"". You start off on a large hex grid with a lion and a few lionesses. The goal is to grow your dynasty, expand your territory, and survive for as long as possible. You control each lion or groups of lion at a time and have different actions depending on which lion you choose. Male lions can move the entire pride, mark new territory, and mate with female lions. Lionesses can form hunting parties and go on hunts where you select spaces with prey and select a target to hunt. Selecting a target to pursue has a lot of depth to it, for instace selecting a fast target is very risky because you have a high chance of failure, but if you do catch it you reduce the speed of the rest of the herd of prey. Cubs allow you to play and increase their stats for when the become adults. there are also lots of random events like rival lions trying to steal your lionesses and poachers trying to shoot your lions."
6z4hme,JRPG with story based on class or role choice.,"Imagine classic final fantasy. You begin the game, choosing 4 heroes with a list of roles for each one. But each role is not just a set of skills: it is a backstory and plot line for that character. For instance, your heroes might be a knight, rogue, mage, and ranger. The knight is from a noble family, and the main antagonist is that characters cousin. This leads to plot development that you would not have if you chose someone else. The rogue might be an ex-thieves guild member. So that characters story might give you access to a thieves den. A new dungeon to explore as well as plot. \n\nThat game is finished, so you start a new game without those two. So this play through will not have content that your last did. \n\nThis can lead to replayabilty, and I do not think it would be that hard to design if the mechanics and art are uniform and simple."
6z20l1,Indie Game Idea,"You play as the CEO, president, big bucks boss of some cliche omni corporation like in Robo Cop and everything is going smoothly. One night you go to a bar to get wasted and god strolls into the bar and tells you that you have x amount of time to live (I'm thinking a month since this is a short game with a lot of depth and replayability). The game revolves around what you, the world's shittiest businessman who leads a mega corporation that controls a lot of the worlds markets single handedly, will do with your time. Will you make a pill that cures cancer dirt cheap for people who need it and also punish the well being of your company because they didn't earn a profit for this pill that took money to make? The entire game would be full of decisions that you have to make, which determine the ending. Currently i'm picturing a monopoly ending, humanitarian ending, Steve Jobs ending (True ending where you help the world, your company doesn't sink, and god lets you live.), Zombie ending, Batman ending, etc etc. The point is i want this game to have a million possible outcomes and thousands of choices. The depth of player choice in this game is the sole factor in how popular it is. Also i don't want the morality of the game to be obvious, i don't like obvious evil (You kicked a puppy), good (You fed the puppy), and neutral (You let the puppy be) endings in games. I want you to go through the game tone deaf to any in game morality compasses leaving you to figure out what's right. This would make the game more interesting since you have to decide what's the good thing to do.\n\nTone-wise this game would be hilarious with the morality tucked behind the hilarity of it. When you make the aforementioned cancer pill and make it essentially free the game will tell you ""You cured cancer, saving lives all around the world, and everyone was a bit poorer for it"". That's the kind of vibe i picture this game to have, this way the morality isn't getting in the way of someone who wants to blow up the world. The writing should be snarky and just a little self aware to add to the hilarity of the game. You turn the world into zombies and the narrator says ""And (Your name here) turned the entire world into zombies... well isn't that cliche?"". The game is a hilarious experience but if you want to consider the morality of it then it can do that to very well.\n\nI'm thinking the format would be something like Wall Street Kid (Look up game grumps wall street kid), a step up from a text-based RPG but nowhere near say a PS1 game. It could also be a lot like Papers Please in how the game looks. But personally i like the idea of the Wall Street Kid format. That way when you unintentionally create a zombie apocalypse then you won't really see the impact of it until the ending screen.\nThoughts?"

6xez8e,Cartoon Chaos,"I've been thinking of a game that would tie together an old side-scroller, with the old cartoons I'd watch as a kid. Basically, you're a kid who gets stuck in the cartoon world. Your only weapon is a school backpack filled with a never ending supply of pencils, books, erasers, etc... for now.\n\nThe beginning feel should be like Toon Town from Who Framed Roger Rabbit, bright, cheerful, with some fun loving psychopathic toons who want you to join in their cheer, not knowing you wouldn't survive it. As you progress, the feel would darken into a Cool World/Monkey Bone atmosphere. The end level should be closer to Nightmare before Christmas, or Beetlejuice, and the last boss should look like the Winnie the Pooh nightmare, or like something from fantasia... Obviously, I'm not suggesting any copywrite infringement, just a general feel.\n\nAs I said, the only weapon you have is a bookbag filled with school supplies. This can be upgraded with points, or gold, and maybe some secret unlocks. You'll go from throwing books, to throwing pies (Silly), to bombs (Crazy), anvils (Insane), and grand pianos (Zany)... It's a cartoon...\n\nOne major aspect of the toon world I'd love to see in a video game is reactions, and activities unrelated to what's going on. For instance, a fight-tumbleweed could drift past you, with fists and feet sticking out, damaging you if it hits, or a baddie seeing that you just threw something, and their eyes bug out, their mouths open wide, and start running away, stuck in the same spot with a dust cloud at their feet.\n\nI was also thinking of mini-game coin-type rooms, like an ancient toon artifact that seems perfectly normal in the real world, teleportation you into a 'room'. I was thinking of something like a rubber room where you bounce off the floor, walls, and ceiling, a zero-G moon, or something with an Atari theme, like Kaboom (catching items into a basket)."

6x71fb,(MMO/Co-op)RPG with nostalgia skill system :),[deleted]
6x4u5g,A game about steamships,"So my idea is probably best compared to something like Spintires. Or maybe Elite: Dangerous, but without the combat. It would be a transportation game, set in the 1885-1913 period, and the vehicles of choice are steamships. Prepare for a fairly long and winded description.\n\n\n**Progression mechanics:**\n\nYou would start the game off with enough cash to purchase a ship from the beginning of the game's time period (ca. 1885). A few different models would be available, including some steam-barques and other wooden-hulled ships. Each model would have a unique capacity for cargo space and passenger space. This would be a customisable ratio to some degree, so you could choose to convert certain ""optional"" compartments from cargo space to passenger accomodations. Or vice-versa. This couldn't be done on the fly, though. You'd either have to specify this ratio in the initial order placed for your ship when you purchase it, or you would have to take your ship to a proper shipyard later on to have this work done aftermarket.\n\nOnce you've chosen a ship, you would start by running potpourri cargo between random ports. Some starting steamships would be better-suited to long-distance journeys, while others would be more profitable in island-hopping. For example, you might start the game by purchasing a fast, shallow-draft coastal barque, which would allow you to quickly run smaller amounts of on-demand cargo between Caribbean ports for a high profit. Or you might decide instead to purchase a higher-capacity blue-water tramp steamer, which would be better at running larger amounts of cargo between major ports up and down the Americas, or maybe even transatlantic runs.\n\nOnce you've accrued enough money, you'll be approached by some of the major shipping companies of the era (White Star, Cunard, Leyland, HAPAG, NDL, etc.) with contracting offers. They'll pay you a relatively small initial fee to fly their pennant aboard your ship, which will give you certain bonuses for carrying certain types of cargo between certain ports. Your ship will also fly the flag of the nation in which that shipping company has its headquarters (no real gameplay effect from this, just cosmetic). So if you sign on with, say, Hamburg-Amerika Linie, then your ship will fly the HAPAG pennant from the mainmast and the Schwarz-Weiß-Rot of the German Empire from the jackstaff.\n\n\n**Open world and resource generation:**\n\nThe world is massive. It's a 1:1-scale recreation of Earth, all its oceans and waterways. Most of them are navigable, though very few of the ships in the game can manage to travel up rivers since a shallow draft is required for that.\n\nThe resource generation is specific based on region. So different ports around the world will provide different goods to trade. Each unique kind of good would have certain kinds of ports where it would sell better. For example, food (fruit, cured meats, crops) would sell fairly well in most every port, but the maximum profit wouldn't be that high as a result. More specialized cargo, like precious metals, would sell well in only a few ports around the world, but it would be extremely profitable if you could make the journey with a large amount of it.\n\nPassengers would work somewhat similarly. They would generate according to a port's size and affluence. So a small port would generate a relatively small number of passengers, suitable for a tramp steamer or perhaps a schooner or steam yacht. But to be profitable in a larger ship, you would have to frequent the larger ports. Making sure you fill your accommodations as much as possible is a big deal in offsetting operating costs for your ship.\n\nYou'd also have to consider the average affluence of a port. The way passengers board a ship works according to their wealth: if a port is more affluent, a larger percentage of the available passengers will purchase second and first-class tickets. If the port is less affluent, more will settle for the default steerage (third class) accomodations.\n\nThis also means that when you order/outfit your ship, you should consider what ratio of accomodations to fit it with. If you're taking a smaller steam yacht, perhaps you plan on being hired out for private journeys by the super-rich. A larger tramp steamer would be able to carry more passengers, but it would be locked to steerage and second-class compartments (again, each ship has unique outfitting abilities. Only ship classes that historically had first-class accomodations can have them in the game). A very large liner would be able to carry all types of passengers, but you'd still have to worry about ratios of passenger accomodations and the ratio of overall passenger space to cargo space.\n\n\n**Ship selection:**\n\nAvailable ships would span the period 1885-1913. Multiple classes of different sizes and purposes would be available. Ships would be available only at ports with shipyards, which would only be a relative few around the world (maybe ~100 or so ports out of the thousands available in the world).\n\nEach shipyard would have a unique selection of ship designs available, analogous to the historical ships that shipyard actually constructed. For example, the Kaiser-class liner would be unique to Vulcan Stettin AG.\n\nShips wouldn't have any upgrades available. They would only be customisable in the way of their internal arrangements, as mentioned above (ratio of passenger accommodation types, ratio of overall passenger space to bulk cargo space).\n\n\n**Basic gameplay:**\n\nThe game's controls would be simple. Not very sim-like, though the ships themselves would handle very realistically. The engines would be controlled by engine telegraph, so you'd have 4 forward speeds and 4 reverse speeds. Rudder would be much the same: 4 notches to the left and 4 to the right.\n\nCollisions and damage would be possible, and it could sink you if severe enough.\n\nYour top speed would be somewhat reduced in rough weather. Storms with large waves would slow your ship quite a bit.\n\nChat in multiplayer would be through wireless telegraph, which would work similarly to proximity chat in other games. The range at which your signals could be heard would be based on the range of your telegraph system, which would differ depending on your ship. \n\nLarge liners with extremely long radio aerials would be capable of telegraph communication over hundreds of miles. Smaller ships would have much shorter ranges. This could lead to interesting situations in which a ship may send out a signal, but no audible reply is heard even though such a reply has been sent.\n\n\n**Multiplayer time-passage mechanics:**\n\nBecause the world is so large, 1:1-scale time wouldn't make any sense at all for even a relatively short journey. So here's the system I've devised: when closer to populated areas (ports, for instance) or player-controlled ships, the player is forced to slow to 1:1 time. This persists until the ships are a certain distance away from each other (outside of their mutual exclusion zones). But when the player reaches a certain distance from any populated area or player-controlled ship, they may speed time up to a max of about x150 or so.\n\nOf course, you'd always have the option of slowing it down at any time. You could, if you really wanted to, set a course for your ship and come back later that day to find it still traveling in that direction.\n\nDay-night cycles would also be universal, so all players would have the same terminator line displayed across their respective globes. This means that if one player were to travel at max speed from east to west (or vice-versa), they might notice the time of day change significantly in less than an hour. \n\nThere would be no date system in multiplayer. So all ships in the entire period of 1885-1913 would be available to all players from the creation of the game server. To make each ship worth consideration, the costs would be scaled accordingly. That is, older ships would be much cheaper and easier to maintain for anyone just beginning the game.\n\n\n**Graphics expectations:**\n\nThe game would be played in third-person. You'd be able to use a free camera to move around your ship, and even underwater to view the ship's keel.\n\nThe graphics would be beautiful and extremely detailed. Individual rivets would be visible on the ship hulls. Waves, smoke and steam would be generated dynamically (prow waves would be larger when a ship goes faster; larger ships would leave larger wakes; larger, more powerful engines would leave more frothing water behind their screws; the wind conditions would cause the water surface to look different, would change the consistency of smoke coming from a funnel, etc.).\n\nWeather and day-night cycles would be fully modeled. Storms would leave your deck glistening with rainwater and sea-spray, and your ship would pitch in the waves accordingly. Lightning might appear in the skybox, dynamically lighting the scene and your ship from that direction.\n\nYour ship's exterior and main interior lights would turn on as night falls. After dusk, your ship's passenger compartment portholes would be lit (the number of lit compartments would depend on the number of passengers aboard). A large ship might look like a well-lit, floating hotel by sunset.\n\n\n**Damage:**\n\nDamage modelling would also be present. If a ship collided with another, the ships would display appropriate damage for the situation: a ship plowing into a stationary one would have its bow crushed in, while the stationary ship would have a gash cut in its side. Collision with a reef would cause jagged cuts below the waterline, and beaching a ship would cause the bottom to warp inwards slightly in addition to some minor cracks.\n\nScrews could be thrown on rare occasion. It would depend on the last time you had your ship examined in drydock, which should be something you do after a certain cumulative distance has been traveled. The game would keep track of your total mileage, telling you when it's time for that service checkup. If you go over the scheduled checkup mile-count without getting your ship into drydock, each mile further that you travel increases the likelihood of a screw being thrown.\n\n\n**Further ideas?**\n\nLet's face it, this game will probably never be made. But hey, if anyone has any ideas, feel free to post them below. And if you got this far, thanks for bothering to read all of that! Here, have a [cookie](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6e/Pepperidge-Farm-Nantucket-Cookie.jpg)."
6x4ocy,Viking Warrior RPG,"You would play as a Viking warrior and be able to join a crew and perform raids on towns, monasteries, etc. This would earn you gold which you could use to buy/make your own ship and form a crew. You could explore the Viking territories and go on quests for different people in Viking towns. There would be a storyline but you don't have to follow it. \n\nYou would also have the option to join in a war against a European Country and take over land. You could use this land to create an army and conquer more land. \n\nIf you gather enough followers and warriors you could start a revolution against the chieftain of a village and take control of it. You could seek to unite the Vikings and conquer Europe.\n\nAnother option might be going to America with Leif Erikson or as your own expedition and exploring there. You could go to Iceland, Greenland, and all the other countries and lands the Vikings ventured to. Joining Erik the Red is also an option.\n\nAnother possible route might be to join a quest involving a Viking myth or god. You could go fight sea monsters or dragon and earn gold/xp that way. \n\nAs you keep leveling up you would be able to travel farther and farther away from your hometown and explore new areas. I was also thinking of incorporating something with Valhalla. "
6x1khu,Step-based RPG for mobile,"Okay so I had this idea and I wanted to see what the reception was, because if it seems like something that would interest people then I might try and make it :/\n\nEssentially, it's a pedometer mixed with an RPG. Imagine something like Skyrim but every time you had to travel across the land to get to a quest point, you had to walk that far irl (except reasonable distances).\n\nObviously, this wouldn't be a game you sit down and play, it's more of something to have in the background to encourage walking.\n\nFor example, you're in a city and hear at the inn that some monsters have been terrorizing a nearby settlement. You open the map, and select that settlement as your travel destination. Let's say it's a mile away. Now, the app tracks your steps and once you've walked a mile, you'll get a notification like ""You have arrived at &lt;location&gt;!"" and now you play a quick battle minigame or something. Then, you walk back to claim your reward.\n\nThere could be dungeons and quests and all sorts of things, but the main mechanic would be the traveling.\n\nEDIT: If you have a cool mechanic idea I'd love to hear it. Something like you get stopped along your journey by a thief or bandit or something and have to play a quick battle before you can continue traveling towards your destination."
6ww7pe,"Factorio-like game, with city-building (Zeus), RPG-like fighting, Farming (harvest moon), commerce (Recettear) elements.","Writing the title I realize it sounds impossible to do right, since it would be impossibly huge and time-consuming to make, but I really, REALLY want to play this, and I will probably never get around to actually make it (even though I want to at least try eventually, and go as far as I can), so maybe someone reads the idea and will attempt making it too.\n\nNow for the details:\n\nYou would have to mine, extract, and gather all the resources you need to build things, like in factorio, and can automate everything.\n\nThere is a basic crafting system, like in factorio, and you can research new blueprints/recipes to build new things, or buy them from other cities/players/whatever.\n\nTech tree to unlock things, and improve stats.\n\nOnce you have a production line for gathering, refining, and building things, you can actually build a city, like in a city-building game, my favorite of all times is Zeus: Master of Olympus, so I'll use that as the standard for this part of the game.\n\nBasically, build a city, let citizens get in, improve it, defend it, trade, grow the economy, and so on.\n\nThe money of the city is separete from your own money, and it's collected through taxes, and exports.\nYou can spend your own money to improve the city, or the city's money, but you can't take\nthe city's money for yourself.\n\nYou can either manage the whole city, or just yourself, and let the city work automatically.\nSo you can build farms for the city, and let them work automatically, or build a farm and manage it yourself, like in Stardew Valley/Harvest Moon.\n\nSelling the things you've built/gathered/harvested can be as simple as Stardew Valley, when you just get the base value of the item (low), or you can build a shop in the city to sell the items yourself and get a much higher value (like in Recettear).\n\nYou can also trade with other cities, sell things you have in eccess, and buy things that you lack.\nActually I got the urge to play this game by looking at this:\n\nhttp://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/usa/\n\nI want the possibility to make many things, export and import them depending on need and availability, and seeing the variety of things that get imported and exported really made me want to play a game where I can do that.\n\nAlso, I want most things to have a purpose, not just be something you have to sell, but something you could consider keeping/using, so that there is an incentive to import things that you don't have.\nFor example, having many different kinds of food will be beneficial to the health of the citizens,\nsome foods will be more valuable than others as they'll last more in storage, or will not require cold storage,\nsome foods will be likelier to make people obese, or cause other health issues, and so on.\nMechanical parts can be used to build different things.\nResources like metals, wood, and oil can be used for what you'd expect them to be used for, and so on,\nbasically most things have some kind of use.\n\nThen of course you would also be able to fight. A simple fighting system, like in Stardew Valley/Harvest Moon/Recettear is fine, but a slightly more complex RPG fighting system would be nice, maybe like in Golden Sun, but with more items equippable, like in Diablo games (and of course you would be able to build the items yourself, or find them in dungeons).\n\nSo yeah, that's about it.   \nIt's a Frankenstein's monster, it's massive, and it will probably never be made the way I want it, but I'm going to try anyway some day, or hopefully someone will read this and make it.\n\nEdit: Added some things."

6wnclk,Story game about a soldier struggling with war,"This just popped into my head while playing the MW3 campaign. The idea is a young soldier who got caught up in the glory of war from video games and movies and finds out the truth when he gets there himself. It would most likely be a dialogue heavy game with player made choices.\n\nIt would start off like some campaign from a COD game or something, with the training and such, making the player expect another COD campaign essentially... and then the character is deployed somewhere.\n\nWhen the character finally gets into the battlefield, everything is different than the video games and movies. His friends dying around him, things going wrong, etc. \n\nThere could be some character vs self conflict, maybe he has to choose between killing an injured enemy or something, as well as some internal conflict with his fellow soldiers.\n\nI just thought it would be interesting, and while I'm sure there are games similar (as there seems to always be) I couldn't think of one off the top of my head. Feel free to use the idea I'm just putting it out there. I didn't write any dialogue or anything, I'm trying not to be too constricting. Thanks!"
6wl633,Political power game based on the demise of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth,"You would play as the kings and try to stop the PLC from being weakened to the point that all three of its neighbors could erase it from the map. It would start at 1619 and end at 1795, from its greatest extent to its nonexistence. The main actions of the game would be pleasing nobles to help pass laws while not angering the other nobles to out right refusing to work with you which would stall reforms, keeping a balanced budget and military, and your neighbors from joining together to destroy the kingdom. (As well as trade, urbanization, and science/culture)\n\nIt would be like Long Live the Queen, except instead of trying to stop yourself from being killed you try to stop your kingdom from dying."

At the office there would papers which addresses issues and letters from other leaders. You can settle issue by senders ministers or etc. or you can go settle the issues with your own hand. You'll need to maintain popularity and suppor from the people by settling issue or choosing a side in international conflicts e.g. Palestine-Israel, China-Taiwan, Pakistan-India and etc. But after an amount of time you need to leave presidency unless you manage to extend your term or make yourself as the president for life.\n\nThis idea cam because most game that makes you lead a country either end up controlling the country and you leader death doesn't matter like EU4 or you have an eternal leader that survive from 4000 BC to 2000 AD like Civilisation 5.

6wg3xe,"Rolling Thunder: A modern, team based, PVP, Tank Crew Simulator.","Rolling Thunder \n\n(On mobile, obligatory apology for formatting)\n\nSo my idea is for a Tank Crew Simulation called ""Rolling Thunder""\nIt's a Guns of Icarus style tank warfare game, and It's all first person to ensure realism.\nIt can be Player v. Computer or maybe Player v. Environment, but the primary focus is PvP team battles.\n\nYou have a team of 20: 4 tanks (3 normal tanks, 1 lead tank), 5 tankers each.\n\nEach tank has a:\nCommander\nDriver\nGunner\nLoader\nDamage controlman\n\nEach do their jobs and if a crewman dies for some reason, positions can be changed to compensate.\n\nCommander:\ncan view 360 degrees around the tank in the commanders seat, gives commands to all crewmembers, and has battlefield data and maps, and access to a laser designator and gps points. Laser being used for pointing for the gunner, and gps points for the driver.\n((Commander of Command tank can also place GPS markers for other commanders and send orders directly))\n\nDriver:\ndrives (duh) and has GPS access.\n\nGunner:\nMain cannon, coaxial MG, and (if mounted) has access to tertiary weapon systems(I.e. TOW Missles) and access to gun sights/camera so they can see where the commander is pointing with the laser as well as aim.\n\n\nLoader:\n loads and keeps track of ammunition. Loads co-ax gun if needed, hand loads shells and picks between special and standard shells depending on what the commander needs.\n(This includes Regular rounds, Depleted uranium rounds, Armor Piercing SABOT rounds, chalk rounds(bright orange to visually mark enemies), Glow rounds (Visual marker at night), High Explosive rounds, and phosphorus (tracer) rounds to.) \n\nDamage control: \nKeeps eye on computer systems and maintains as needed. Engine and computer problems are solved internally, and outside repairs can be done with team when needed. Also controls defense systems, like missile countermeasures, flares, and IR smoke. Can Initiate track repair (if treads are damaged) and armor panel repair on outside of vehicle.\n\nThe multiplayer will be like regular multiplayer in most games. Random matchmaking unless you have a party, and if you have a party, you stay in the same ""Squad"". You have a preferred role set at all times (similar to Payday 2s Character preference) but it's totally first come first serve if someone with your preferred role drops into the lobby first.\nOnce the game is populated, you are sent into the ""WARNO""(military acronym) screen where you optimize your role (loader fills in ammo slots with specific ammo, gunner optimizes guns, DamCon chooses defense options, driver optimizes tank performance, commander sets tank appearance, armor type, and reads over mission. \nCommand tank Commander  can be heard by his crew and other commanders and set radio frequencies, mission routes, specific tank routes, and rally points (if necessary)\n\nLead Commander can also acquire support assets that come with team points and tank points (special assets that can be acquired by earning points.) Overall team points can access drone missile strikes, Artillery barrages, and other large support assets.\nTank points are individual points scored by individual tanks that access small support assets like UAV Targeting (Gives commanders locations of enemy tanks) ammunition drops(including special ammunition), extra armor plating, and other small support elements.\n\nWhen finished in the WARNO screen, The commander names their tank before entering battle, and that will be used as sort of a ""ready"" button for the commander. \n\nMuch like GTAs gangs, Ghost Recon Wildlands ""Task Forces"", Battlefields ""Platoons"", etc etc,\nYou can have a ""Tank Squad""(finished name pending)  that you can invite friends to, and it will have a name much like the above games special groups have. Like how your GTA gang has a name. So if you create a ""Tank Squad"" for you and your friends to be under, when you are in a game with them, and one of you is the commander, the in-game  tank will automatically take the name of your squads Tank and automatically set name and appearance.\n\nYou can choose a basic look for your avatar as well, just to have something to look at in game or in victory/loss /loading screens (characters sitting in/on/around tank, or characters outside of tank fixing tank or playing objective during gameplay).\nYour character will be fully covered as to not need skin color, and body types will be male or female. Camo and body armor (basically if helmets or body armor vests are worn or not) is decided by commander during WARNO Phase.\n\nGame modes are simple:\n--Team death match (one life per round, plays like small scale World of Tanks)\n--Capture the flag (3 respawns per tank per team)\n--Attackers v. Defenders (attackers get 5 lives, defenders get 3) \n--Sector control (fight over one area at a time, 2-3 lives per sector per tank, drive other team out to advance towards enemy HQ, sectors can be taken back.)\n\n\nAnd that's all I've got, what do y'all think?\n\nEdit: Other Lead Commander abilities.\n Edit2: added specific ammunition types."

6wdoff,Verticality of Resurgence,"Verticality of Resurgence is a game idea that I’ve had for a while and something I probably will never work on (I have a snap map that sort of plays like this), but I think you guys would get a kick out of this anyways. Verticality of Resurgence would be a first person shooter with a low poly graphical style like SUPER HOT and basic Pseudo-RPG elements.\n\nSo for a start the game would have a system where every 2-4 kills, you’ll receive a key; you’ll be able to hold a maximum of six keys; however this resets if you dies. You will have a 50% chance of losing a single key when you die. Keys allow you to get different things such as benders and technics.\n\n- Base Inventory and Basic Abilities\n\n- Can hold 2 guns\n\n- 100 HP\n\n- Movement speed is 4.5 m/s (Running speed is 5.5)\n\n- Jump 1.5 meter\n\n- Can jump against a wall and push off\n\n- 3 grenade slots\n\n- 3 bender slots\n\n- 1 tesseract slot\n\n- Hatchet (25 damage per swipe)\n\n-Guns-\n\nGuns will be scattered around the map (8 in total) which will then despawn and a new gun will spawn in its place. When you start out, you’ll only have a knife and two grenades. Picking up a gun will not cost any keys. Guns are sorted into 4 different tiers, with each one slightly differing with the types of guns in them. When you die, deending on the tier, you’ll have a different chance of losing the gun. Tier 1 is 0%, tier 2 is 25%, tier 3 is 50%, and tier 4 is 75%. (Headshots do double damage)\n\nTier 1: Bowie Barker (Pistol) (Clip 5, pool 25, 3 damage per shot), Antics (Shotgun) (Clip 3, pool 21, 5 damage per shot), Leadslinger (Sniper) (clip 2, pool 8, 15 damage per shot), Downer (Machine Gun) (clip 30, pool 150, 1.5 damage per shot)\n\nTier 2: Sapphire Shot (Shotgun) (clip 8, pool 24, 5 damage per shot), Blackout (Machine Gun) (clip 25, pool 125, 3 damage per shot), Blowback (Rocket Launcher) (Clip 1, pool 4, 50 damage per shot), Marauder (Shotgun) (Clip 2, pool 14, 15 damage per shot)\n\nTier 3: Panzer Blast (Shotgun) (Clip 6, pool 24, 20 damage per shot) Dusk_Ops (Railgun) (Clip 3, pool 9, damage 25 per shot), Sentinel (Pistol) (Clip 6, pool 24, damage 12 per shot) Dynamite (Rocket Launcher) (Clip 3, pool 12, damage 45 per shot)\n\nTier 4: Scoff (Shotgun) (Clip 4, pool 16, damage 25 per shot) Tier Tower (Light Machine Gun) (Clip 100, pool 200, damage 2 per shot), Mr. Twins (Pistol, Duel Wield) (Clip 6 per gun, pool 30, damage 10 per shot) Glitch Blade (Sword) (75 damage per slash)\n\n\n\n\n\n-Benders-\n\nBenders are effects which give you an edge in the arena. They come in 3 tiers, with the initial being 2 and increases by 1 for each tier. There will be 2 spots on the map where you can get benders which’ll change the bender every 1-3 minutes. You can only have 3 benders at a time. When killed, there is a 45% chance 1 of your bender will be set back a tier (unless it’s at tier 1), a 30% chance that two will be set back a tier, and a 15% chance all of them will be set back a tier.\n\nNinja\n\nTier 1: secondary grenade type (smoke grenades.)      Tier 2: Can see enemy players from a short distance through walls.      Tier 3: Holding the run button down while idle will cloak you (Only lasts for 5 seconds before needing to recharge).\n       \nJumping Jack\n\nTier 1: Double Jump      Tier 2: 6 m/s run instead of 4.5, running speed is 7 m/s      Tier 3: 3 Second Wall Run      \n\nSoldier\n\nTier 1: 50% extra health      Tier 2: 50% extra health      Tier 3: 50% extra damage\n\nBombadier\n\nTier 1: 50% less splash damage from your own weapons      Tier 2: Grenades do 50% extra damage      Tier 3: Last bullet in the clip of any gun causes an explosion\n\nCowboy\n\nTier 1: 50% faster reload speed      Tier 2: Take 50% Less damage while reloading      Tier 3: 25% faster fire rate\n\nSharpshooter\n\nTier 1: Can run while aiming down the sight      Tier 2: 25% extra damage while aiming      Tier 3: players give off a dull glow while aiming\n\nScavnger\n\nTier 1: get 5% extra ammo after killing someone      Tier 2: 5% chance that a player that you kill will drop 2 keys      Tier 3: Can carry a third gun\n\n-Tesseract-\n\nA Tesseract is a special weapon that lasts 15 seconds and requires 2, 4, or 6 keys depending on the weapon. If killed while wielding the weapon, you will not respawn with it.\n\nSlugger (Machine Gun) (2 keys)\n\n100 ammo, 5 ammo per shot\n\nBow of Smite (4 keys)\n\n25 ammo, 25 damage per shot\n\nSkull Shot (Minigun) (4 keys)\n\nInfinite ammo, 10 damage per shot\n\nSpray N’ Pray (Flamethrower) (6 keys)\n\nInfinite Ammo, 15 damage per second of being engulfed (Still on fire 3 seconds after initial exposure)\n\n-Ammo and Health Boxes-\n\nAmmo and Health boxes do not cost any keys and can be picked up for free. The boxes come in four different colors (Yellow, Cyan, Purple, and Orange.) Yellow replenishes 25% of health or ammo. Cyan replenishes 50% of health or ammo. Purple Replenishes 75% of health or ammo, and orange replenishes 100% of health or ammo.\n\n-Game modes-\n\nThere would be 5 game modes for the game\n\n- Deathmatch\n\n10 minute game, whoever gets the most kills within that time wins\n\n- Team Deathmatch\n\nSame as last gamemode but there are teams and kills from the entire team determines who wins\n\n- Mayhem\n\nTeam gamemode where one team must defend a large robot and the enemy team tries to destroy it\n\n- Vertigo\n\nA team game mode where the water level on the map is constantly rising, the object of the game is to keep your entire team over the water. Touching the water is a permanent kill for whoever touches it.\n\n- Mind the gap\n\nFree for all but the floors are constantly moving and turrets will appear randomly for 15 seconds\n"

6w9o79,Some ideas to improve my space game?,"I've been working for almost 5 years on an open source local multiplayer space game in which each player's computer acts as one of the stations on a shared starship bridge. It's a similar idea as Artemis Spaceship Bridge Simulator, in the basic idea, but very different in all the details. I've gotten pretty far with it, but am starting to run out of ideas.  Here's what I have working so far:\n\n* Proper 3D - your ship is free to travel in any direction and orient itself in any way.\n* Navigation Station - From here you drive the ship. Impulse drive for slow travel, warp drive for fast travel. Orbit planets, dock with space stations to repair and resupply the ship, orient the ship so the weapons can face any threat that might be present.\n* Weapons station - 3D turret view with laser fire and torpedo fire.  (More millenium falcon style than star trek style.)\n* Engineering station - Manage power and coolant distribution to the various systems on the ship, control the shields.\n* Damage control station - repair the ships systems by manually driving a robot (or put the robot in autonomous mode and it will drive itself and repair the ship itself, though not as well as can be done manually.)\n* Science station with short and long range scanners, tractor beam, waypoints. Detect range and closing speed to scanned objects. Get information about planets, asteroids, and other ships. Launch the mining robot.\n* Comms - Communicate with starbases to buy and sell cargo, arrange for docking, passenger pickup and dropoff. Communicate with ""the computer"" to control almost all aspects of the ship in english (e.g. you can type ""/computer set a course for the nearest starbase"" and it will do it.) Project any bridge station's screen onto the ""main view"" (see below).  Communicate with the mining robot to give it commands. Communicate (chat) with other player ships.\n* Main view - This is an out the window 3D rendering meant to be projected on a big screen in front of everyone.\n* Game master screen - This allows a game master to inject various things in to the universe to entertain the other players, and helps in setting up mission scripts (see below). \n* Lua scripting - various mission scripts can be made with a Lua based scripting system.\n* Multi-bridge play - multiple bridges (starships) can be active at once, so player controlled ships can cooperate, or fight against each other.\n* Multiple servers can run different shards or ""solar systems"", and player ships can transit between them by buying tickets from starbases to use the ""jump gates"" and there is a ""star map"" that defines a network of the jump gates through which players travel.\n* Speech recognition. You can talk to ""the computer"" and control almost all aspects of the ship simply by requesting the computer to do what you want, i.e. just say, ""Computer, set the warp drive power to 97 percent."" and it does it.\n* Procedurally generated planets (though it is offline, not in game).\n\nSome ideas I've partially implement but aren't done yet:\n\n* Space monsters\n* Large death-star-like-or-borg-cube-like ships\n\nSome ideas I've thought of but discarded:\n\n* No Video chat -- while it would be nice, I'm not really too interested in re-implementing skype, too hard, too bandwidth intensive.\n* No Internet play -- too bandwidth intensive.  Each station requires about 100kbytes/sec, and the game is to a large extent a social game and needs the players to be in the same room.\n* No Landing on planets -- this is a social co-op game at its core.  it's supposed to be like you're physically on the bridge of a starship with your crew mates.  Landing on planets doesn't really work with that idea (unless VR, but, no).\n* No VR - No, this thing is niche enough already without requiring (even more) hardware that nobody has.\n\nSo far so good, but, I'm kind of running out of ideas to some extent, hence why I'm here.\n\nWhat are some good ideas for scripted scenarios?  Turns out Outer Space is kind of bland and empty, terrain-wise. So it's hard to come up with ideas for missions that aren't ""go investigate that wreck that happens to be a trap and enemies will appear and come out shooting.""  I have once scenario in which a planet is being attacked, and you have to go shoot the attackers, another in which you have to recover and deliver a vaccine to a starbase suffering from an outbreak of space pox, and another unfinished scenario which is more or less, ""please kill the big giant death machine bearing down on an innocent planet"". Other ideas?\n\nWhat are some good specific ideas for each of the stations? I think my navigation station is pretty good, it's got a cool attitude indicator with some elements borrowed from the some Apollo hardware (pitch, yaw and roll rate indicators) and is nicely hooked into the sensor system so when sensors get damaged, you get some cool looking flickering and degradation. Engineering is a little bland, with sliders and indicators for power and coolant for each system of the ship (shields, phasers, comms, sensors, impulse, warp drive, maneuvering, tractor beam, life support) but seems like it could use some more stuff, somehow.\n\nOther ideas you might have for a game like this that I didn't think to ask about?\n"

716mt2,Fantasy Naval Combat,"Think Assassin's Creed Black Flag meets World of Warcraft. You've got your basic ship and player combat, but everything has a fantasy twist.\n\nYou can pick one of Six countries, Eldunar (Ambitious humans) Phethk (Industrious Trolls and Goblins), Huuthi (Tribal Dwarves), Qiakua (Sophisticated Elves), Randis (Powerful Beast People), or the the little isle of Sanctuary (Diverse Pirates). \n\nYou start off in your country's hub city and need to find a ship that's hiring. Outside of combat gameplay largely consists of you climbing the rigging and following your captains orders to the letter. Different countries have different ships which will have you doing different things depending on where you choose to start.\n\nShips vary greatly in size, from small magically powered skiffs to huge cargo ships. You can control them all, or let someone else do the steering so you can do things like set up the cannons, or throw grappling hooks. \n\nAt any time out at sea you can test your luck and try to get a mutiny going. If successful you join the Pirate faction, and now command the ship you were working on. At this point you'll need to return to Sanctuary from now on to collect rewards and connect with other players \n\nIf unsuccessful you get locked in the brig and gain no rewards from the expedition. Speaking of exploring, that would be one of the bigger draws of this game. \n\nI imagine a semi-stylized art style, that brings a sense of fantasy to the ships and characters, but also sense of daunting realism when it comes to the water and landscapes, I just have this image of your ship careening down a 300ft wave. And who knows maybe there's even an underwater city to find, my point is exploration as well as combat will be a big part of the games foundation.\n\nIdeally this game is multiplayer, possibly an MMO, but I don't know enough about those to really say for sure if that would work. "
715nl6,"Regimental HQ simulator game, heavy focus on giving orders through radio commands, maps, and visual feeds or riding to the front line.","I have this idea of a military management game where you play as an officer commanding a military unit that could be used to play any conflict possible if you were able to mod it in. You can assign your unit (We'll call it a regiment for now) officers, enlisted, and equipment and that would change the modifiers of your regiment based on your play style. You could tailor your brigade to become mountaineers, paratroopers, commandos, marines, and even the best crack troops. You could tackle many missions at once, given the rank you hold is sufficient to command more than one. How you would go about them could be up to you, you will often be given information of the area and the enemies but there will be time whens your supplies are low, the bad guys are close, and your recon plane is shot down. Without visual info, you'll have to rely on your radio and runners to accurately relay your important messages. \n\nJust to sum up, a cool single player commander simulator, where you can actually do everything you should be able to do as a commander. "
714hbo,Haunted House Tower Defense,"After reading Richard Matheson's *Hell House*, I had an idea for a tower-defense style game.\n\n**Name:** Defense of Heck House\n\n**Concept Overview:** \n\n* A 3D tower-defense style-game where you are a malevolent entity haunting a house, wishing to defend it against trespassers. Possibly isometric.\n\n**Plot:**\n\nAn ancient ancestral manse was the home of an eccentric millionaire occultist. One night, fueled by a demonic rage, he went on a killing spree, killing family, servants, and acolytes. However, before he could kill his final victim, his most powerful apprentice, this apprentice bound his soul to the manse before escaping into relative obscurity.\n\nYou are that eccentric millionaire, now a malevolent spirit inhabiting a haunted mansion. Pesky paranormal investigators, college kids, and other annoying trespassers keep coming by, and you wish it would stop, so you make use of your malevolent powers to add hauntings and traps to your house. Defeating trespassers gains you more power, which can either increase your domain (it's a stately estate with gardens, greenhouses, and even a family cemetery) or add more traps. Trespassers getting into your inner sanctum weakens you, and if they successfully perform an exorcism, it's game over, man.\n\n**Setting:**\n\nIt takes place in a haunted mansion complete with all the tropes therein. Since the house has an occult history, there's also several points of energy throughout, which, as you gain more power, you also must inhabit and defend. There's a greenhouse, a cemetery, a guest house, a cathedral, and a topiary with a hedge maze, among other things.\n\n**Characters:**\n\n* Benedictus Sylvestrus - The spirit of the eccentric millionaire, your character.\n\n* June Julius - His most powerful apprentice. She has a grudge to settle with Sylvestrus, and wishes to atone for her past dabbling in the occult.\n\n* Various parodies of paranormal investigators and other horror film tropes (and possibly a knockoff Scooby gang).\n\n**Gameplay Mechanics:**\n\nYou start with a limited range, say, a portion of the mansion. Regular waves if trespassers of increasing difficulty try to inhabit the house, either to study it (paranormal investigators), party (college students), or get rid of the evil (June and her acolytes), and possibly other reasons. So, each wave will have different objective endpoints, and if they stay too long or reach their objective, you get weakened. The weaker you get, the easier it will be to exorcise you.\n\nFortunately, you can add traps (trap doors, swinging axes, etc.) and hauntings (ghosts, monsters, etc.) to help defend your sanctum sanctorum. A different type of defense mechanism may affect the health or the sanity of the trespasser, rendering them either dead or insane. Some trespassers may try to escape after a certain level of threat is experienced. Those that die on the property become ghosts which can be used for various hauntings, or can be traded for upgrades. Those that go mad simply run about the mansion (and grounds) causing mayhem, both to your stuff and to the trespassers. If they die, they become malevolent spirits, which are like the regular ghosts with a buff.\n\nDifferent trespassers will have different inherent defenses, like priests may be immune to temporary possession, or college students may have a higher level of defense against toxic substances (you know, 'cause alcohol). Also, they'll leave behind ghosts of different abilities and powers. Trespassers with a low spirit score will typically yield zombies instead (no soul to speak of). All mobs, whether derived from trespassers or bought can be deployed or assigned certain tasks (like, ""patrol"" or ""stand ground"" or ""hide here until somebody walks by"").\n\nYou win if you can successfully defeat June (she'll come after enough waves of her Juliites (pr. joo-lee-ites) are defeated).\n\n**Standout Features:**\n\nThe main standout is that it's a game that lets you be the baddie, but also lets you make use, to some degree, of the enemies you defeat.\n\n**Possible Platforms:**\n\nSomething with a mouse/tap interface. I imagine playing this with a controller would be a pain.\n\n**Extra Features:**\n\nExpansions are always an option, as there's millions of horror tropes: haunted camps, ghost ships, and the like.\n\n**How To Credit Me:**\n\n""aethercowboy"" works. If you want a real name, DM me."

7134mf,C++ developer looking for a certain type of idea.,I have currently have a team of 6 but we can't agree on what we are going to be our next project so we decided if we like a idea on here we are going to make it and also keep in mind we are willing to do this project for a while so don't limit yourself in ideas. We are thinking making either a grand strategy taking place in the Victorian age or similar to what someone posted on an idea here a month ago which was a open world game where the players shape the world. we had some ideas for this such as being able to capture castles/villages and controlling a npc army that you command. Also having npc workers that can build you a town/castle etc.. So if you have an idea please tell us and go into detail about the features and details it would have thanks.
712ec0,A skateboarding game where the ground moves in waves,"It's basically along the lines of *Tony Hawk's Pro Skater* or *Skate*, except the world you're in is constantly rolling and rippling in waves. You basically have the usual ramps and half-pipes to jump from, and rails to grind on, but now the ground is constantly on the move, and nothing sits still.\n\nThe size of the waves could vary during gameplay. There could be swells, where the waves are larger and launch you higher into the air, either as a power up, a timed event, or a mutator. You can trick off of these waves, or you can do manuals to ""surf"" them. Or the waves could be shallow for a small period of time, which means you can't really jump off of them or get pushed around.\n\nFor an even wobblier experience, there could also be secondary waves that cause entire sections of one map to be massively pushed up with another section massively pushed down, and vice versa.\n\nWhat do you think?"
70ykt7,A Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Video Game,"Basics:\n\nThis is a 3D scrolling brawler, with a combat system inspired very much by the Batman Arkham game series, with its intense reliance on counters, combos and rhythmic enemy management. While there will still be some puzzles and platforming, it will not be truly open world, but will allow and even require backtracking at certain points for story purposes. To enhance the combat part of the game an incredible soundtrack would be created/assembled in order to really help bring players into the dance of the music. The game could be played solo or switching between a player and an AI, however the highest scores and most effective combos are only possible with four characters, and thus, two or more players.\n\nCombat\n\nWhat makes ""TMNT: Beatdown"" special is that all four of the brothers can fight as a unit. Each possesses, basic moves on their face buttons, an attack, a lighter sweeping attack used to stun, a jump button for evasion and dodging and a counter button for countering attacks or grabbing if there is no grab. Here, instead of lighting up all attacks in blue Arkham-style, attacks would light up in the color corresponding to the turtle being attacked (i.e. a Purple counter warning for Donatello, or Red and Blue for an attack meant for Leo and Raph). Because the turtles are meant to fight as a unit, any of the turtles can counter an attack, and because of the rhythm of the game which subtly attacks in waves, the system automatically distributes counters amongst the attackers, though it defers to whatever direction the player is pushing the stick while countering. The effect of this is that the players understand that these characters have each other's back, a nasty combo can continue onwards as a brother steps in to hold off the incoming attacks. \n\nWhat would make the action even more frenetic, as the heroes deal with Dynasty Warriors-sized waves of foes, albeit with the choreographed attacking you'd see in an Arkham game, is that in addition to stunning a foe so a teammate can unleash a combo to down them, heroes can also grab, which can be used in tandem with the stun move and a direction to send enemies towards other players. These types of team maneuvers dramatically raise the combo counter, allowing the use of advanced moves such as area takedowns, special maneuvers like a two-turtle man-sized bowling ball, and similar.\n\nIn addition to this, each turtle would have their own strengths:\n\nLeonardo would be the most balanced, with the moderate reach of his two bladed weapons, he would be the one who inflicts damage over time on foes. His special ability 'leadership' would allow him to 'paint' targets, which would unlock special four-man combos where the turtles could dogpile that foe in a single incredible beatdown\n\nRaphael would be the strongest and toughest (and largest) turtle. His two parrying weapons would make him not only able to counter more types of weapons, but he would be able to disarm bladed without costing him any of his combo counter. His special ability would be a berserker mode in which he becomes as fast as his fastest brother.\n\nMichaelangeo would be the quickest and most agile turtle. His two swining nunchaku would allow him to counter nearly any weapon, even thrown weapons and counter and grab in a single move as opposed to doing one or the other based on context as his brothers do. His special ability would be styling with his nunchaku, which would double as a taunt as well as allow him to continue his combo counter for a bit even when an enemy is not in reach.\n\nDonatello would be the smart one, able to trigger electronic devices that appear occasionally through most maps. His immense staff would give him superior and surprising range, making his main attack double as a sweeping attack and his stun attack strike more people, also allowing him to counter enemies out of reach of the others and enable some complex three-person super moves with the help of his staff and the power of leverage and physics. \n\nEnemies\n\nJust as in the Arkham games, however, enemies come in different shapes and sizes, with different weapons. In Beatdown, there are normal punchy enemies, as well as those with blades, one handed blunt melee weapons, one handed melee weapons that are blades, two handed melee weapons (ie staves), one handed firearms and two handed firearms. While melee weapons simply increase range and damage, blades create cuts which have DoT effects, making them priority in many cases. Likewise, firearms because they are at range cannot easily be countered, and so someone needs to keep an eye out for those guys and take them down. There are variations, to body types as well, including comically large muscle men, comically large obese men, those with body armor and those with specialty or powered weapons like stun batons, chainsaws, whips, claws, poison spit and more. \n\nIn all cases, when an attack is 'unblockable' it shows up as a black counter symbol outlined in white.  Additionally there are special character types, such as robot mousers and mutant bosses that carry additional special properties and after defeated as bosses or mini bosses, can be mixed in with other sets of thugs for increased diversity of combat situations, all lending to a very dense Streets of Rage feel where players have to prioritize different foes and not miss counters. The overall storyline for the enemies would be what you expect: The Foot, some mutant animal people headlined by Bebop and Rocksteady and, I dunno... Shellhead?\n\nWorld\n\nThe game world would be a stylize tour of New York, starting with a fight in the sewers for people to get their feet wet in, then going to the streets of New York at night to deal with a flood of fighters, then heading into a large office building before heading out to the docks to check out the night life as a huge block party and fair, before going through a large industrial complex and its datacenters before ending up upstate in the woods, and then there's a train and a military base and then of course the technodrome before things go all the way back to the sewers.\n\nThere would be two unlockable characters: Casey Jones and Karai. Casey Jones would feature weapon changing so that he could adapt the styles of any of the Turtles, as well as rollerblades to make him the fastest mover. Karai would have some incredible stealth abilities and function essentially as a Rogue class would. She would be armed with kunai which function in short range like Raph's Sai, but can also be thrown to counter ranged foes. April O'Niel would be unlockable as a companion character, a character who can operate devices like Donatello and face off one on one with a mininon, but can't make it alone in these places. If you take her with you, you get extra cutscenes (From her camera) and it is the only way to get S-Rank in missions. She is, essentially, the hard mode of the game. Maybe release Splinter, who is counter-dependent but also a monster just after countering.\n\n"
70yii7,"Wanting to make a cute pet simulator game, like the Chaos on Sonic Adventures. I've got the animals randomized just need some ideas for the game :( help?",
70wvd4,A Hero's Journey,"I was wondering about an idea that isn't particularly original but I think would be fun to play, and fits a niche (4player couch co-op) that I think has plenty of room to expand now that the Steam Link has made couch co-ops popular again. Thought it up last night.\n\nHeavily inspired by that video that was on the front page a day or so ago\n\n----\n\n#Overview\n\nThis game is narrated similar to Stanley’s Parable an attempts to apply a particular tale of the Hero’s Journey. It is meant to be played as a 4-player couch co op role playing beat-em-up game using controllers.\n\n# Goals\n\n- 5-7 hour playtime\n- Large amount of dialogue\n- Large number of branching decisions\n\n# Introduction\n\nThe story begins in a large house, which is dirty in several places. The left edge and right edge appear to be pathable. The camera is fixed with the two houses at the center. Besides the four players, which are affectionately named Aristocles (m), Sieger (m), Brodie (m), and Elaine (f), there are 3 NPCs they can interact with. 2 of those npcs are in a neighboring house (Emmy and Jane), while one of them is in their house (Alfred the step-dad). When the players interact with Alfred they are told to “clean the house”. The players can remove the various dirty items in the room, which when they do an arrow will show them where to put it. Once the house is clean, Alfred will tell them to go to bed. Upon doing so, the house will reset and Alfred's interactions will repeat.  \n\nThis section will teach the players about the movement in the game and help them get a feel for the jump-height and jump-length. The space between houses is exactly the max jump, so particularly explorative players would be able to jump from one roof to the other.  \n\nIf the players attempt to reach the edges of the screen then Alfred would popup a message saying “Don’t wander so far! It could be dangerous.” The player is blocked from further movement towards that edge.\nIf the players decide to interact with Emmy and Jane they will get various flirtatious choices, but they will all get shot down. For example, the following would be a potential conversation between Aristocles and Emmy:\n\n	A: So, how’s life going over here?\n	E: Okay.\n	A: Up for a game of Juguetes?\n	E: No, Aristocles. That game doesn’t even support two-player. Go home!\n\nThis stage does not end until the 4 players clean the house 5 times, at which point as they wake up a man named Esmond riding a horse from the left edge of the screen rides through. As Esmond crosses the screen he drops a map between the two houses, which he does not appear to notice. When he is in Emmy and Jane’s house he pauses next to them for a few seconds before they both jump on his horse and ride into the sunset (right edge of screen). The players may then interact with the map, which shows the two houses in the top-center of the screen. Near the bottom middle there is a large X, with no further explanation. There are some large landmarks also noted, including a “DANGER” hand-written in the middle, and a circle on the top-right of the screen. The players can make out a grid on the map. The grid is 9 wide and 13 tall. The players are at 3-0 (top-middle left 1), though they do not themselves appear on the map.  \n\nAfter a few seconds two dialogue options appear at the bottom of the screen, one “Close map” and one “Go on an adventure”. At this time the narrator appears for the first time, saying:  \n\n&gt; And so our four characters were met with their first decision. Should they try to find what lies on the X, leaving the comfort and familiarity of their home behind? Will they take nothing but their sense of adventure into the wilderness? Only time will tell…\n\nIf the players choose to Close the map the narrator would say:  \n\n&gt; Alas these were just teenagers, to leave everything they know behind would be a great cost. They did not live a life of comforts, but it was a life they knew well. They could store the map elsewhere, whatever was at the X probably wasn’t going anywhere. Though it might be a bit boring now that Emmy and Jane aren’t around.\n\nThe map could be placed in the bedroom of one of the players or in their inventory. Eventually the players would choose to Go on an adventure:\n\n&gt; They knew not of the dangers that would lie ahead. All they had was the clothes on their back and determination in their hearts. So they glanced at the map once more to get their heading and notice the clearly placed objective, then set forth on the only direction that they can go that would get them closer to a marking on the map..\n\nAt this point the characters return to the map with only one dialog option remaining - to close the map. If they do so there is no narration, but when they return to the game the camera is no longer fixed - it’s centered at the average location of the 4 players. They may choose whether to go left or right, however the narration hopefully convinced the players to go to the left (the wrong direction) which would encourage the “Refusal of the Call” that every true hero’s journey needs. \n\nThis concludes the introduction to the game.\n\n## To the left\nOnce the players have gone for about 30 seconds to the left they see a bridge that was cut on the right side making it useless for crossing water. Besides the jagged rock their are javelins sharp-end-up barely piercing the top of the water. The game makes a brief 100-500ms pause with the “Auto-saving” text on the top-right, where it does any necessary loading or unloading. \n\n&gt; The players opted to head to the west. Though the map did not indicate anything on this side, they knew that Esmond had come from this direction. They’ve happened upon a small bridge that appears to have been cut on the right. The water below looks treacherous, and not only due to its high pressure and jagged rocks...\n\nThis would be the first time the players noted they could not move around while narration was occurring. The bridge is 1 block too far to jump. If a character falls in the water they die and the narrator says some variation of:\n\n&gt; Sieger wasn’t about to let any little bridge get in his way. So he crouched down a little to the east of the bridge and prepared a running start. Of course this bridge would make a terrible plot-device if you could just jump over it, so he fell to into the rapid moving water and was lethally pierced by the many pointy sticks. The other adventurers were so horrified by this event that they swore never to leave the safety of their house again, bringing this story and my purpose to an untimely conclusion. Thanks for nothing, Sieger!\n\nThere is only one chat option for each of the four characters if they jump to their death, which is repeated. After this a loading screen would start and they characters would spawn at their last Auto-Save (when they first saw the bridge).. The narration would play again “The players opted to head to the west..”, but a skip option would be available this time. (press A to skip!)\n\nThe only option for the players would be to return to their home, with the narrator saying:\n\n&gt; The adventurers awkwardly returned home and tried to avoid eye-contact with Alfred as they got back on-track with the story.\n\n## To the right\n\n&gt; These four explorers began their journey to the East, heading toward the circle on the map since they don’t know how to go down so this is the next best thing.  This was the first indication that these adventurers had the intuition that would be so critical on a dangerous mission such as this.\n\nThe game-play goal of this section is to select who will use the melee combat system. Players will get a chance to change this exactly once when all four classes have been displayed. You might note that there are exactly 5 grid locations on the map to the right of the players start - the first 4 will be for selecting one class and the last will be for any shuffling that the players want to do after seeing each of the four characters\n\nStory-wise these sections will act sort of as “meeting a mentor” in a more gameplay-appropriate way.\nIn the middle of this section there is a person sleeping on a tree, and to the left of the tree is that person’s sword and shield. The sword and shield are interactable with the **Equip** message. Upon trying to use this, the narrator warns the players (based on who tried):\n\n&gt; Sneakily, Elaine went to “borrow” the armor and weapons of the sleeping man. She is, of course, doing this understanding that she will be the one to wield the heavy armor and close-range weaponry of the group and this won’t be reversible for some time…\n\nThe next time any of the characters interact with the armor it is equipped onto their character and they get a sword and shield with plate armor.\n\n&gt; And so it was Brodie that decided to wear the armor of the sleeping man. But as he gets into the very last piece - which fits surprisingly well - he accidentally makes a noise that awakens the man. Aristocles, Sieger, and Elaine are forced to watch helplessly as Brodie fights less-than-perfectly against the man who unsheathes a knife he had in his back pocket.\n\nThe melee class has 3 fighting options - a large above-head attack, a short piercing attack, and blocking with his shield.  He does, very obviously, 1 point of damage with the pierce and 2 damage with the overhead attack during this fight against the 100-health man. After dealing 20 damage, the narrator says\n\n&gt; It has become very apparent that this sword is very dull and Brodie isn’t particularly strong yet. Luckily the man decides to run away out of boredom and the story can go on.\n\nThe man runs out through the right edge of the screen, and the characters are allowed to continue.\n\n----\n\nThat's as far as I have gotten. I'm wondering what peoples thoughts are on the idea!\n\nWould you pay $15 for the game described above (assuming it was fleshed to 5-7 hours of play of course)?\n"
70vzmi,two realities platformer,"Update:\n\nThe basic idea is a normal side-scroller, where you can jump, run towards the right of the screen, pick up items, etc.\n\nThe additional ""twist"" is that there are two realities (like two different levels on the same screen... different backgrounds, one might be more ""dark"" than the other one). You can move the slider right or left past your character so that he moves from one reality to the other.\n\n\nBy moving the slider you can escape from an enemy that is about to catch you (only you can pass from one reality to another) or maybe in one reality you can pick up an item that you need to complete a quest on the other reality, whatever.."
70tx11,A Democratic Roguelike (Tiles),
70tswh,A Democratic Roguelike (Tiles),"Yes, I realize that this idea would, at first, create something truly ugly and messy, but I believe that it would be self-organizing and almost self-polishing once the game gets going. And of course, it simply *must* be implemented as a web app! LOL\n\n...\n\n* **The Meat of Democracy:** Most developers listen to user input, at least a little bit, but I think it would be interesting to see how a more direct method would perform! Users could affect the game from within the game! Think something similar to the creature tables in the minecraft wiki (and most other game wiki's for that matter), with the name, health, and other stats in discreet and well organized cells.\n\n* **Creative Voting!** Don't like a character's name? Bring up the context menu by clicking on it, and you will see an option to write in a name, and a list of 'suggestions' that were written in by previous players. Think a character portrait or tile is ugly, think you could do better? Bring up the context menu by clicking it, and you can draw your own, or select from an image gallery of previous user submissions! This could be generalized to work for a lot of different things, from species, to unique monsters, to items and weapons and outfits, and even bosses. Your changes would  be applied only to your session (mostly) immediately and be saved as personal preferences for future play sessions. What you choose becomes an instant vote, and influences what future games will look like!\n\n* **Difficulty:** A lot of people complain about monsters in games being too easy or too hard. What if you could bring up that creature's stats (by 'inspecting' the creature) and +X or -X on the stat of your choice? It could all be there in the character sheet, loot quality and rarity, which skills a creature has, even the local stat modifiers for the dungeon level you're on...\n\n* **Limits:** You only get one vote for each thing. You can change your vote as often as you like, but it's one vote. The X factor is a secret algorithm that regulates the 'base stats' so that the game may be played at various difficulty settings. You can choose to make a veritable christmas tree of the character stats by marking each one with red- or green+ coins, or you can leave them all as they are.\n\n* **First Release Idea:** You (the developer) could even create the game totally empty, if you wanted, and have players choose to increase the number of dungeon levels, dungeon types, monsters and items in the game with a simple +/- X voter coin. As the dev, you would be tasked with generating much of the initial creative content, and designing the user interface to be as seamless and idiot-proof as possible.\n\n* **User Credit:** Graphics and sounds and stuff would, of course, have credits displayed directly in the vote menu for each piece of content. It could be useful to have a donation option next to the user's name (a gold coin?) so that players could directly show their appreciation to the developer. As a good safety measure, people should have to load credits into the game separately from donating, and of course, an easy-to-find list of donations, in case a child gets donation-happy or something.\n\n* **That's it.** - completely free idea, please put me in credits if you use one of my ideas, thanks."

70rsg2,My game idea,"The game starts with the earth about to be destroyed by a cataclysm of some kind. You are sent back in time to advance technology to the point that the earth will no longer be in danger at the start of the game.

There could even be different ending where you save the world from one thing, but trigger another somehow"
70o3jr,A Sci-Fi game with similar gameplay to Dishonored.,"Similar to the cancelled Star Wars Bounty Hunter game in concept, but much more akin to Dishonored in terms of feel. With a few additions to variation for sake of role playing, it would probably be a hit. Also, the addition of multiplayer, customization, and variation would lead to a interesting new IP based in a genre which has tremendous potential.\n\nP.S.- If this has been done, please lmk so I can get it and play it!!!"

70eeii,Pilgrim's Progress,"If you know the allegory I'm talking about then you're probably like ""yeeeeeah, how bout no."" But hear me out.\n\nIf done right you could have an incredibly visually arresting game that tells a dark and compelling story. It is heavily influenced by Christian themes, but I feel like downplaying the religious aspect will leave you with a story that many people, religious or otherwise will relate to. \n\nMake it more about his personal strength and perseverance through his tribulations and not so much the woo woo faith stuff. The illustrations from the book I remember as a kid have been burned into my brain and if you could translate that style into a video game it would be one of the most unique experiences.\n\nI imagining the gameplay being a combination of exploration and puzzle solving with some large scale combat here and there, like shadow of colossus or God of War, less flashy though. The game would be a semi-open world, instead of there being this huge wide space to explore, you'll always have multiple paths to choose from and the difficulty of the game depends on which of these paths you take.\n\nJust want to be clear, it's not supposed to be a religious game, I just feel like the story would lend itself well to interesting gameplay, and it's a classic for a reason, it's just so gripping, especially with that Bosch-esque art style that's stuck with me so vividly."

706zo2,escape room challenge (ultimate classroom edition),"The idea involves a group of about 16 students who are seniors in high school. They're in an after school club aspiring to an escape room, regional competition, to be held and their high school. It starts out as the students are bouncing ideas back and forth- like laser beams and various traps. I'll admit some of my ideas are fuzzy here- but an escape room, with some clever clues and scenarios. \n\nIt's late school year, the senior high school students are looking forward to graduation, spirits are high, and the weather is wonderful. Sunny and not a cloud in the sky, light breeze. Teacher (who is either an attractive late 20's female, or a more middle aged male quirky physics teacher) cracks open the window a bit. Spirits are high, ideas are bouncing back and forth. (in my original dream that inspires this idea, Lea Michele via ""Glee"" makes a guest appearances suggestion a song/dance challenge, and brings up the question of ""Why most this challenge imply such competition-violence, why don't we instead all sing and dance and get along?"" The rest of the students reply in unison, ""This isn't Glee!"" ) \n\nIt's time for the day of the competition:\n\nNow, remember, the window is cracked open. Everything is going well, that is until a freak storm happens. The winds begin to howl, and torrential rainfall comes pouring out of nasty storm clouds, and suddenly- the schools sewage system overflows from all the water. The water gets inside the building. It becomes the ultimate escape room, as water levels rise. A siren indicating a tornado rings out. You can pick from the stereotypical football/jock player, a well built star quarterback, but can he squirm and swim his way through narrow hallways, or even through the crack in the window? The petite yet toned and flexible (and adorably ditzy) cheerleader, the nerd who's highly creative and gifted (but has poor vision), the shy bookworm, and etc. A handful of students with a unique set of advantages and disadvantages? Can you make your way out, or will you drown? "
706u45,morbid dream inspo,"I had this morbidly trippy awesome dream while taking a nap this afternoon. (Maybe I've been watching too much Life Is Strange gameplay) Here it goes:\nLIke LIS, it's a choose your own adventure type of game. The graphics are mostly similar, only a bit more gruesome and less of a subdued color theme. Metal and Psychedelic music plays in the background. A group of individuals of all ages and backgrounds are sitting inside an old, worn down school bus. Most notably creepy in my dream, is that I can choose to play myself. As I begin the journey of my character, it's just another day in front of my pc, reading through facebook, reddit, watching Youtube, Twitch, etc. Only there's something off. I try to text my buddy about this cool gameplay I saw, only to find out I literally can't text, and the sites I have saved have been up since the previous evening. I'm not alive... I'm a ghost. The game continues- presenting different clues, that lead to myself discovering that I had a died a morbid, horrendous death in a freak Final Destination type of death while outside partying the night before, and (details are a little blurry) some vodka in my red solo cup accidentally mix with a liter of gasoline... and I die. I'm a bit shy and I've wandered off the main party scene to get some privacy, I'm guessing near a garage, so there's no solid witnesses... plus everyone else is drunk as well. So I have to piece all the info together to solve my own death.\nThe other characters are in a similar scenario, including a young goth/gamer girl who was brutally killed by her boyfriend in a ghastly cover-up where all the details of the crime are manipulated.\n\nSomething sort of unique I didn't include was this tripyy space/time dizzying time warp device and while going through it you had to click on various things... like which universe to enter (showed as blinking gray spirals) as well as clues and devices, even weapons to collect if you can click them fast enough.\nWhen it comes to the game play, my idea was rather straight forward, but I'd like to make it more morbid.\n\nJust wanted to share, there's so more trippy details, but hence it was a dream, it didn't all exactly make sense, but that's basically the gist of it. Any thoughts/ideas/suggestions? "

After I heard the story I asked if anyone else thought this could make a good game, and a lot of people agreed.

6tii6e,Need help in inventing puzzles and name for my game,"I know this is place for game ideas but i couldn't find better place for it for now. So i'm making a point and click puzzle game based slightly around idea from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/6mis7q/survival_game_centered_around_the_sun/) . So this will be a 2d game were you will be some guy that took place in a experiment where he would be frozen for 100 years and he was frozen somewhere around 1950s. Then at the time when there was a competition on making biggest nuke (tsar bomb was build in 1961 [size of the bomb explosion](http://www.atomicheritage.org/sites/default/files/Nuclear%20Comparison.jpg) ) USA built a bomb based around making a white hole (theoretical ""object"" that's the opposite of black hole) and that bomb whiped out whole life on earth around 1962. Guy you are playing as is the only one unfreezed in 2050, other were woken up in 1962 when the bomb exploded, you are in a bunker inside a mountain (something like shelters in fallout) and you are trying figure out what happened when you were frozen. In you bunker you have some supplies in case of the worst scenario that accually happened, you need to power up the generators and fix other stuff, you also have some suits to go out if air were polluted etc. you have some guns, tools, and you are next to a village that is in moderate condition. you are in the bunker like 20% of the game trying to fix stuff, find clues and try to go out the rest is you looking for clues and other people in the village, mostly you find only some news papers and one recording of what really happened in the end. You also find an old cadillac that will be in this game for sure :D\n\nSo if you have some ideas what to change, ideas for puzzles and for name for that game i will be very thankfull and you will be added in people that supported me in the game and also i will add some easter eggs that you'll choose.\n\nSorry for my terrible English, it's not my native language :("

Please help me fellow redditors 😅"
6t8q1l,Two new social game modes I would like to see,"Hi!\nSo I've been sitting on these concepts for a while, and I want to publish them somewhere because I like them.\n\n\n\n\nHawk Mode\n\nA game-mode where a second player can join a main players game in a subsidiary role. The second players impact is limited but purposeful and the control scheme should have a simplified setting. The main and second players should have a way to talk to each other.\n\nExample I: The Witcher III\n\nA second player can join as a hawk, fly around or sit on the protagonists arm or a treebranch. The hawk can catch small animals which can be used by the main player and attack/distract singular enemies. \n\nWho is this for:\nA parent, younger brother or friend who is interested in the game/wants to experience it alongside the player. This could also be used as a reward by streamers.\n\nWhy is this a good idea:\nIt would enable a gamer to share his/her world with someone not as familiar and offer some social interaction trough what is normally a solitary experience.\n\n\n\nEmperor-/Citizen-Mode\n\nOwners of a game can join the ""empires"" of streamers/youtubers as ""citizens"", hence the name. When a stream is live the citizens can join the streamer in a limited but purposeful role (Being a single merchant in an kingdom or a battalion in a military unit). The citizens should use the game mechanics to compete against each other, all the while helping or hindering the streamer slightly. The streamer can punish, reward, promote or ban his citizens in game.\n\nExample: Hearts of Iron IV\nThe citizen takes on the role of a battalion in a division. (or a ship or a plane) The citizens are allocated to a division/fleet/wing according to a rooster. There can be multiple citizens in a division/... . When the emperor gives a command all citizens concerned can react to the order accordingly to boost the stats of the unit. When in battle the citizens have a small manual role to play that can influence the combat strength marginally.\nThe streamer could even give command over divisions and armies to a citizen by promoting them to division leader and then to commander and so on. \n\nWho is this for: \nStreamers that play tycoon/4X/management/Empire building games and their fans\n\nWhy is this a good idea:\nIncreasing the interaction between the streamer and his/her community in a purposeful way is a desire shared both by content producer and fan.\n\n\n\nFeel free to hit me up to elaborate and thanks for any feedback"
6t8kcg,"2D Game Concept, anyone want to make this?","Preface: I am a writer (of poetry and books, not code) and so I will never make this game.  But oh boy, do I want to play it.  Open to critques/suggestions.  Also, this is a bit long, bear with me.\n\nConcept:\nA top-down 2D RPG type of game. (so original, I know...but wait).\n \n  As far as asthetics, pixel-art-ish.  As for overall feel of the game, think of something like a blend between Zelda and Stardew Valley-lots of exploration, but also sandboxy in that there is a base-building aspect to it.  \n\n**Part 1: Story/World Overview**\n\n  There is a world ruled by kings and magicians.  Humans rule cities with iron fists and the coldness of ice, but outside the cities, powers ancient and mystical abound.\n\n  There is a terribly old legend about a place far, far to the north.  The legend says that a group of wizards once fled the populated, warring low-lands and founded their own kingdom, the Kingdom of the Sapphire Sky, that existed on a flotilla of islands that hang in the bright blue skies of the north.  Here, an upsurge in magical energies created a flotilla of floating islands where the wizards could gather and study the secrets of magic unhindered by the wars and troubles of the world.  That was a thousand years ago, and no one believes this place ever existed.  \n\n  Except for our hero.  He/She has come to the north to look for this place.  He/She has traveled for many months, enduring great hardships, and found an abandoned watchtower in which to make a headquarters while searching for signs of this lost kingdom.\n\n  So the game would be the experience of searching for (and finding) this lost kingdom, fighting enemies that roam various locations, and building a progressively larger and cooler base.\n\n**Part 2: Mechanics/Magic Overview**\n\n  Magic in this world is about capturing magical energy from the world around and using it.  Magic = life energy.  Captured life essences are stored in special crystals/gems which can then be expended and used in a variety of ways.  Some gems contain the power of glaciers, others the magic of stars and the moon.  Some gems harbor the energy of fire, or tides, or the deep energy of earth.  You can fill gems with the power of darkness or the force of lightning.\n\n  Filling gems with these life-essences would be a significant portion of the game, one that would involve both exploration and skill.\n\nOnce you have gems, you can do several things with them.\n\n1) Crafting: Mostly this would be weapons, armor, and tools.  Craft items would have slots. Slotting gems of certain combinations creates stronger effects.  Effects could include healing, protection, evasion, stronger attacks, etc.\n\n2) Thaumaturgy.  This is spell-casting, unleashing the power of gems with spells.  When used this way, the caster must remember arrangements and sequences of gems to build thaumas.  A thauma is a spell, but I like a word that denotes something specific in this instance. So for an example, one thauma would fire gem + fire gem + lightning gem.  The caster would have to have these three gems in his/her inventory.  This could create a damage over time effect (Fire) plus a chance to stun or blind (lightning).  A thauma cannot be unleashed until a ""correct"" sequence has been filled.  \n\n  To cast a thauma, a player must enter the Reverie.  This is simply a combat interface wherein a bar pops up and the player casts his/her thaumas from memory.  This means that spell power and longevity in fights is partly determined by the types and numbers of gems in players inventory.  \n     \n  (There would be a progression in game as to what gems are available and how long thaumas could be.  For instance, player would start with three-gem thaumas, and by late game, be able to cast 7-gem thaumas that are much more powerful.)\n\n  So combat would take two forms: either swords/weapons etc imbued with gems, or by casting thaumas.  But the player could not do both at the same time, though it would be possible to switch back and forth.\n\n  The list of possible thaumas could be quite large, with a varied list of effects, including healing, elemental damages, evasion, blind effect, Push/Pull effects, etc.  This would allow the player to specialize in certain play styles depending on their preferences.\n\n3) The final way to use gems would be building.  Specifically, you can imbue stone to become Living Stone.  Living Stone takes on the properties of the life-essence used to imbue it.  Many of these effects gem could have on stone would be purely cosmetic.  Others could be very functional.  Many things could be crafted from this Living Stone.\n\n  I have this idea that there would be recruitable NPCs the player could invite to live with them at the base--sort of like Terraria where you can build certain types of rooms and an NPC moves in.  \nThis would give a great amount of goals and structure to base building; within this frame-work, there would be a lot of room for creativity.\n\n  That's more or less the whole game idea.  I think a huge pull of this game experience would be beautiful pixel-art locations, where gathering the life-essences into gems could be almost a meditative/calming experience (for instance, moon gems or waterfall gems) or more of a minigame experience (fire gems or darkness gems).  Also, it would need a sweet soundtrack.\n\n  Thanks for reading to the end.  Even if this is never made, it was fun to dream of it. \n\n\n\n"

Every world seed that has been generated by someone would have a winner with the current max depth reached recorded.\n\nThe player would have a pickaxe, a torch helmet, some tnt, a pontoon, a tent, ropes and other climbing equipment.\n\nThe survival aspect is also important. It would include heat, moisture, hunger and energy management.\n"

6uxh1h,help me lol criticism expected,i have a Game idea involving Zombie apocalypse but you get to play through the outbreak. so you hear on the news as people get murdered and depending on what you decided to do at the beginning of the game helps your stats you can do whatever you like it a game based on the actual survival of an outbreak what would you actually do if you didnt know the outbreak was happening if you dont have skill in strength lets say a shotgun would not be your friend it would hurt due to recoil.also will be 1st person/3rd person toggle. i am not very good at explainations just ask questions and i will answer at the best of my ability 
6uvxkf,"Survival game by, for and with children","These are my 8 year old son's ideas for Ipad-games, he loves playing survival games, and has watched a fair bit of Bear Ghrylls.\n\n He would like to see a game whith a child that has been left by his parents in a hostile environment. Both in nature, and in a dangerous part of town. The game should be a 7 certificate, so no violence, but plenty of danger and tricky situations and obstacles to get through. He wants the graphic to be of high quality, of course. \n\nHe also has another idea, that he calls Garbage life. In this game you are trapped in a garbage plant and you have to survive using things you find in the garbage that you re-use and re-design into tools and other stuff you need to survive. "
6utfc8,Guaranteed massive success if executed well: Mobified Left4Dead competitive deungon crawler.,"First of all make sure you're familiar with mobas and what makes them fun, appealing, and rewarding. Then make sure you understand the competitive mechanics of the Left 4 Dead series. Then proceed:\n\nMy game idea is a game where two teams compete against eachother in say classic moba 5v5. In the first round, team B can first select the dungeon map to be played, then team A builds their hero roster out of a large pool of heroes. Then the round starts, and team B get a 30 second heads up in order to prepare their defenses. Team A has to grind through the dungeon, ideally reach the finish, and secure as many objectives as possible, dying as little as possible, etc. Now similar to left 4 dead, the dungeon is full of NPC creeps, some strong, many not that strong. And then there's the player controlled creeps which team B uses coordinating to delay and obstruct theam A's dungeon grind. They respawn quickly and can take control of powerful creeps or spawn with new special creeps. Similar to the heroes of team A, their creeps have special synergies, skills and abilities. The dungeon also has key rooms and chambers, with interesting traps or mechanics that team B can take advantage of. Team A would have the choice of going the longer, but more score rewarding route, or the shorter route (there would always be choices when navigating the dungeon between high risk/high reward or lower risk/lower rward. There's also 'levels' to the dungeon, giving the heroes party opportunity to purchase items after every level. A dungeon raid should last maybe 10 minutes. Then the roles are reversed. Whichever team has the highest score in their dungeon raid, wins.\nI'm completely certain that this game is a recipie for massive success. But it would require a very competitive conscious game design angle. Camera view and visuals would all be like dota. \n\nWould love to hear some thoughts.\n"

6urdvx,Online open world,"I've been thinking of an idea of an online open world game where the players have to build the game and the game gives them the tools... The game will have all the different ecosystems on our planet, and the resources are limited, if they cut trees without replanting they will run out, the building they build can serve a purpose, they can start joining and building together villages, cities and eventually multiple countries.\nI can go in more details if people think this would be an interesting game."
6uo6tc,Title: Knight. This is gonna be a long one.,"A story and quest based game in the first person view. The game takes place in medevil france, where there's vast rural areas and many city states. You fight enemies in a hyper realistic way and learn from every fight. You can get fatiged, your muscles could cramp up, and you suffer from hunger and thirst just as much as your real world counter part. Enemies have different fighting styles that depend on their rank, place of training and physical strength. \n\n\nYou aren't some maniac swinging a sword wildly to kill hordes of enimies. Every swing can either land a killing blow if it peirces the armor, or it could be easily countered and lead to your quick demise. You only fight as hard as you train and your armor only lasts depending on its craftsmanship.\nSwords and Armor break like real swords and Armor, same with bows. Hilts can break and shoulder pads can weaken, leading to a quick disarming. Every thing that can hurt you WILL hurt you.\n\nThe story : You are the son a Lord who lives with his family, servants, and fellow countrymen. The castle you inhabit has stood for centuries with countless invasions. This is all possible due to your father leading the hold and all its defenders but he comes down with a deadly illness. Spies determined that now would be the time to strike. Waves of grey clad men storm your home and they mercilessly slaughter every one guarding it. Your father sends you into the keep as he battles off four men at a time. You return to your mother who saddles you up on a horse to escape the seige. The horse takes you far south as you watch everything you have ever know go up in embers. You are young, lost and drifting. Ran out of space, woops \n\nYou find your uncle, high Knight and leader of a guild that takes you in at the age of 12. 7 years pass and you a full fledged guild member. You choose your fighting style, class, subclass. Let's make an example. Style: Euf School ( Quick blows and the ability to shred through armor weak points) Class: Lance ( Balanced in both movement speed and armor with extra experience with long weapons) Subclass: Ranger ( May also use a ranged weapons and has better knowledge of edible plants.)\n\nYou complete small tasks like the escorting until you climb the ladder into things like fighting bandits and tracking down dangerous criminals. Your influence and experience grow with each quest. Your weapons and armor feel lighter, and you are more in tune with combat. \nWith this you track down the clan that killed your family and recruit the friends you've made along the way alongside fellow guild members."
6untq0,Online Open World Gang/Crime Shooter (Concept),"Setting: North America (Canada, U.S.A, and Mexico) circa 2005. \nStory Basis (Plot): No Story since its online. Only thing close to a story is the intro, where your character meets up with your new mentor (who will help you throughout the game) and he says, ""Ever wonder what it'd feel like in Hell? Welcome to North America!"" and hands you a gun and some money (1,000$) to get you on your feet. \nGameplay: You need to choose a side, be a hero or be a villian, being a villian comes with another set of choices however. You need to choose a gang, mafia or prison to start in. A hero just means a cop or just overall good guy on the street. \n\nThat's all i can really squeeze out my brain for this idea right now, been thinking about it all day... feel free to give any opinions in the comments..

6unb7m,A sort of city builder/management game where you run a dystopia,This is an idea I've recently come up with and wanted to share. Basically my idea is you would be like the leader of a dystopia similar to things like Oceania from 1984 or maybe Pamen from Hunger Games.\n\n\nYou need to build and manage your dystopia by training your peacekeepers and thought police and expanding your surveillance network.\n\n\nYou could also do things like rewrite history to suit your agenda or create false wars in order to rally the population.\n\n\nJust an idea I had and wanted to share.\n

6umpmd,Turn based light rpg where dice play the main role,"There is something about dice I really like. The feel, the luck element, the design. For years I have visioned in my head of a light turn based rpg pc game with graphical elements similar to a tabletop game.\n\nThe idea ia quite simple, yet allow player to modify, boost, etc the characters stats and abilities with cards and dice. The throw is in 3D with enough physics to give the same feel as in real world, at least close (not same freedom).\n\nThere are different kind of dice, basic, fire, ice, etc. That modify the effect of the attack. Or a die can have some special effects if you manage to throw that result. Player can discover special ""ancient"" dice that are fragile but powerful. Perhaps even one time use only.\n\nPlayer can choose a setup of dice before heading out for a venture. Limiting the amount of dice carried at one time. Perhaps one for movement and one for attack + maybe one for bonus, not sure yet.\n\nThere will also be cards to add functionality to the game.\n\nMaps will be grid design ""dungeons"".\n\nPlayer will be able to discover puzzle items, treasures, dice, cards, etc.\n\nStory: I am thinking this with retro in mind and this could be just a kid fighting against monsters."
6um9do,A Game idea that makes me want to study game design.,"i have this huge idea for a huge game, this idea has really set my mind into game design, now this game is based off several themes which are: Game of thrones, Mount and blade, and medevil warfare.\nThis game will be a huge map with a huge lobby for people to play, players will have to build up from nothing to gain a castle or a keep an army and allies, each player can set up a house with they're friends or start on their own the next part is heavily influenced by Game of thrones there will be one main city for the king at the start there will be a rush to occupy the throne, the king will have to keep rule the kingdom and will dedicate wardens of the south of the map, the west, the east and the north each place will have a different climate and different resources,\nthis is just scratching the surface of what i have in mind for this, this would be a HUGE project for anyone i plan for this map to be in some places to be hours a way from each parts of the realm.\nwe would need the players to kind of rp but if they want to ride for the capital and take the throne for themselfs they can i just know this is the kind of game i would like to play an actual huge medevil map filled with lots of  people each have there own houses, castles and armys anyway i've type way too much \nlet me known what you think-MK"
6ultow,Games where you're trying to solve some kind of puzzle but monsters chase you and to escape you must progress in the puzzle in such a rushed way that you tangle it which causes you problems soon becoming impractical to continue the puzzle that way and the monsters get you,"Theres many possible kinds of puzzles. In general, I imagine monsters interfering with specific parts of the puzzle, limiting which moves you can make without touching them. Their interference makes solving it hard, and due to your lack of planning ahead (cuz they rush you while blocking some combinations) you make mistakes that cost you in what possible moves in the puzzle remain. You try to backtrack but they rush you some more and you tangle it some more. You try to escape but its so tangled you can barely move the puzzle pieces without getting in eachothers way. And the monsters catch you as you've blocked yourself in too many ways."

Keep that in mind.\n\nWhat if Yugioh had a MOBA?\n\nIt would be something like League of Legends or DOTA, (but if that seems a bit too big, compare it more to Adventure Time Battle Party) but the playable characters are monsters from the card game. The only ones I've thought of so far that could work in this include Dark Magician, Harpey Lady, Flame Swordsman, Summoned Skull, Kuriboh, Man-Eater Bug, Gaia the Fierce Knight, Jinzou, Blue-Eyes and Red-Eyes, the Magnet Warriors, Buster Blader, and Black Luster Soldier. (I don't know much past the first series, but If I knew some I would count them). Everyone's auto attack would be the attack used during the show when they attack, like Dark Magic Attack for Dark Magician, while abilities are spells or traps that are associated with the monster, or are often used with it in decks. Spells and traps could also work as the items that you buy. It's just a random fun idea I had, and I don't even know that much about MOBA's.\n\nAgain, I'm sorry about posting this here, but I really wanted to talk about this."
6ub5l5,2D Game Ides,I want to make my first game In the Unreal Engine but don't have any Idea what.
6ub1t0,"Many players, each a ball, near eachother, trying to stop eachother from escaping, but to do that you must move farther away than them to block their path so it looks like you are trying to escape","Players would have to predict if other players are trying to escape vs prevent others from escaping. Both look very similar. Someone will be farther away than all others, but they might be trying to push back in the player who is second farthest away, and even after pushing him may try to escape.\n\nThere would have to be subtle adjustments to how fast players can go so they'll be able to catch eachother in various combinations.\n\nMost of these players would probably be NPCs."
6u9kke,game about selling and buying stocks,"so everyone wants to be rich, and one way to get rich is to buy stocks and sell them at the right time. \n so what if there was a game about it, it will be simple but deep and interesting. \n so lets talk some about actual game, you get some money for example 1000$, and you have to buy stocks, and there is some information about this week's events, ex, donald trump said that fast food is good, and you think that if he said that, stock price of fast food company like burger king and then you get profit, idk much about stock market, if someone knows about it please wright it down in the comments, to get this idea better. :) "
6u7504,Serial killers! What I want more than any other hypothetical videogame is a serial killer simulator.,"I wish there were games about serial homicide where you play as the killer.  I imagine something with gameplay very similar to the Hitman series, but in first-person to create that perverse intimacy with the environment that you are skulking around in (remember that feeling you had as a kid when you were hiding in the bathroom stall while enemies searched for you in the original *Deus Ex*?), utilizes a completely open world like GTA, and with a greater focus on preventing evidence from accumulating at the crime scene, as well as an emphasis on relishing the stalk and the kill, performing ritualistic sex acts before during and/or after the murder, using preferred weapons and techniques, employing signature killing methods and distinctive mutilation of the bodies, just generally developing your own unique MO, that sort of thing.  Also, the plot would revolve around the internal struggles and personal mission of a refreshingly understated protagonist, an outwardly common man, with no Tom Clancy style nonsense or other grandiose bullshit ruining the vibe.  No ex-super soldier back stories, no warlords, no communists or Nazis, no political intrigue, no drug kingpins, no aliens, and, most importantly, no motherfucking ""chosen ones"".  Just one miserable man confronting the absurd on his terms and holding nothing back, someone like Ted Bundy or Andrei Chikatilo.  You should feel like a Chuck Palahniuk character dropped into Silent Hill 2, but the monsters are just people.\n\nI'm very proud of my collection of photographs of murdered women that I've taken over a long period of time in GTAV while roleplaying as a serial killer.  Usually I just pick up prostitutes, drive them to a remote location, decline their services, and kill them when they get out of the car.  Then I move them into various positions by shooting their bodies with a shotgun (because there's no other way to move the bodies around), open up the camera app, play around with filters, and attempt to take pictures that capture the residual terror and gruesome vacancy of the subject.  Sometimes I'll grab a police cruiser and use it to flag down motorists at night, then shoot them through their window like the Son of Sam killer.  I want a whole game like this.  Somebody make this game right now."
6u6f6e,"Probably best as a one level ""gimmick"", but I can see it working as a full game.","I'm horrible at explaining things, so I'll give the general premise, and if something doesn't make sense, just ask.\n\nYou are in a giant castle. As you enter a certain room, you find that the door you need to go through is at the top of the wall. The only thing you can reach is a painting of the castle you are in. When you check it out, you see that the painting is upside down. When you flip it right side up, look away from the painting, and the door is now at the bottom of the wall (you can still reach the painting). So, obviously, however you tilt the painting of the castle, the castle will spin to match.\n\nI've only come up with one puzzle where you flip a room upside down to activate a giant heavy switch, but you need to find a way to keep it held up when you put the room back to normal."
6u58ra,Whats the most fingers on touchscreen at once used in any game?,"I'm trying to think of a puzzle game to build where people use up to 6 fingers at once, 3 on each hand, and the puzzle is solved when you find a high enough scoring combination of 6 touches. Score would change gradually as you slide fingers along the screen, and parts of the screen change color depending on how much they would raise or lower score (but its the combinations that matter, not the individual touches), while you live entirely in the moment, score not being affected by the past. No limit of how fast you can solve each level. In the simplest case, a different resistance between each 2 parts of the screen would subtract from score whenever you touch both at once (npcomplete math). Such a paradigm of many possible games, are simpler than Candy Crush while potentially much harder, and difficulty and style could be adjusted in artistic ways. A baby could play this category of game's simpler puzzles, while strategy could exceed what Einstein could reach, of the same kind of puzzles but more tangled. Its the game content its hard for me to imagine. Math experts are well agreed on the hardness of such category of puzzles. Or it could be any kind of smooth puzzle.\n\nMaybe it would help to imagine such a game to know what other games use the most fingers at once?"

6u0l1h,Evaluation of my idea.," I would like if you could tell me how to improve my idea. At the end I also have some questions. I would be pleased of you could answer them. By the way, the art style is low poly, with bright colours. \n  \nThe core idea is a racing game where each level has 4 to 7 paths, that intercept, and you can go on any of them.  You start on one end of the map and the goal is to get to the other end.  There will be weapons, but instead of damage they would change the speed and handling of the targets car in some way. \n\nYou are allowed to changed your vehicle 2 times, and pick from 5 you own,  which you put in a set,  and pick before the match starts. Each match has 5 rounds, each round one race on a map. You get points for where you finish. There will be fuel,  but no pickups. You also cannot see what position you or anyone is in. \n\nQuestions\n1. Any map ideas?\n2. How do I make the vehicles feel good? \n3. How do I make the paths balanced?\n4. Can a beginner do this?\n\nEDIT\n\n5. Has anyone done this before? \n \nBy paths I mean roads. You can get a off road vehicle and go off-road if you want. "

6ttw63,"A silly multiplayer shooter game with weapons such as dual finger guns, a fidget spinner that stuns people, a party popper that gives splash damage, and a spork.","The game would obviously have no coherent storyline, but each weapon would be relatively balanced as to make the game fun. \n\nDual finger guns work like guns, but are make out of the characters' fingers. Players stunned with the fidget spinner are stuck dabbing for the duration of 2 seconds. While stunned, they cannot deal damage, and move at a very slow rate. The party popper is like a shotgun, except it is a bit more festive. The spork is a melee weapon. Of course, these are only a small selection of items, and any finished game like this would probably have dozens of weapons to choose from.\n\nThere could be a variety of fun gamemodes to play such as deathmatch, capture the pez dispenser, and king of the couch.

6r7ynn,Town of Salem (But Not Town of Salem),"If any of you have played 'Town of Salem', the web browser game, you already know what most of this game is going to be about, you'll know how it's going to function etc. My idea though is to take this game, and turn it into a first person game with interactive doors etc.\n\nIn 'Town of Salem', there are roles which are randomly selected for all 15 players on the map. One of these roles are serial killer, which is what I will be using in this example.\n\nWhat I propose is, instead of clicking on a name and have no animation on the killing (like in the standard game), players can pick who they want to kill, and manually walk over to the house of the player they have selected, and stab them. (if that makes sense, I haven't slept in ages so it does to me).\n\nThe game will include good visuals/graphics - (doesn't have to be the BEST, like ARK survival evolved maxed, but something that look like shit, ya know?).\n\nP.S - If you got no idea what Town of Salem, hence you probably got no idea what any of this means.

6r2h72,"Mobile game inspired by Pokemon GO/DWM, offline and better for rural players","#BACKGROUND\n\n**DWM =** [**Dragon Warrior Monsters**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Warrior_Monsters) for the Gameboy Color. Breeding and training are very different from Pokemon. In Pokemon you breed monster A and monster B and get monster A. Breeding two monsters in DWM usually gets you a new monster, the two parents go away, and the baby gets a bonus for being bred. Monsters that come from a long line of breeding naturally have a higher max level and other stats than monsters caught in the wild. You can get almost every monster in the game (aside from a couple very weak and common ones) through breeding the basic monsters found at the beginning, although it's easier to just catch monsters further down the breeding tree. The monsters will randomly join you after you defeat them; feeding them treats during the battle increases the odds.\n\n**Pokemon GO** is a mobile game where you walk around outside in the real world to find Pokemon, Pokestops (get items), and Gyms (compete with other players). The frequency of all three of these necessary things is based on how much cell phone activity occurs in the area. If you live in a fair-sized city like I do, it's great; there's always a few Pokemon within a block or two, and there are plenty of Stops and Gyms nearby to visit. If you live in a small town, maybe you only have one Gym and Pokestop, and the Pokemon are much rarer. You also need an Internet connection, and since the game is designed for you to be outside, you will almost always be using your Data.\n\nI really like that Pokemon GO gets me out of the house and walking around. I don't like that I need to use Data to play the game, and I also don't like that rural players are at an extreme disadvantage compared to players living in more populated areas.\n\n-----\n\n#GAME IDEA (mechanics; minimum viable product)\n\nLike Pokemon GO, the player would need to turn on their phone's GPS and walk around. The game would be available offline; the monsters would be generated procedurally using the phone's clock and location. There could also be item drops (Pokestops) generated the same way.\n\nNot sure yet of the best capture method. I'm thinking it would be battle-based, like DWM and the actual Pokemon games, where you fight other monsters with your monsters. Might use nets or bait?\n\nMonsters would gain experience through training. Like DWM, you could breed two monsters together to get a new monsters with a bonus. Monsters would have a maximum level which could be raised through breeding. Hatching eggs would happen while moving. Driving in a car would be less effective than walking or biking, but would still hatch the egg.\n\nOne of the more difficult parts conceptually will be designing enough monsters to make the game interesting. I'm thinking the four elements + dark and light, cross those six ""types"" with various animal kingdoms (mammals, birds, fish, etc.) and then maybe a few different tiers (like 1-3 star monsters, which could be added to later down the line).\n\n-----\n\n#POSSIBLE ADDITIONS\n\nGame mechanics that I definitely wouldn't worry about until I had an actual functioning game:\n\nPvP/co-op, either through Bluetooth or the Internet (would have to deal with server costs; lack of availability is a common complaint about Pokemon GO)\n\nStationary training? Still require going outside to catch new monsters, but provide some sort of alternative when you want to play/progress without moving. Could be something active, or maybe you can assign a couple of your monsters to ""training stations"" to slowly gain experience while the game is closed.\n\nUse Samsung Health/Fitbit/Jawbone/etc. to give game bonuses based on steps while game is closed (I really dislike that I need to have Pokemon GO open and I need to touch the screen every five seconds to register distance walked).\n\n-----\n\n#REQUESTED FEEDBACK\n\nAs I mentioned, there are some parts of Pokemon GO I like and some I don't. What sort of mechanics/aspects from Pokemon GO would you like to see in this game, and which ones do you wish weren't there? If you're familiar with DWM, which parts do you like more/less than Pokemon?\n\n-----\n\nNote: I did discover GPS Monster Scouter while searching this sub, and will try it out tomorrow.\n\nTl;DR\n\nMobile game, walk around to catch/train monsters like Pokemon GO. Works offline, spawns aren't based on population like Pokemon GO."
6r2dno,Prison Jailbreak,"There isn't a good first person multiplayer jailbreak game, or singleplayer for that matter. I was thinking about the cs go Jailbreak servers in which guards (around 15 online people with guns) order around prisoners like simon says, while prisoners look for little opportunities to run away or stab a guard or grab a weapon. It's really fun even though its just a little side custom game mode within cs go, so I was thinking about something more elaborate, maybe something that focused on the rush aspect like that, so online matches lasted maybe 30 min to an hour max, or if it was singleplayer it could go on for days.

The name itself would come from the main mode, where the people would either be the crew of a bomber (The B-71), with the positions of 2 flank and one rear gunner; 1 Pilot; 1 Navigator/Radar specialist; and 1 Bombardier or a squadron of fighters (Heretiks). \n\n*B-71*\nThe success of their mission depends on the different crew members of the B-71 working together, even filling in for the roles of another should they get killed by enemy fire if necessary, with the roles being as follows: \n*the Navigator making sure they stay on course to their target, while also watching the radar for enemy bogies\n*The Gunners trying to keep them of the ship by going to the bubble turrets above and below, the tail and fore guns, or even just the guns on the sides of the plane\n*the Pilot's main goal is getting them to their target location and back alive, not an easy thing to do as enemies and ground base flak cannons are everywhere\n*the Bombadier is in control of the main payload of bombs, as well as the deployment of whatever other rockets, torpedoes, of chaff that the B-71 has \n\n*Heretik*\nOn this side, the aliens are in control of a series of fighter planes, the most common of which has been dubbed Heretik by the human side, mostly because they can't really talk to each other. Heretiks are very fast, nimble, craft, with a variety of patterns to them:\n*the Scout pattern flies at speeds which makes even the other Heretiks look slow in comparison, their large radar arrays giving them a commanding field of view and much better chance of actually tracking the B-71 down, maybe jamming their radar and coms navigation in the process, even if their own weapons are too weak for anything other than picking off the flank gunners or finishing off an already damaged engine.\n* the Fighter pattern is the standard pattern of craft, moving fast enough that they could catch up to B-71s easily, nimble enough to dodge their fire, and powerful enough that they could take a B-71 down with time. However, a few good hits will still take them down, and it will take several passes to do so. \n*the Exterminator pattern makes up the bulk of B-71 kill's, being tough enough to withstand their incoming fire while also strong enough to take them out with a single volley of well place missiles. Unfortunately,  the Exterminator is slower then the B-71, meaning that it needs the other classes to set up a good ambush point for it.\n*the Psycho is something else all together, moving at a speed similar to the Fighter, and being easily the weakest to fire. Where it's strength lies is using unnatural fields fired from it guns to cause havoc with the crew, distorting the world around them in ways that scar with nightmares, and leaving other nasty surprises in the path that they either think the B-71 will take or trick it into taking.\n\n*The game itself*\nThis would consist of a large, target rich map, there being ~10 of them spread out across an entire continent with the missions working much the same way they would in B-17. The game would consist of 5 rounds, the goal of the B-71 crew being to successfully bring down at least 3 of their ground targets while the goal of the Heretiks would be to take them down. The main thing would be that the Heretiks would have no idea which target the B-71s would go after, needing to fly combat patrols over the waters and skies until they got a sighting report, then swarming over to fight the B-71 as best they could, especially since a single Heretik would have very little chance of actually bringing them down. Meanwhile, the B-71 would have to try to avoid the flak stations and fighters in the air, ignoring the spinning world as they try to line up the perfect run on their target. \n\nTo help keep things fast past, games would be about 10 min per round, \n*a 2 min planning period, where the B-71 will choose it's next target and the Heretiks can swap out their configurations\n*a 1~2 min period where the B-71 is flying over open water, giving the crew a chance for final preparations while the Heretiks being their scouting missions\n*a 2~3 min period where the B-71 is over land, possibly tripping observation domes and flak towers along the way to it's mission point.\n*a 3~5 min escape period, where now the B-71's location is known, and it is a matter of getting home before their luck runs out. Even better, the Heretiks will be able to spring their ambushes or other attacks, as the B-71 will have to return home, and there is enough time to take it down.\n\nRankings would be rated for the distance from base of the target, which will stay destroyed between rounds, as well as the importance of it to the enemy for the B-71 crew, while the Heretik pilots will get points for tracking down the B-71, destroying it, and a higher ranking if they managed to keep the target in tact.\n\n**The Conclusion**\nIf you are interested in this idea, just let me know, and you will be more then free enough to do whatever it is you want with it. The main reason I do want to know is because, if you do actually make the game, I think it would be fun to play, and also because I might have thought of something else to add to the idea if you are interested.\n\nThank you for reading, and have a nice day."
6qwni6,Darth Vader & The 501st!,So I came up with a game Idea for star wars and if your interested in talking about it with me on here. Here is the video I made about it and you can give me your thoughts on the game I propose afterward! https://youtu.be/CbTmrDp25Yk
6qvz6j,Simulation/management/builder game ideas,"I have a big thing for anything simulation/management based. Banished, cities skylines, oxygen not included, simcity series, sims, dwarf fortress, kerbal space program, factorio, prison architect and so on. I love it when the player is given a sandbox world to play around in, given somekind of tools or entities that are given tasks and everything just works nicely(or blows up).\n\nI've been getting into practicing making such games. Started out with simpler stuff, such as lemonade stand simulator, small city builders, banished close and so on, but i'd love to hear some ideas. It's surprising, but I just don't even know what exactly I want to make. I've done the individual mechanics and pieces of most of the games to know how they work, and yet I can't piece them together into an actual idea.\n\nIn some way i'm leaning towards something very relaxing and tried doing a wildlife simulator, so they breed in the world and you're given the ability to move stuff around. Yet it felt like something major is missing. That's jsut an example, the idea can be of any theme."
6qvwuo,Merchant Announcement - R&D #1,"##Hello everyone ! the [Merchant Team](https://ibb.co/nnirUk) here, we hope every ones been well.  We've been busy ourselves, sorting out new projects and learning along the way.  Were popping in just to get some user feed back and ideas on something we are building next.  So without delaying here it is !\n***\n***\nThis is for one of our current projects, **[Project Black](http://imgur.com/gallery/SiUov)** (Before you read any further if you deeply care for your incremental games lives we suggest you spread the word about this post to lovers of incremental games, and try to reach as many as possible, so we can gather more Intel, it only helps bolster our message and also what can be achieved, obviously if you go as far as just giving input here, that helps too).\n***\n**Question One:** \n\nIncremental games can be really addicting and as Clicking bad and a dark room go,amongst many others they were quite popular, however some found that they wanted more after completing the initial game.  **What would you have wanted feature wise to extend these types of games ?**\n\n(unique as possible answers please, be crazy^insanely^CRAZY^okay..^not..that^..crazy with ideas please, what would **you** have wanted, do not be shy). \n\n***\n**Question 2**\n\nMore specifically, how did you feel when playing these games ? when you were playing ""clicking bad"" did you relate to the TV show it was based on, or did you not watch the show and just loved running a empire ? did you ever imagine the progression in your mind unravelling whilst playing ? Which brings us to the next question **At the end of your session or upon completing it, did you not care anymore, or did you want more content ?**\n\n***\n\n**Question 3** \n\nUpon playing incremental games, again such as examples stated above, **do you ever think they lack base features, such as other features that tend be in other genres ? or do you think they need to have more accessible extras ?**, such as profile lists (for more users than one, on one device), or perhaps an extended end game system, which would work as a prestige system as an example, or perhaps a form of mini game, visual or not.  \n\n***\nThis ""short survey"" if you will is aimed at you the player and catered towards you the incremental crowd, please be honest and be imaginative there is no wrong answer, just think back mostly to when you finished these products, we have ideas of our own, but we mostly want fresh perspective.

6qrjsh,Looking for a beginner project to work on,"Hi, I started working with Unreal Engine and Blender a while ago, I've made some simple projects, I'm looking for an idea to make into a simple game.\n\nSuggestions?"
6qpkfz,VR Horror in a Wheelchair!,"What is the biggest issue facing VR games right now? Its the movement. Combining motion controls with VR sacrifices a players freedom of movement. However there is a perfect solution to this that would also serve as an incredible premise for a horror game; put them in a wheelchair!\nThat's right. While playing, the player would sit in a standard chair. To move, they would put their hands next to their hips and sort of toss them forward. In game, their character is actually in a wheel chair, and they are effectively grabbing the virtual wheels and giving them a spin. They can turn left and right by turning the wheels in opposite ways, and can also move backwards.\nNow apply this control scheme to a horror game. It takes place in, say, a hospital. The scary things will be chasing the player in a wheelchair, and they will frantically be spinning the wheels trying to escape; all while having the ability to turn their head around and look at the pursuing horror. \nThe mechanics could also incorporate the ability for the player to crawl around without the wheel chair, simply by using their arms to pull themselves along the floor. This creates some even scarier scenarios. The monsters can smack the wheelchair, sending the player flying out of it. The player can fall down stairs. Perhaps there will be moments where the player must explore an area without their wheelchair, crawling in dark, cramped spaces while something stalks them.\nSome issues; the constant arm gestures might get exhausting, the pace would be slow, and I imagine VR would be hella expensive and difficult to dev for. But I think this would have the potential to be one of the scariest games ever made. "
6qo659,Location based mobile MMORPG with story driven content,"To those that are going to downvote for just reading the title and those who will claim that it's a copy of Pokemon Go, calm down and please read until the end. I'm a big PoGO and Ingress fan, and I have spent many hours into those games. I know their appeal, but they need improving. Ingress has almost no gameplay and PoGO only has ball throwing and an very limited combat system. \n\nWith that being said, I'll try to describe the idea as detailed as I can.\n\nIntroduction:\n\nThis game aims to provide a more detailed social experience than MMOs by actually meeting people in person. But it also has to be a satisfactory solo experience. \n\nIn the game, the player will control an creature called Free Entity. This Free Entity looks like white smoke that is able to transform into an anthropomorfic figure when attacking an enemy, and tasked by a mysterious being called Gyro to cleanse the world from the domain of the Borough. The Borough is a group of very powerful creatures that enslave a another type of creature called the Rotten Entities that act as their guardians. This will be the main conflict presented to the player, but things might not be as it seems through the plot.\n\nGameplay:\n\nThe game will use the players location to move the Free Entity around. The Entity will be able to encounter 6 types of stuff. \n\nThe first one is an Encounter. The Free Entity will find a random Rotten Entity and it will fight it. The fights will heavily rely on dodging AoEs, projectiles and melee attacks from the enemies and then counter with your weapon of choice. The player will select a class that determines their kind of weapon, and their role in the group fights. After the encounter, the player will find some loot and currency. \n\nThe second one is the Shrines. This game won't be focused on farming. One of the things I apreciate about Niantic games is that they don't forbid you from playing the game, but they dissuade people from farming too much. That's why you keep running out of XM in Ingress or Pokeballs and Stardust in Pokemon GO. That's why this game will have an energy bar that'll deplete with every fight. You'll be able to recharge it in the Shrine. Energy in this game will not be recharged by time or microtransactions, so Shrines will be a very important part of the game. They will be randomly put in the map, unlike Pokestops and Portals, so rural players will have an equal chance to city players.\n\nThe third one will be Outposts. These will be like Encounters but with more enemies. This will usually be for higher level players but will have better rewards. They'll appear randomly.\n\nThe Forth one will be Lairs, that'll be content for 3 people of different classes and roles. The gameplay will be different in order to make a satisfactory coop experience. There will be different stages with bossfights that'll require some strategy. This Lairs will appear randomly on the map but will stay for a couple of days in the same spot. These ones will have a level cap for obvious reason.\n\nThe fifth one will be Towers. These ones will be associated with in-game events and many people will be needed to complete them. They'll appear randomly on the map but they'll stay in the same place for a week, to help player planning. They will have direct narrative impact on the lore of the game.\n\nThe sixth one will be Rotten Shrines.  These ones will feature narrative elements, as well as fights and puzzles. They'll be like Story Missions but you'll be able to do them independently. They'll appear randomly on the map. They'll be solo content.\n\nWorld Map:\n\nThe game won't feature real life locations. PoGO and Ingress heavly rely on them for their respective core mechanics bht I don't think they are that necesary in a location based game. From a developer standpoint, this isn't a easy thing to do, but it certainly isn't impossible. I've seen many apps on the Play Store and App Store that use your location and display it on a map.\n\nThis would be the main challenge to overcome, and that's why I'd love to hear suggestions from a developer on this part.\n\nNarrative: \n\nThis game will feature a non-linear structure that'll manifest itself with an opening cutscene, but will be developed with Solo Content and In-game coop events. This type of content will reward the player with some lore of the game that makes the world of the game easier to understand to the players that dare to invest some time unraveling the pieces given by the writer, kinda like Dark Souls and Bloodborne. I already have most of the lore outlined, so the only thing left to do in terms of writing is to write it down in a draft. \n\nI also want to include a choice system that determines your alliegances within the game's world. Most MMOs give a choice of joining a faction at the start of the game, but here the choice will be made by the actions of the player in the story content. This choice won't make any significant difference in the gameplay, but it will have deep lore implications, and the story will have some twists and turns, so if you want to join some faction at the start, you might not be able to join that faction at the end.\n\nMonetization:\n\nPreferably, the game will feature paid customization options, but the game itself will be free.\n\nConclusion: \n\nAn that's it. I have given this game idea a lot of thought. As a big fan of location based games, I want to ser the genre evolve. If you felt inspired by this idea or want to disscus thr idea any further, consider contacting me via PM and I'll explain some more details. If you think this idea cannot be made or it's impossible to do feel free to make constructive criticism. I'm an amateur writer, but I'm also trying to learn programming, so any advice on that would also be apreciated. I'm not a native English, so forgive me if I make grammar mistake and I'd gladly correct them."
6qn1sr,Open World Cold War Berlin Spycraft," I had an idea for a sandbox video game set in cold war era Berlin.  The wall separates east and west and creates a difficult barrier to cross due to army and police presence.  The game will be Grand Theft Auto style in the fact that you can steal vehicles when you need them, but it will work against you, and you can purchase apartments to use as safehouses.  \n     \n You can start the game working for the Russians or the Americans and choose to be a double agent if you are so inclined.  Missions would be quest style and they could be anything from assassination style to Intel gathering.  Missions take place on both sides of the wall,  this is because you have to keep the other country from extracting Intel or people from your side.  Missions will take planning as you will need to arrange transportation, a cover id, and sometimes a disguise.  You can steal cars if your plan falls through, but it adds to your notoriety.\n    \n The notoriety system makes the army and police notice your activities faster, sometimes they will even intervene on your activities during a mission.  Noticed assassinations will add to your notoriety just as stealing cars in the open and having a firefight with the police/army.  If your notoriety is too high, your cover id will fail if you don't have a disguise.  Finally, if your notoriety gets too high, you will fail the game, because no spy can work when everyone knows them.  You can lose notoriety by doing counter Intel missions.\n   \n  This game isn't an RPG to its core, but the elements of one exist.  You need experience to obtain special experimental gear, and you will need Intel to develop those pieces. You gain experience from the missions you do, and Intel is derived from how high value a person you brought across is.  The better gear you have the easier missions will become. \n\nThanks for reading, I got this idea after watching a movie and couldn't sleep till I wrote it out.  Feel free to expand on my idea and tell me what you think.  Thanks again."

6qmwy0,Meow Of The Wild,"Meow Of The Wild is an online open world survival game that I think should exist and It should be for PS4\n\nThe game would have very beautiful and realistic graphics and animations and you can be a cat online or play singleplayer. You have no missions or objectives.\n\nYou would be able to have a mate and make kittens and fight and hunt and climb trees and lay on branches and pounce down on anything you want and also pin down other cats and you can slit their throat by rapidly tapping X fast and they would have to rapidly tap X fast to escape the pin by kicking you off.\n\nYou would be able to swim and lunge at other cats and eat your prey and also become a house cat if you come back to the same house and making the human like you enough and get attached to you to take you in and eat the food they buy and drink the water they give you and when your bowls are empty they would refill them if you meow a lot to get their attention and be by your bowl so they can see. You can also leap on fences and walls and dumpsters and trashcans and kitchen counters and anything basically. You can hunt for food in the forest or find food in dumpsters and trashcans or check the dumpsters of food places or snatch food from people off the street and they would chase you until you get too far away and call you names and you can live in the city as a stray by finding a place to sleep..like a tipped over trashcan or in a alley somewhere and there would be online players or a.i. cats that would attack you or steal your food...the a.i. cats would travel by themselves or in groups of 4 or 5 or less and if you can also become friends with a.i. cats online and in singleplayer and they would follow you and fight with you or for you if you set a target and hunt for you if you command them to. It will be a huge map and a big city and a big forest with pine trees and oak trees and birch trees...many types of trees and rivers and open fields and nearby farms and dens and high hills and streams and lakes and mountains and changing seasons like winter, fall, spring, summer and real time cycle so like daytime would last 30 mins and nighttime would last 30 mins and whole day is 1 hour and in the game you can press the menu button to see the day of the week and the month and the day of that month and the time and the year wouldn't be showing because it's not important so basically it never changes\n\nYou will be able to make Clans and go to the menu to see all the members and remove cats or accept requests or send invitations and change the name of it and there might be many Clans with the same name and you can also leave or join a clan and there wont be no levels so no needing to reach a level to do anything because thats dumb and unfair....anyways you'll be able to customize your cat and choose the breed, gender, age, fur color, eye color, scars, broken leg, declawed or clawed, long teeth and long claws or normal, two different eye colors, and the size of your cat and also change the collars if you have a owner or just a stray cat with a collar, some collars will have spikes and some spikes that look like teeth as a reference to Scourge and BloodClan in the Warrior Cat books or just a plain collar and you can choose the color and have a bell or a name tag on it with your name and you can have up to 10 different cats and change them in-game whenever you want, be a kitten or a young cat, or a adult, or a old cat\n\n\nThe seasons would be amazing, in winter the snow will fall sometimes and sometimes be a light snowfall or heavy snowfall and you will leave paw prints in the snow and cats can follow them and kill you lmaoo and you can be a white cat and be hidden against the snow and in the fall the leaves would change colors and you would see them fall and and be on the ground and people would be in the yard raking and some people wont and the spring would just be when all the flowers and leaves bloom after winter and summer would be summer you know\n\nYou would be able to climb trees and leap into an open window to a house and get food and leave without getting caught and if you get caught by a human they would either want to have you as a pet or yell at you and you get grabbed by your neck and dropped outside the door and yelled at to leave and if your with a friend in the house they would see the human grabbing you and opening the door and throwin you out and they can run out the door when its opened before they get caught or go back through the window\n\nAnd night time will be amazing the moon will light the whole map up...its gonna be moonlit as in you can see yo shadow and the moon gonna shine so bright and the game is gonna run so smooth, no laggin at all\n\nYou will be able to see on the menu the whole map and where everyone is at and cats who have a owner and there house and they can let you in the house and share their food and water or you can sneak in whenever the human opens a window or through the cat flap on the door which they all get once a cat is made their pet and you can text chat or voice chat and there will be up to 100 cats in a session because the map is very big and stuff and there would be different cities and towns to go to and different forest and mountains and also a area of the map where it's always snow and there would be a snow covered mountain with a cave you can live in or live in the multiple dens on it or around the map also you can pee to mark your territory and cat around would get a message on their screen saying you entered (username)'s territory and if its a clan all the cats in your clan can mark the territory and it'll say you entered (clan name)'s territory \n\nAlso you can stalk and crouch low to the ground or anywhere to not be seen and leap onto other cats and bring the down or lunge at them and knock them over and they can dodge it if they are fast enough and if you lunge at a cat on the edge of a cliff and they dodge it...you'll go falling off and die or survive if its not a far drop like on a tree or rock or dumpster and if its a far drop but not far enough for you to die, you will break one of your legs and walk with a limp until you get killed or get a owner and they will take you to the vet\n\nYou can mate with online players or a.i. cats and carry your kits and they grow fast as the time goes by, each month they get a year older and your cat stays the same age forever until you change it and if your a female your kittens will drink your milk from yo nipples and stuff and the birth of them isnt shown and neither is the mating and you can choose rather the name tags of other players show or not and also you can play in first person or third person and roleplay and stuff...and the stuff you do in a session affects the whole session so if you knock over a dumpster and leave another player would find the dumpster knocked over and the graphics would be amazing very very amazing and realistic... Same with animation\n\nThe prey you can hunt is mice, rats, squirrels, sparrows, voles, rabbits, hedgehogs, different types of fish, all different type of fur colors and the predators would be foxes, dogs, badgers, wolf, mountain lion, bears, snakes, hawks, owls, \n\n\nThere will be mean stray cats or good stray cats in the cities, neighborhood, or forests and all over the map, you will see a.i. cats fighting each other and hunting or being hunted and you can help them or watch them die and you can bring food to cats who are young and cats who are hungry and you can befriend them and they would join your clan if you want or just be friends and sometimes come to your house if you have a owner \n\nThe controls will be like this\nPress R2 to switch from run, fast walk, to walk, to stalking\nPress [] Square to climb trees, jump in place, leap onto stuff\nPress O Circle to fight and claw and bite whoever your fighting\nHold [] Square to lunge at cats and knock them over\nPress the right pad button to eat and drink \nPress ∆ Triangle to switch between sit, lay down, sleep\nHold O Circle to catch fish from the water sources\nPress the up pad button to pick up prey, food, kittens, and small stuff in houses\nPress the left pad button to switch from meow, hiss, yowl, growl, purr, and squeal(if your a kitten)\nPress the R3 analog to make the cat sounds shown above\nUse R3 analog to move the camera around\nUse L3 analog to move the cat around\nHold L1 to pee and mark territory\nPress L1 to leap on a cat and pin them down and tap X fast to slit their throat(if you are pinned then tap X fast to escape a pin)\nPress X to crouch\nPress the down pad button to bring up the text chat and press it again to bring it back down(it'll appear on the bottom left side of the screen)\nHold the down pad button to use text chat and the ps4 keyboard would show up\nPress big middle pad button in the middle of controller to bring up a small menu with a quick cat character changer and the clan editor and to see the map and on singleplayer you can change the date and time of day and weather and season\nPress the option button to bring up pause menu which has the map and the clan editor and cat customization and singleplayer and online mode and the option to join another session and all the sessions names and hosts and create a session and join a quick session\n\n\n\nThis game will probably never be made the way I'm imagining it in my head but close to it or never be made at all but it is a great game idea for us warrior cat fans and people who love cats \n\nSorry it isnt organized and its many grammar errors i just wanted to hurry up and get this idea out"
6qles0,A new take on zombies,"I just thought about this the other day, and I don't know if it would be possible to have it turn out decently. It's what I see as a mix of Spore and Plague Inc. I'm not going to explain either game, so read up on them if you wish. I'll be writing as if you have already played both.\n\nThe first major concept of the game will be taken from Spore. The game is broken up into multiple major stages, each playing very differently while maintaining the zombie theme throughout all of them. The first stage begins on the microscopic level with the choice of types like parasite, bacteria, virus, fungi, etc. that play differently in the first stage and affect gameplay in the later stages. Once you choose the type of infection, you are placed in the body of Patient Zero. Depending on what type you chose you could be in places such as the bloodstream or nervous system to start. The game then places like Spore's cell stage, but much more detailed. Every choice and action effects the body of Patient Zero. In this stage, your main goal is to spread throughout the body while still keeping the host alive and undergo micro-evolutionary changes to upgrade your infection's efficiency.\n\nAfter taking complete control of Patient Zero the second stage begins. By some means I have not determined, you can infect other hosts when this stage starts. The game then plays like some hybrid of an idle game and the first stage. You are still continuing to evolve your infection while spreading between hosts. After infecting a certain number of people, the third stage starts.\n\nIn the third stage you now have a considerable number of people infected. This is where the apocalypse begins. You can now unlock infection attributes that start to show in the hosts, some more severe than others. They begin attacking other people, which spreads the infection very fast. It then starts to snowball, taking control of the starting town's/village's population within days before the news leaks nationally.\n\nThe fourth stage starts to play less personally, more like Plague Inc. Your main goal is to spread in a semi-tactical way to avoid becoming extinct for reasons such as military or medicinal intervention. Once you take control of the country you are in, you must find a way to leave.\n\nThe fifth stage now begins when the disease is spreading internationally, and your goal is to infect the world's population while halting the production of a cure and prioritizing eliminating militaristic threats to the host. In all five stages you are still evolving the disease. The game ends when the world is infected, unless another stage can be thought of.\n\n\n\nTo be honest, this is the first time I've thought this in depth about the idea. As such, many things may be horrible and need immediate fixing in the eyes of a developer, but because I am not I do not see this. Well, here's the idea and I hope someone can do something with it."

6qho7f,It starts with a concept,"Set in a world filled with demons. As a newly trained exorcist your goal is to rid the world of evil. But no one, not even you can resist even the greatest of temptations. Being the seven deadly sins. Also known as the capital vices or cardinal sins found in Christian literature.\n\nHere's my idea:\nThese seven sins are spirits, notorious demons who can enter our world through hosts, being the players. When you (as a player) embody one of these spirits, you essentially gain perks and a new move-set until the spirit leaves you for someone else. (for example, the spirit leaves your body when a certain amount of time has passed or when you die) I have thought of a number of mechanics for the various sins, each one has to feel unique and be threatening to other players.\n\nIf you have any ideas or things you like to share, feel free to contribute :)\nLet me know if you're interrested to learn more about my concept.\n\nKind regards\nBentieWentie"

6qhjyc,It starts with a concept (RPG),[deleted]
6qhb90,Puzzle VR game with each eye seeing different rooms.,"A game that somehow you end up with each eye seeing different rooms, and these rooms would interact with each other by the player grabbing an object, bringing it to the other room and solving puzzles. The only way that the player would play is through closing one eye and switching the closed eye. \n\nExamples\n* You grab up a key from a room, and with the controller you bring the key to the other room and put it in the lock\n* 1 image splitted into those 2 rooms, and with each eye you see only a portion of the image\n\nI figured it would give a massive amount of motion-sickness or headache. And it would be demanding as well since you would be rendering two rooms."

6qbdo8,Simple mobile runner with quick minimalistic puzzle solving,"Hey, two things upfront. My English is not perfect, so I apologize for that, and I am not a big mobile gamer so not sure if this is really a new idea.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n###__Base concept__ \n A 2D runner where a character is moving through a path of instakill obstacles. Your task is to ensure the safety of the mentioned character by the use of spells, which can affect the environment or the character. Certain obstacles can be traversed only by using spells in an correct order (the puzzle solving part). The character moves either with a constant speed (a few handcrafted story missions) or with constantly increasing speed (free to play mode [possibly randomly generated?] )\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n###__More details__\nYou have a list of spells that you can use to aid your companion, some of those with an environmental effect and some that target your companion directly. All spells are cast instantly, environmental spells will be cast on the next available target (or simply fizzle).\n\n__Some examples:__\n\n-an ice floor which is being cast directly beneath an enemy, making him slide in the direction he is currently facing (possibly into a trap or pit) create a magical bridge to make a pit traversable\n\n-Slow down time on a trap to delay its trigger and by that making it traversable for our companion\n\n-A dash spell for the companion to let him move very fast for a short moment\n\n-A lift spell for the companion to let him avoid moving threats like a rolling boulder\n\nThis kind of mechanics would also allow for some minimalistic puzzle solving, with difficulty being the fact, that you have to solve those quickly because your companion does not stop to let you think.\n\n__Two examples:__\n\n-There is a pit and right behind it an enemy standing guard. You first have to caste the ice floor to get rid of the guard (by making him fall into the pit) and then cast the bridge to traverse it. If you do it the other way, your companion will simply run into the guard and get himself killed\n\n-Several traps are chained together into a ""long trap"", so even if you cast the spell to delay the trigger, you will still get killed by it. You have to use the slow time spell and then use dash to traverse it (the slow time spell should affect the whole chain of same traps, casting it individually for each one would be only annoying, without benefiting the gameplay)\n\nThose are some examples where you have to chain two spells in an correct order. You could also craft situations where you have to chain three spells but I think four would be already too much once the character starts moving relatively fast. I believe the player should be introduced to the spells and the concept of puzzle solving in the story levels.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n###__Story concept__\nPrince XY hears of great treasures and artifacts in the ""whatever-castle"". He decides to claim those for the glory of his father. The king, fully confident in his son, allows him to go on this quest. Though just in case the things go south, he sends his court wizard with him, you. You on the another hand, know exactly the the prince is a moron and that this goofball is definitely going to get himself murdered without your help.\n\nLater on you arrive at the castle. Without any hesitation, the prince recklessly starts charging forward towards the certain victory!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n###__Artstyle__\n Colorful/ funny/goofy/cute\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n###__IF the budget allows it__\n\n-a daily randomly generated castle that is the same for every player and where players can compete for the global highscore (unlike the free play mode castles that are randomly generated after each new try and the score applies only towards your personal highscore)\n\n-some cosmetics for the prince, obtainable somehow through gameplay (currency/random drops?)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n###__Other__\n\nA simple ""special thanks to:"" as credits would be nice. Am also open to discussing the idea of the game in general\n"

6qa3k8,"Experienced programmer looking for a fun multiplayer game idea. Making a game for all of us to enjoy, so please speak up to make the best game together!","Hey.  \n  \nI am just a guy working at a game company as a programmer. But I broke my foot and have to stay home for some weeks. And I need something to do meanwhile.  \n  \n**I am looking for a multiplayer game idea**. Just something tiny and simple, but fun. So I can make a prototype for it fast and we can all start playing it together!  \nI have some good knowledge with creating multiplayer games, and I love multiplayer games, so I will only do that. I got my network code set, network lobby, auto-matchmaking system and ranking system. So we just need a fun idea on top of that!  \n  \nDon't worry, I'm not here to get rich on someone elses idea, as my contract says I cant make any revenue on personal projects.  \nI just want to do this to make the time go by and see if we can collaborate to come up with a small and fun game together.  \n  \n**Some criterias:**  \n\n- Keep the idea as small as possible. I'm aiming to use only two weeks on the first prototype. (No ""survival RPG with MOBA elements"").  \n- The game has to be multiplayer, this way we can all have fun in it together! Preferred a Player versus Player idea, as I feel it is most fun to beat someone else ;)  \n- The game can be in both 2D and 3D, BUT NO VIRTUAL REALITY!  \n- The game should be for either PC or android phones, or both (as it is free to develop for).  \n  \nWhen thinking about your idea, it might help to think about a small fun real life game. Like tag or hide and seek, and see if it would fit as a digital game. Or maybe you got a retro game that would be awesome in online multiplayer?  \n  \n**Let's make something fun!** :)  \n  \n---  \n**EDIT/Project update:**  \n\nI have read all the comments, and thought about every idea that came up. And all of the ideas are somewhat too big. Thing is that I wanted to get a prototype done quickly in 2 days, test it with you and improve on it during my two weeks.  \n  \nSo I decided to try to mess with an old project I had lying around. It's nothing fancy at all, but it can be fun... or not, don't know yet as I haven't tested it.  \nIt is a 2D, multiplayer ""sidescroller"" PvP game. Where players have a bow and arrows. The game is about running, jumping on platforms and shooting your opponent with arrows. It's quite hard to hit the opponent though as you need to draw the arrow (and for how long you draw it, the more powerful the arrow becomes), you need to manually aim it, and the arrow will be affected by gravity (fall downwards).  \n  \nI don't know, I just wanted to make something quick. And as I had a 2d multiplayer platformer project lying around, I just went with it. I already have movement, shooting arrows and win conditions completed now. Just need to tweak it a bit and fix some annoying multiplayer bugs first before we can test it.    \n  \nAlso got an idea about a game which is quite simple (and not sure if it will be any fun). Where you play 1v1 against another player. And you have 2x abilities: attack and block (can't move or jump or anything either). You can attack in 3 directions and block in 3 directions. You can also ""cancel"" your attack, to trick the opponent. Attacks and blocks takes a while to perform. The game is realtime, so it is a game about reflexes and outsmarting your enemies.  "

6q21n3,How to bring back Banjo Kazooie,"Gruntilda is working on her car made out of blocks. She's holding a wrench, laying underneath the car, tightening bolts. Adjusting things here and there. \n\nThe camera pans over. Tooty is being held hostage in a lab tube. \n\nCut to Banjo's house. He receives a letter: ""I have your sister in my base, to get her back you must win the race!""\n\nNext scene, it's back to Grunty. She's getting ready for the big race. Suddenly, Banjo kicks the door open in a feral rage. Gruntilda looks shocked and terrified.\n\n""How did you make it past my traps? This is only the first act! You've got it wrong, I'm at a loss! I'm supposed to be the final boss!""\n\nBanjo storms over to her and savagely beats her to death with her own wrench. It's just horrendous and gratuitously violent. Hard to look at. He shoves her head in the tailpipe and turns the car on, causing it to explode.\n\nUnfortunately, the explosion caused some lab machines and chemicals to have a crazy reaction. A portal to Hell opens and brings forth demons into the world. Tooty is sucked into the portal and the portal closes itself behind her.\n\nKazooie is turned into a skeleton-bird during the reaction. She remains alive and now has demonic powers, which you can acquire throughout the game. \n\nBanjo leaves Grunty's tower and sees the world around him for the first time. It has become a living nightmare full of grotesque demons and decrepit landscape, with a dim green sky. Bats fly all around Banjo. He yanks one out of the air and squishes it to a pulp, then feeds it to kazooie. He takes his first step forward and stomps on a small green lizard.\n\nBanjo's back, baby. And he is not fucking around this time.\n\nThe art style is like Banjo meets Dark Souls and the entire game is just over the top and stupid. Gameplay remains a combination of platformer and combat. You platform your way through horrifying and disgusting worlds, gathering collectibles along the way. The combat system is improved and brutal as hell, think God of War style brutality. You can use skeleton kazooie like a sword, or a shotgun, or use her demon powers. You upgrade her by feeding her souls of boss monsters. The objective is to kill demons, progress through levels, collect everything, and save tooty ofcourse.\n\nKazooie keeps her sassiness but there's something uneasy about her and she ṭ͇͓̐ͮͣͫ̍̀ͅa̵̴̝̭͇͈̩̔ͣ́́̄̈́̚͝ľ̸̦͍͚̲͎̑̃̊ͦ͊̔̄͘k̵̰̗͒ͭ͐͝ş̟̦̥͇̥͈͂̆̽ͭ̎ ̞̪̮̘̖̳ͮ̾̐̊͢l̪̖̟̺̝͗ͬ̇ͭͣ̑̕ͅĭ̴̴̯̙͖̅̔̍ͫ́ͯ͠k̸͕̈́͆̋ͯ͠e̅̆̒̈́̈̉̿̕͏̯͈̲̺̱̗̜ ̳̞͍̺͆̾ͣͮ͛̿̀̎́͠͠t̻̙̻ͦ͆ͬͭͩ̽ͧ͠h͇͓͔̤͔̭̏͑̎̕i̴̡͉̖̭̩̘̠͈̲̿ͤs̛̍̓̈́͏̘͖̪͜.\n\nMeanwhile, Banjo's attitude is one of complete resignation and rage. He's just so sick of this shit.\n\nBasically this game doesn't give a fuck. It's like what they did with conker's bad fur day, except on steroids and much darker. \n\n\nSee, there's no banjo game that could live up to the classics. Instead just give a middle finger to everyone and go crazy. Show that they can do whatever they want with banjo. It'll be so shocking and stupid that people would have no choice but to love it."
6pzlxy,[XCOM Inspired] Fantasy/Medieval Turn-Based Strategy,"I've gotten back into XCOM (because of the DLC announcement) and have been playing a lot of XCOM recently. I fucking love this game; The graphics are great, the progression is satisfying, the customization makes the units more memorable.\n\nI just desperately want a medieval fantasy version. Before anyone recommends fire emblem, I've played them and loved them, but was thinking of something with more freedom like XCOM.\n\nOkay into the game idea:\n\nSetting - Medieval/ Fantasy with heavy inspiration from D&amp;D. Humans, Elves, Dwarves, Orcs, Trolls, etc. who can all be enemy and playable units. \n\nGameplay - very similar to XCOM, but with a different GUI and different classes. I've made a couple mock ideas which combine XCOM &amp; Fire Emblem unit progression. Units start as rookies with basic and promote to either a Warrior (Assult Melee Unit), Archer (Ranged Unit), Cleric (White Magic/Support Unit), Heavy (Name WIP) (Tank Melee Unit), and Mage (Dark/Black Magic Unit). Each class has two prestige classes they have to choose between later in the game. \n\nWarrior can become a Ranger or a Knight. Rangers are specialized in stealth and have high solo target damage. Knights are high defense tanks that focus on diverting attention towards themselves and stunning enemies.\n\nArchers can become Hunters or Marksmen. Hunters specialize in offensive archery with high movement and low action cost for weapons. Also, they can target units allowing for the entire team to hit easier and do more damage to it. Marksmen are similar to XCOM 2 snipers. They are defensive archers. They have squad-sight and are great at halting enemy advancement.\n\nClerics can become Paladins or Priests. Paladins are experts in preventing and mitigating enemy damage. While Cleric, Priests, and other magic users have to use a staff or free hand to cast spells, Paladins can cast their spells through their weapon. They can cast spells that give temporary armor that would lower incoming damage or shields that could take the damage before it touches the character's health. The Paladin can only heal people within 3 blocks of himself. Finally, the Paladin is very effective against Demons and the Undead. The Priest is a master healer. He can heal at great distances, cast offensive/defensive buffs, and later in the game can revive a dead ally (once per battle).\n\nThe Heavy can become a Berserker or an Enforcer. The Berserker is a large unit with high damage and high movement. Unlike the Heavy and Guard, The Berserker isn't forced to wield a two-handed weapon. He is the only character who can wield two one-handed weapons. (Everyone else can have one full sized one-handed weapon in their main hand and a smaller weapon such as a dagger). For every point of damage taken, the Berserker gains one point to his attack making him devastating to targets when he is near death. When taking damage, for the next turn, the Berserker's movement is greatly increased. The Berserker also recovers from his wounds outside of combat much faster than any other class. The Enforcer has a very high armor and high attack, but low movement speed. The Enforcer is a walking battering ram. He can break through weak walls and non-reinforced castle gates without slowing down. He can also grab small/medium sized units to knock out and use as human shields; His damage is limited to his punch, but all damage affects human shield.\n\nFinally, the Mage can become a Wizard or a Necromancer. The Wizard is a master of Black Magic, studying a variety of schools of magic. With each promotion, he is given the option of studying one of two abilities from a random school or magic. Ex. Pyromancy, Elecromany, Illusion, Geomancy, etc. He becomes a jack of all trades being able to fight enemies of various types by exploting their weakness with his various types of magic. Necromancers are one of the most self-sustaining and survivable units in the game. Their base spell returns half of the damage back to them as health and has a chance to resurrect if the spell kills the unit. As they progress, their zombies become more powerful, their ability to resurrect become easier, they gain spells that can resurrect multiple enemies, and can spend an entire turn resurrecting a single unit with all his abilities and skills. \n\nAlong side the classes there are various characteristics the units can have or be given. To Start, each unit has a race that affects their stats and some have inherent abilities that can be upgraded over time. Ex. Wood Elves are sneaky, Dwarves have natural armor,  Halflings consider half-cover as full cover.\n\nAside from their race each character can by chance start with a characteristics or earn/be cursed with/be given.\nVampirism - life-steal move more powerful in the night, weak to white magic.\nBeast Man - once per battle, can turn into an animal, until they choose to end the transformation, are knocked unconscious/ die,\n or are subject to some skill that ends the transformation (bear, wolf, bird) (each beast man only has one animal option).\nThose are just two examples there could be more. \n\nItems- there are many items in each category, but ill just name them and give a couple examples.\n\nOne-Handed (Swords, Staves)\nLight One-Handed (Daggers)\nTwo-Handed (Greatswords, Hand Held Battering Ram, Spears)\nRanged (Bows, Crossbows, Throwing Daggers, Javalins)\nMisc (Shields, Potions, Bombs, Salves)\nAnimal Companion (Horse, Wolf, Raven)\n\nUnlike XCOM, you cannot have nearly infinite recruits. You as the King of your nation have a round table of Knights. The Table size can be increased for more units, but there are only so many seats at the table so you can only have so many Knights at your disposal. To make up for the lesser number of units, each Knight will come to battle with his own soldiers. These units will give the all the XP of kills they get to their respective leader and can be upgraded though research and engineering of new gear, but not through battle. They have lesser customization than a Knight, but can be given names.\n\nThis last part is wildly ambitious, but would be great. A system like the nemisis system in Shadow of Mordor would make the game amazing, but is a very difficult feature to create.\n\nAdvise - I don't really have the goal of the game well thoughtout. Maybe something along the lines of an evil demon army is descending on the world and you have to unite the realm to together against it. \n\nThen have a second mode that is just conquering the known realm against much more difficult players. \n\nSuggestions- This is a very rough outline, but if you have any aspects or ideas that you think would fit, please message me or comment them."
6pvioo,"A zombie surival game, but with a difference.","The game starts (depending on the difficulty) A year or six months or a week before a zombie outbreak.\n\nYou have to get out of a city before the outbreak occurs to a farm owned by a relative.\n\nRandom events take time away from your attempt to leave:\n\n\nTraffic Jams 1-3 hours\n\nMass transit delays (Hours to days)\n\nGet sick (Days to weeks)\n\nSocial events (parties, shopping trips etc, hours)\n\nIf you make it to the farm with time to spare, time would pass by making sure you had food and supplies to spare, as well as constructing barriers for zombie defence.\n\nThe zombies themselves change over time, at first they're the ""fast"" type of zombie, but over time they become the ""slow"" type of zombie, eventually being unable to move. \n\nThe zombies get attacked by wild animals as well as people and the weather helps by drying the zombies out in hot weather and making them fall apart in wet weather.\n\nIf you want an extra layer of science fiction in the idea, the city is controlled by an A.I who attempts to control the situation as best it can."

Guilty Gear's newest style in animation is very similar to how 8 Crazy Nights was animated, thus making it great for a fighting game. There also seems to be a huge lack of Holiday themed fighters.

6plb33,Star Wars meets Elder Scrolls and Fable,"Set in the Star Wars universe, it is open wold like Skyrim. You can choose various races and whether to be linked to the Force or not (Jedi/Sith or merc/space pirate/soldier/etc). Certain ""jobs"" will be race specific. Only humans can be Imperial soldiers, etc. You start in a morally neutral area. Based on your decisions, your morality and the way yout are viewed by world around you will change. The game would be open world with a main quest line but any number of radiant and side quests can be completed at any point. I would LOVE for it to have completely original characters set either well before or well after the movie timelines. Very old characters (Yoda, Maz Kanata) could make small appearances and cameos or give/assist in quests. Preferably no Skywalkers et al. I love Star Wars games and would be beyond ecstatic to find a good story based game (not online only, though could have an online mode) that has a very well developed storyline. I liked the Force Unleashed titles, but just felt they were very restrictive and extraordinarily short. Almost as if they were footnotes. They each could have been DLC to another, full length title. One last thing; have it not on just PC, give us console plebs some love too.\n\nAll this boils down to loose suggestions I would personally like to see. If anyone who could ever make this happen happens to read this post, tweak the ideas as you see fit, but listen to input from the players. \n\nTL;DR Open world Star Wars game where your moral choices affect everything in the game."
6pk845,Stylish Acrobatic Swordsman I,"My idea... is an idea in which you are a stickfigure swordsman, who is cursed to NEVER STOP MOVING, there is no way to stop moving! This is for Xbox One. It is a 2-D game. A to jump, A + a direction in the air is called an ""air jump,"" in which you get a MASSIVE boost of speed in the air. Then, if you air-jump at the ground you do a roll, which can be canceled with a jump. Pressing A next to a wall will let you wall jump. Press X to start going top speed, X at top speed to go to jogging speed. Pressing X in the air will let you do an ""air-blast,"" you can use this twice in the air, and can be used after an air-jump. Hold X on a wall to climb. Press Y to attack, hold Y for a strong attack, of course, this is not how you can kill bosses. You use combination attacks to kill bosses. For example, if there was a flying boss on its last health point, but you couldn't reach it, you could use A to jump, use an air-throw, then an air-jump, then air-throw, and hold Y and up to jump up with your sword, and kill the boss. That would all be displayed on the screen as a quick-time event. These can also be used on regular enemies for extra points, but only as finishers on bosses. This game is clearly about style. A ranking system would be used. Rankings would go as follows: A - 1,000,000 or more points B - 999,999 to 100,000 points C - 99,999 to 10,000 points D - 9,999 to 1,000 points E - 999 to 100 points F - 99 - 0 Points. Your enemies are red clones of yourself. You get one hit before death. The grappling hook is a collectible item, that is required to progress. This is due to a jungle level, where you wield a grappling hook activated by pressing RB and hold a direction on the control stick. If you reach the top of a straight-up grapple, you will drop at the top. The jungle level is about chopping through hang-gliding enemies and leaves while grappling onto trees. The grappling hook can also be used in combo attacks. There are also fast and slow motion triggers. In fast mode, the timer is at normal speed, and now your character is hypersensitive, but also very much faster. It's much harder to do combo attacks. Now, here's the story.\n\nYou are a swordsman who wants to take down the eleven most powerful people on Earth, who secretly control it all. You've already killed one, and they want REVENGE! They put a curse on you to NEVER. STOP. MOVING! If you hit a wall, you do a 360 back flip and keep running, try hanging on a wall? You must bounce off it, whether you want or not. Standing still, you're always at LEAST jogging. Does anyone want to build this into a game? Contact me at avengerkid5@gmail.com."
6pidmk,match-3 zombie game,"12 years after the zombie apocalypse, a group of survivors from Safehaven dare to risk their lives to cross miles of zombie territory for something they only remember in their dreams: sweet, cabonated soda. Zombie Quest: For the Love of Soda.\n\nCartoony, fun feel to the game. Gameplay similar to ""Puzzle of Magic"" where you move survivors around on the map as you make matches.\n\nGame features: \n\n-Collect survivors. I like how in ""World of Goo"", the more goo you save, the more goo you have for the later levels. So in this game, you can save more survivors along the way. Plus they die permanently (maybe can be revived by priest) so the more, the merrier. \n\n-7 classes of survivors that have different abilities. Heals, tank, buffs.. A scientist class may have 1 of 3 special weapon: Lane warp gun - can move an entire lane like a rubix cube (like how the wormhole works in ""Alien Hive""), Unstable Unit warp - warp a unit to random part of map, Weak blackhole gun - pulls zombies to a selected area.\n\n-Not too linear path. This game will have forks in the road so you can separate your group to cover more ground to collect more loot.\n\n-Event spots on the board. A broken car may be on the map and you can put the Engineer class on a spot to hot wire the car to run over zombies. Fix a bridge to cross a river. Chop down a tree to block off zombies for a bit. etc. \n\n-Hopefully 2 modes: turn based or time based for advanced players. \n\n-Global events. Like.. the next city (set of levels) will be released on a certain date, but if everyone collects this many stars (from completing the level, 3 being best) then the city can be released earier.\n\n\ntake whatever ya want from this idea :P\n"

Pulling out a pistol when you run out of ammo feels nearly useless in most games with the draw speeds. \n Sometimes it just turns into who reloads first or who has more ammo. So what If you just clicked a button and it moved your primary to your other hand and with your main hand it quick shot a pistol or something similar to that. You could maybe still have a dedicated button to pull out a pistol. Wouldn't it just be so cool if you were in a heated firefight with someone and when you both are low on hp and run out of ammo you quick draw a revolver/desert eagle and just *BANG* he's dead? I think it would work personally."

6p5ihd,"RPG, Dark Souls-style game where your character can shapeshift into fears of your enemies","So it's pretty much set in a dystopian fantasy world, and the mechanics is pretty much like Dark Souls, Witcher, Prototype, etc.\n\nYour character has the ability to shapeshift into the fears of other enemies and NPCs just by looking at their eyes as their gateway to their minds. And these fears can be stored in your memory to access them and shift into them during gameplay.\n\nYou can become a giant spider, giant snake, a ghost, a weapon. Heck, you can even shapeshift into all the enemies and bosses in the game. Shapeshifting also costs mana, so there are weapons, armors, etc. in game just in case you have no mana and have to battle with guns, swords, shields, etc.\n\nThere would also come a time where the character would ""sense"" a new fear from an incoming enemy or a nearby NPC. Sometimes, if it's an NPC, you have to do a quest just you can look at their eyes and get access into turning a past boss or something.\n\nTo obtain a fear from an enemy, you would have to weaken it, pokemon-style. Once it's stunned, it's your chance to know it's fear and use it against them, dealing double the damage\n\nYou would also have the ability to sneak past enemies and the choice is yours if you want to battle them for experience. You can also read the minds of enemies, making a cloud appear above their heads, showing their fears. If you don't have that fear, fight them and obtain their fear.\n\nMaybe their could also be a Testing Level, where your character is in an empty house where you can test your new fears to shapeshift in and try the attacks and skills"
6p5e7v,Really specific unique AAA zombie game that won't be made,[deleted]
6p2tx6,Elaborate digital + physical RPG I am too poor to make,"So I posted a bit of this idea a while back on here, then took it down because I actually wanted to pursue it, then realized even with the planned Kickstarter I realized it was going to cost way too much. But I put way too much time into it to not at least share my thoughts.\n\n**Overview:** I wanted to create a game called KeyRPG. The game would be based around physical keychains so that you could take them with you. You could buy in packs of three random keychains at the store or online. On one face of the keychain you would have a weapon icon like you would find in most RPG games like WoW or GW2. The rarity of the weapon is depicted by the color of the keychain, white being basic, purple being legendary. Weapons are more powerful by default the rarer they are. Here is a mock up I created when getting pricing and gauging interest from people: http://imgur.com/DzjmZIw\n\nOn the other face, you would have a QR code with an embedded UUID unique to the keychain itself. When you scan the QR code with the app it unlocks the weapon in your inventory, rolls stats unique to that item including effects like poison or piercing, rolls random ""moves"" for hat item, and registers that UUID to your account. Since each QR is unique this enables trading with other player by going to a special trade screen and scanning each other's QRs. \n\n**Gameplay:** The gameplay would consist of an online PVP, there would be matchmaking lobbies based on the number of weapon sets that will be in the battle, I.E each player chooses 1 weapon set, 2, etc. As the match begins players select their weapon sets by scanning the QRs. There are one handed weapons Greatswords, Staffs and Two-Handed like Shield/Sword, Dagger/Dagger, the latter count as one playable weapon set. Different combinations of weapons could have different move/effect combinations. Battle is turn based where you select attacks from the moves your weapon knows and if it ""damages"" the other players set to the point that it breaks you win! \n\nAs you battle and succeed your weapon gains experience and levels up. With enough levels your weapon may be strong enough to compete with higher tier weapons, so a Lvl. 200 white rarity weapon might be able to beat a Lvl. 5 yellow rarity weapon. This makes it less PayToWin as you can still use the basic items if you work hard.\nWeapons also get experience from being scanned once a day (streak bonuses), being traded, win streaks, and other things like that. \n\nWhy even use keychain? The main thing is I like the idea of having a physical token to show off. Some keychains would actually become pretty valuable and rare. Second is it slows inflation of the economy, most games you see everyone and their mother running around with top items, this makes it more difficult to get there. Third I wanted to eventually implement more features like using the QRs as an AR marker to show 3D models of your weapon, then further geolocation based battles and raids.\n\n**Pricing:** I was quoted around $4500 for 5,000 expoxy domed stickers to give it a 3Dish look with a holographic finish to make it more RPG/rare looking. Any less than 5k and it wasn't saving much money due to bulk discounting. This was the price for printing 100 different designs. I was quoted at $0.12 per keychain, that's $600 for 5k. Then I was quoted $200 for the 5000 QR weather proof stickers. \n\nIf prices stopped there it would be about $1.06 a piece X 3/pack = $3.18, sell for $4-5 a pack and profit. But there also shipping, business licensing, server costs, any development help Id need, and the big kicker... graphic design. For 100 weapon icons of varying rarities I was quoted anywhere from $6,000 to $20,000, obviously blowing my pricing model out of the water and putting it pretty far out of the range of a quick kickstarter.\n\nSo there you have it, there was more to it and more thought out but it's been a few months since I touched it I was just pulling this from memory.

6oxxik,Need help sorting out my game idea - 2D Space Adventure,"First of all, I'd like to admit that I'm a tad bit ambitious, with this being my first game and all. Second, I actually have begun development in Unity and have already made a foundation for the following systems: Spaceship Properties, Inventory, Dialogue (with decisions), and Projectiles. Anyways, the problem:\n\nIt's a space game set in 2D, and I wanted to include hidden bases, space stations, a Dyson Sphere (lol ikr), asteroid belts, and more. I was planning for it to be similar to GTA V, where you could steal spaceships and obtain wanted levels and such. Still though, even though those things are probably achievable and would be really cool, I still can't imagine what the core gameplay would look like. It's difficult to motivate yourself to work on something that doesn't have direction.\n\nAnyways, I'll take any suggestions and gladly answer any questions. Thanks!"

6otqiu,FPS with portal style mechanics with an influence from LawBreakers,"So I can imagine it being fast paced and everyone has a gun and may even be class based, but every class has the basic idea of having a gun that doesn't aim in (this is important so that the game stays fast paced and it frees up right click for shooting portals). The game would allow players to build up large amount of momentum by using portals and could even include low gravity areas. Each class could even shoot ports with different qualities but I haven't thought it out enough to explore that idea."
6os2ae,THE WORLD IS GONE! &gt;&gt;GAME IDEA&lt;&lt;,So I was watching a Youtube video and this was inspired by that Youtube video.\n\nPretty much the idea of the game is that you're the last person on earth. Everyone just vanished so there would be crashed cars everywhere. Your goal would to be survive and if possible to make a lot of buildings enterable (such as Gun shops) and in the first days it's easy as there is still power but slowly everything starts going out as it would in real life. You'd need to fortify your home as there is Wild animals excaping and there would be radation everywhere from power plants overheating and melting. Wild dogs everywhere and you'd need to scavange and live off the area. You could enter lots of houses and so forth and hunting would become a large part. Eventually a baby could spawn and you would need to care for it etc.. and restart the population of human-kind while staying alive. The world would become a harsh place and you'd need to scavange and find reliable transportation and as the game progresses things would look older and overgrowth would start.\n\nTell me what you all think! I think it'd be brilliant.
6sdmv3,"[3D Sidescroller, Splitscreen Local Co-Op] Space Ship Commander/Management game. Thoughts?","I'm toying around with a project in UE4 which is a \n\n- 3D side scroller (Can move on XYZ axis, but the camera view will always remain on the side)\n- Local co-op (2 player, controllers required) \n- Spaceship commander game (think: The bridge from Star Trek).\n\nThere will be light roleplay elements with 3 main stats:\n\n- Social: Charismatic stat, useful for positive trade deals, bluffing / intimidating hostile enemies\n\n- Smarts: Intelligence stat, useful for engineering, science, & medical tasks\n\n- Brawn: Physical stat, useful for combat & brute force events\n\nWhile playing the game, you will have numerous tasks you can do around the spaceship that will result in some benefit. Examples include:\n\n- Repair/unlock new rooms\n\n- Gather materials\n\n- Craft shields / weapons for the ship & your character\n\n- Teleport to planets to gather other materials\n\n- Talk with crew members\n\n- Train stats\n\nThe urgency of completing tasks comes in the form of the CRISIS bar, which is a progress bar shown at the top of the screen which slowly counts up to random events (sometimes good, sometimes bad). Good events would be things like:\n\n- Refugees (NPCs) joining your crew, which can then be assigned to certain areas that you might not want to man yourself (e.g. shield / weapon boosting terminals). \n\n- Supply ships returning with materials\n\n- Friendly trade ships hailing the bridge\n\nNegative effects would be more like:\n\n- Enemy ships approaching\n\n- Fires starting in the engine rooms\n\n- Punctures in the ship\n\n- Disloyal crew members sabotaging ship (break key components of ship, stealing materials, fighting with other crew members, etc.)\n\nCo-Op abilities will of course play a large role in the game as well. For example\n\n- The person playing as a commander during a Crisis event could go speak with a hostile enemy and use their social skill to stall the enemy while the 2nd player teleports aboard the enemy ship to take it down.\n- During a combat crisis event, one player could play the minigame to power up the shields & weapons, while the other plays the minigame using the turrent to attack the enemy ship(s).\n\nAs far as development goes:\n\nEven keeping this local co-op (opposed to full multiplayer), I realize this is a pretty ambitious project. So my idea to start off is to finish the main ship, an enemy ship, and a single small planet surface area (all of which could be re-used for psudeo-random events). Anything not covered in that scope would be included in the form of text-based decisions/outcomes (think oldschool Oregon trail). The idea would be to replace as many text-based events with real-time minigames as time goes on.\n\n\nSo, what do you think? My main motivation with creating a game like this is due to a lack of finding engaging couch co-op games around this theme."

6sd8se,Generating landscapes from songs,"inb4 ""go play Audiosurf you fucking donkey,"" this is a little different. \n\nThere are many games that allow you to play your own music library, and I own a lot of them. My library being absolutely gargantuan, and me always being on the lookout for new experiences, they are one of my favourite game genres. However, I find that they don't go far enough.\n\nAudiosurf has a bunch of skin options, especially in Audiosurf 2, and in the original you can even mess with the colours. Symphony changes intensity with the music, and so does Beat Hazard. Riff Racer has a bunch of pre-defined track skins that change with the genre and overall look pretty similar.\n\nThe point is, no matter how fun these games are, there comes the point where you've seen it all. I want that point to be not at the end of 30 play hours, but at the end of my music library.\n\nI want a game to analyse the song in depth and use it as a seed to generate a race track around it. \n\nOverlay EQ and the visible light spectrum to generate colours, maybe increase contrast to make sure everything just doesn't turn out brown.\n\nGenerate shapes and creatures around the track based on the music. Smoother music will generate smoother shapes, music in different octaves decides the creature-to-object ratio, or maybe the creatures should be the enemy. Rougher music, where the waveform is more jagged, should produce more jagged shapes and beasts.\n\nTracks that feel wide and airy should take place in wide, outdoor spaces, while dense, narrow ones should take place in claustrophobic tubes.\n\nBasically, I want a major theme (tileset, meshes, colouring scheme) to be generated, which then changes slightly in ""biomes"" along the way, which follow the way the music changes throughout the song.\n\nUse the song, create a seed from the waveform or something, use it to generate all the random elements. I know little about these things, so all I can do is give you a wishlist.\n\nHonestly, I don't give a fuck about the game part, even. make it a racer, have me shoot blocks, make me chase birds, have me ski down a slope, I just want to play my music library. Send me to weird, psychedelic places and give them a game that can take me to new ones so long as I have songs on my hard drive.\n\nIf anyone actually ends up making this game, I will buy it, and also send them a Fanta orange in the mail. Or Bundaberg Ginger Brew, depending on which you'd prefer."

6saiyq,Axes & Daggers,"So, this is my first post. Be gentle.... Anyways, I've always wanted to see a great Viking game. Quite frankly there's nothing out there. Here's what I've got. It's set in 800 AD in Scandinavia. You're a warrior from a small clan on the northern part of Denmark. From your humble life as a lower warrior you must prove your mettle in battle. You start by paying your dues defending your village from rival clans while the warriors are raiding. One summer the clan from across the river sees the lack of your warriors as an opportune time to take your family's land. You lead a defense with nothing but boys and shieldmaidens-in-training. You crush the rivals offensive. The warriors return, impressed the Jarl gives you full warrior status. During the winter months you must spend your time gathering and managing supplies/trade with other clans. Next summer your Jarls orders the raiding parties to the west. To the kingdom of Mercia. You and your clansmen are few, and land onto hostile shores. After your Jarl leads you through a few costal villages, raiding everything. The king dispatches a large force to attack you. You're overwhelmed. The Jarl refuses to retreat, going into a bloodlust. His rage will lead your clan to doom. He leads a charge into the ranks of heavy soldiers. Being honor-bound you and your clansmen charge as well. The casualties are great. The Jarl falls, chaos descends. Your clansmen are in full disarray with no leader. You begin to shout out orders, the men start to listen, the tide of battle begins to turn. While outnumbered the Norsemen are still vastly better warriors than the Mercia troops. You defeat the Mercia battalion, and through that victory your clansmen raise you to Jarl. From there you work through diplomacy, trade, war, and sabotage to advance your clan. I would love to see elements of city building, resource management, crafting, ect. I know this sounds eerily similar to the plot line of Vikings on the History channel, and I do love that show. What I believe is easily achievable is a phenomenal RPG where you lead a clan of Vikings from a poor farming village into the most feared clan in all of Scandinavia...or you lead them to their doom. Your choices shape the outcome of your clan, your sword shapes the outcome of the world. I also don't have pictured a spinoff of M&B either. I see something much more defined than that. A Skyrim-esk world with the diplomacy elements of a M&B world. I don't know. I could be off my rocker here, but as I said this is my first post. Also think this could be applied to Feudal Japan as well... Thoughts?"
