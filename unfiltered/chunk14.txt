g7n65c,Sim Earth - Unleashed,"The truth is that we, as humans, arent born with smartphones up our inventories. Sims 4 is a dirty, naughty liar. \n\nMany people opt for Sims 2 for its simplicity, complication, and the ability to create custom content. Technology is optional, which helps many like myself create pre-modern worlds. Why not recreate this truth and perfect it?\n\nGive us a game where we can plop a lot in a spore like galaxy, spore build furniture, either be primitive or technologic, conquer for spice, but its sims 2 mechanics! Give us freedom to create great cities, either one lot at a time or whatever, or spacebases. Or take a sim, walk, run or drive to another lot in your village and pick their wooden door, or take a few clans of sims, weaponize them and destroy another village! Our own governments etc.\nLet us make snake-skinned people, or snake-tailed people, or cat people! Let us make clothing meshing, once again, like in spore! Let us save patterns and meshes and share them! Its all so simple\n\nAnd all of it, either online or offline."

g7l1xw,Calling all Unity developers and Builders,"A new blockchain protocol called Qudo is opening the door to token rewards on Unity—the engine that powers half of all video games. It will use the Telos blockchain to enable any game built on Unity to add token-based features, using something called “proof-of-gameplay” reward mechanism."
g7gm4l,Single player open world WW2 RPG,"Map about the same size as GTA V, maybe a little larger...\n\nYou begin the game as an airborne dude in the plane—game starts similar to band of brothers; a cutscene shows your plane getting shot down and you end up separated from your company. You’re behind enemy lines, you lost your weapon and most of your gear in the wreckage. You’re dropped into the middle of Europe with no friendlies around and no equipment—the rest of the game is up to you.\n\nA Witcher 3 story type of format with Skyrim’s freedom to approach/bypass missions and sections of the game the way you please. You can essentially choose your story...who knows where you’ll end up, but on the way you might come across injured soldiers who you can help, and they can act as side quest givers or companions. You may come across a skirmish, where a commander asks you to help them and gives you a mission to take out a machine gun nest that’s suppressing them or something—etc.\n\nYour progress could effect the game world as well—maybe you stumble upon a small village that is being occupied and defended by friendlies—you might have to defend that village from incoming enemies—if you fail to defend the village, then the frontlines shift—mission structure can tie in with how the war progresses—and as the war progresses, missions come and go. There might be a time where the player may need to destroy bridges before invading forces make it to them, drastically changing the tide of the war. Missions designed around helping/ambushing supply lines effecting attrition on relative sides.\n\nThere could be countless ‘classes’ and/or ‘factions’ that the player can take up—similar to the way guilds work in Skyrim—you may here about a camp in northern France that is looking for someone willing to do work as a spy behind enemy lines—doing this story line could grant the player various loot/apparel/rank increase/etc.\n\nIf you ever make it back to your unit or a friendly base, you can be recruited as a machine gunner/sniper/medic/etc...this could allow for various role play and different play styles.\n\nWhy hasn’t there been any (recent) open world single player WW2 games? I’m not even aware of any at all—though I’m sure one exists somewhere. But idk imagine a Medal of Honor style game, but not linear and open world—where the player would be pushed in a certain direction, but would have the freedom to go ‘AWOL’ or do as things the way they please?"
g7fyu0,Open-world time travel game,"Time travel is a concept anyone can relate to and enjoy. What would be amazing would be an open world (and timeline) Game where you could go back in time and influence past events. Stop the JFK assassination, alert the military at Pearl Harbor, etc. Then the game would use machine learning concepts to generate history since you changed things. \n\nThis concept is possible now as a text-based game albeit a huge amount of configuration (for events, people, and more) would be required.\n\nThe game could be made with a similar model to sports simulators like Out of the Park Baseball, Front Office Football, and Football Manager, where the only static thing when starting in the past are the people that enter the game world with their traits. \n\nAs an actual 3D open-world game, we are probably 10-15 years away from it being feasible."

g77eun,Make a unique shooter game based on Counter-Strike 1.6 Warcraft 3 mod (FPS RPG),"Hey guys, back in old days in CS 1.6  there was an amazing created mode called Warcraft 3 mod. There were 9 classes I guess with unique abilites and ultimates and a lot of items that made you even stronger and could power up your heroes' ability, you just had to play for xp to leveling up the abilites and to get the ultimate as well.   \nIt's forgotten but it was so insanely good, I wonder if it will be ever made.  \nHere is now the Valorant which is also like a lot of games was based on unique heroes. But WC3 mode had a nice nostalgic feeling I know it's like 0% chance, but that would be awesome if someone would make it as a new shooter game."

g729xu,Spy Master Game,"A game that plays like most of those Bond/Espionage movies where you are given a file with targets and the information you are trying to obtain. The idea of this game isn't to be a FPS unless you mess up and have to shoot your way out. The idea though is to ask the right questions to obtain the information. \n\nYou might gather information about an individual that helps you build a disguise so you can replace the individual in your next mission and gather more informtion. You will have situations where you will crack computer puzzles and codes to access safes, bypass security measures, stop the killer sattelite from firing on the Capital,, etc. \n\nThere is action as well, escaping on a motorcycle, being chased on snow mobiles, piloting a small plane out of hostile territory, and so forth but the main part of the game is the espionage, the stealth, and the information gathering."
g71zt2,A post-apocalyptic Stardew valley-type genre with a massive open world.,"TL;DR\n\nA top-down 2D tike-based engine similar to Stardew valley. Set in a post-apocalyptic world, your goal is to restart civilization. \n\nLong:\n\nYou, the PC, awaken from an exodus cell. You don’t know who you are or what you are, all you know is that you were meant to awaken. \n\nAfter some minor exploration, you make your way out of the facility you were in and find the first NPC. This character is a grizzled old man who is running out of days on this earth. He teaches you the basics of rebuilding and survival, and then passes his property and equipment off on to you. He becomes the first NPC. \n\nYou can explore a massive open world. All of the NPCs  would be out in the world just waiting for your rescue. You help them and bring them back to live in your village. Each character would have his own demons and backstory, along with unique interactions with the other characters. There would be well-written and thoroughly developed characters that hopefully don’t fall into a stereotype. Maybe there could even be a Judas type character to throw a twist into the story.\n\nThe village would have an amazing building system, with modular building pieces that the PC can “put” together. The building could even change appearance based off of the materials used. The PC can “customize” his buildings to be basically exactly what he wants. The engine would be designed to handle the PC input to generate beautiful hand-designed buildings. The interior of each custom building can even be customized too. \n\nThe world would be very large. Multiple biomes, and riddled with ruins and other hidden secrets. You can get to anywhere from the very beginning as long as you can defend yourself. The world would have collectible and renewable resources for the PC. \n\nThere would be animals, and basic vehicles, and horses, and numerous pets, and all sorts of amazing things to fill the world and make it come alive. \n\nAt the very end, the Judas character would make an attempt on your life after he discovers that you aren’t what you think you are. He is secretly part of a neo-fascist group that existed before the calamity-type event. (Maybe a massive war??) He learns that you are a genetic clone bred from the DNA of the old man’s great grandfather. The old man throws himself in front of the bullet meant for you, and sacrifices his life. \n\n\nYou face down with the Judas character and defeat him. You can choose to either kill him or bring him to your side. The game can then be played afterwards with numerous side quests and hidden secrets. \n\nI’ve always dreamed of a game like this. I’m hoping to start this summer."
g708c3,Borderlands MMO gun crafting,"I don't think we will ever see an Borderlands MMO but I had some thoughts about what crafting could look like if they did one. \n\nEverything would start with a single crafting material that would come in all the same rarity levels as craftable items with one more called ""pure"". Using all of one rarity level of material will produce a component will produce something mid tier. Adding more of the next level material will increase its stats until it flips to being a low tier of the next rarity level. The crafting material can be refined down in to more valuable rarities at the cost of quantity. \n\nWeapons consist of 5 components. A body, internals, magazine, barrel and sight. The quality and type of these components determine specific characteristics. The body would determine its gun type and any special element damage, the internals effects rate of fire, the barrel effects the accuracy and so on. Putting all 5 together will preform a dice roll and generate a weapon based on the inputs. Alternatively, a weapon can be turned into a schematic and will allow a similar gun to be crafted with a specific amount and rarity of crafting resource. \n\nPlayers will make many many weapons while playing. Crafting low rarity weapons in mass is the main way of increasing your crafting skill level. Since other players are not interested in low level weapons they will be sold to the general market. These are the weapons that are found in the world. Just about every weapon in the hands of AI started out as created by a player. The crafter has the option to put their name on the gun and could technically find a gun they made on someone they killed on mission. When making a legendary weapons the crafter will have the option to name it and add a description. Weapons of value can be listed on a market and be sold to other players."
g6xds5,I'm down to make these games in 48 hours if anyone is willing to pay $40 for them!,[removed]
g6w4sd,A game where you are a sniper/artillery spotter on a large battle field.,"This will be a multipleyer FPS on a large open terrain battle field. Large formations of AI troops will move around occasionally engaging each other. If the player wanders too close to an enemy troop formation they get shot and game over. Instead the player drives about the battle field in a motor cycle trying to find good vantage point to spot enemy formations. Once spotted the player can call in artillery. Artillery will initially be inaccurate and the player will have to stay on station and feed back hit locations to help the big guns zero in on target. Other players will be spotting for the enemy team and if the player spots one they can shoot them with their rifle. It will be possible to shoot AI troops with the rifle too but it won't be nearly as effective as dropping artillery on them.\n\nEvery time artillery starts shooting from either side all players will be alerted to where the shots are landing and the race will be on to find the spotter. Likewise when ever formations of AI soldiers clash all players will be informed with the goal of landing artillery on the other team's soldiers.\n\nRolling hills will provide cover for players to relocate around the map, and squads of AI infantry will patrol each factions territory flushing out any artillery spotter that ventures too far across enemy lines. The territory controlled by each side grows or shrinks based on how effective the artillery spotters are at wiping out the other side's infantry. When one side overruns the fire base of the other the game is over."
g6tlad,Games you can make money on,"I know they already have games with this sort of mechanic but I'd like to see more games implement it. A game where you can buy and sell things and make real money on it. Where you'd be able to create and sell individual objects like skins, clothing, armor, weapons, cars, artwork etc etc. And keep things pretty cheap like most things $1 or less. Have the ability to make expansion packs for like $10 that comes with a bunch of themed stuff. Also maybe build houses or bases that you could buy/sell and create quests and whole new parts of the map. I know most developers want to keep all that stuff to themselves but I bet some great stuff would come out of letting people make something off it too. Just look at dreams or LBP where people don't get paid but still make amazing content. Sure they could take a cut but imagine being able to generate some income like $20 a week  or even making a living off like $500+/week selling items in game for real money or hit it huge and sell some rare items that only you have and everyone wants and making thousands and thousands haha. Being able to open up an in game store that you run, maybe even be able to hire other players to run it while you're unavailable. Idk again I know sone games have these sort of things but I'd like to see it more and give players a piece of the multi billion dollar gaming pie."

Production is limited only by time.\n- There is no tech tree to climb. All units are available from the start and their stats are completely static.\n- You have four production buildings.\n    - Each produces units continuously.\n    - You can queue up arbitrarily many production orders.\n    - You can set a default unit that is produced whenever the queue is empty.\n    - Each building can produce all units currently available.\n    - You lose if all four are destroyed\n- Each production building has three supply lines.\n    - The number of supply lines available to a building dictates its rate of production. Loss of all supply lines prevents it from building anything.\n    - You lose if nine out of the twelve supply lines are destroyed.\n- You have one base. You lose if it's destroyed.\n- There are three control points.\n    - To secure a control point, you must have at least one unit on it uncontested for 10 seconds.\n    - You lose control of a control point if you have no units on it for more than 10 seconds.\n    - You win if you capture all three and hold them all for at least one minute.\n    - You also win if you have held control of them for 30 control-point-minutes (e.g. 2 control points for 15 minutes each, 1 for 10 minutes and another for 20)\n\nEverything else comes down to micromanaging units."

g67ukt,"Weapons Please: A bureaucracy game about arms dealing in the style of ""Papers Please""","You play as an arms dealer who is selling weapons to both sides of a long running war between two small eastern European countries. \n\nTo make the most money possible weapons sales must be balanced so no side can win the war. Relationships with the countries have to be maintained as well or they may buy from other arms dealers or worse, kill the player. \n\nIf Country A is looking like they will win the war soon, the balance of power needs to be pushed in favor of Country B. Selling Country A fewer and inferior firearms while Selling Country B a greater number of better firearms would change the balance but also put your relationship with Country A at risk. It would be better to sell Country A good weapons but then let Country B know about the deal so they can steal them. Replacing Country A's stolen firearms with inferior ones shifts the balance of power while preserving the relationship. \n\nOn the opposite side of the coin the weapons are acquired from intelligence agencies from western countries that have three letter names. Agencies will have to be worked with to acquire access to better weapons. They may ask for information on someone in the area or help in arresting them. The benefit of this would have to be weighed against your relationships with your buyers. \n\nOther opportunities to acquire and sell weapons will pop up over time and how you handle them can effect the story of the game. \n\nIf you survive to the end of the war the actions you took will define the ending you get."

g65ewz,Game idea when I was bored and finished my first game :D,"I love games that have millions of items, like swords, weapons, armors, spells etc. and fully customizable characters (sth like BL3 weapons or any rpg with loads of items). And so I had this idea :D\n\nA free 2.5D browser dungeon RPG, where levels are randomly generated and have enemies in them. Each room has a different looking enemies or a mix of what you fought in previous rooms. The enemy levels go up in every single new room you enter. The completed rooms as well as enemies drop all kinds of loot, like swords, bows, guns, armor, boots, skills, pets etc. you name it. Every item could have a tier like legendary, common which would affect item stats. Also each room would have NPC from which you could buy items. Because there is no last room, the levels don't end at a specific number and there is no end to the game. The game can be played in single player and you can join other people servers where you can duel or just play Co-op. \n\nThe game also has a feature where people can make their own items and import them in a ""workshop"", where players can put those items in their own game (something like TF2 workshop, but you can make **ANY** item you want not only weapons it can be armor, enemies, room designs, spells and so on). People can also make scripts to the game and upload them to ""workshop"". The ""workshop"" would have a feature, where you could put desired damage of the weapon, whether it has any bonus effects like burn damage, if the weapon can glow if you put some kind of crystals to it and so on... Basically players can make game for themselves and others. Anything imported can be seen in other player servers. If item has some kind of offensive message or theme you can always block it and block players that have that item imported in their game.\n\nThere would be no such thing as an overpowered weapon, because that's the whole point, because there is no end to monsters and levels. You could teleport to the first room to test your overpowered weapons on lvl 1 enemies or show off at other player servers. So it's an infinite game to play when you are bored. Oh and each time you load up the game you start from the same room you left.\n\nThe game would have no such thing as specific theme, meaning that things can look from stone age times to alien like, but the art style would be pixel because it's my favorite :D."

The final scene would have him be eaten by the monster, whether it be against his will, to avoid capture, or as the final sacrifice to bring his wife back.

As time goes on you can get access to the upper layers where the imperial stormtroopers are a growing threat as well as to the layers below you where anarchy rules. Perhaps you can pvp there against other players.
g5x3cx,Just a good old fashioned Arcade fighter!,"Nothing too crazy with this one, just a classic Arcade fighter! I'm talking a limited roster, like 10 characters MAX, but each with incredibly colorful back stories and designs. Basically taking it back to the early days of Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter. Keep it 2D, and maybe even throw in a couple of gimmicky bonus levels just for fun. Back to basics!"
g5t2d8,A team based CTF/KoTH pvp game ala Quake or Overwatch..but instead of guns and rockets everyone is armed with the moveset from Super Mario Odyssey,"Just a silly idea I got after finishing SMO.\n\nBasically it'd be something like 4 v 4, set in a map with tons of platforms and walls with either a lot of verticality or making the map very long. \n\nIf you aren't familiar with SMO basically there's long jumps, high jumps, backflips, exc you can all chain together in the environment off of the floor and walls and enemies: But you also have a throwable cap that can be used as a projectile, switch trigger, or as secondary platform. You'd attack players by bopping them with your hat or stomping on their head.\n\nThe main issues I see with it is that: Mario from SMO is hellla fast so you might need to make overly large maps or nerf some of the moveset. I also don't think there'd be too much of a metagame for players to figure out since there wouldn't be different weapons/loadouts exc as far as I can tell (not any that would be balanced?)"

g5qi9h,The Climb,"You start off at the base of a mountain in the Amazon. You and up to three friends are searching for answers to the disappearances of a group of archeologists that went to explore the mountain before you. A local guide tells you of the stories of the mountain and tries to stop you from ascending. Obviously you disregard the warnings and start your ascent via a worn down trail. You find some extra gear and a couple artifacts from some ancient tribe that used to roam the area. By the time you reach the archeologists’ campsite it’s already dusk. There’s no other sign of them so you decide to camp there for the night. Throughout the night you hear rustling on the trail and you swear you hear an unknown group of people speaking in a language you’ve never heard before. Feeling it’s unsafe you get out of your tents and continue along the trail in the early morning, still dark. Someone yells in that same language and you see a group of tribesmen running at you with spears. You make a run for it further in to the mountain. As the sun rises you turn behind you and see the tribesmen have slowed and started walking, chatting to eachother. You stop and stare and they seem to not notice your presence. You dip into a small crevice and they walk by none the wiser. What’s going on? They were just chasing us? You decide to follow them and reach a small village just up the trail, in an indent in the mountain. It looks long abandoned yet there are people walking around. They have no idea you’re there as they go about their day. From the corner of your eye you spot a person dart into a building. Clearly wearing more modern clothes, you decide to investigate. It’s one of the archeologists, malnourished and withering away. \n\n     She tells you what’s going on. “These people are but remnants of what once was. There are many like them. During the day, they are unaware of anything not from their time. Something about this mountain isn’t right. It toils with your mind! It seems to drain any amount of energy you have from your body. Yesterday I saw myself passing the village. She... I was like a ghost, I could see through my own body! Whatever this mountain is, it’s separating the body from its soul. Leaving nothing behind but a remnant, a ghost. But there’s something else, something stranger. When night comes, the remnants become real! Self aware, and aggressive! Whatever you do, you must either hide or run! These thing can take quite a beating and you will likely not win in a fight! My friend managed to take one down but they quickly overran him and tore him... limb from limb. Get off this mountain before nightfall, or you’ll be stuck forever. Doomed to walk this god forsaken mountain for eternity. Go! RUN!”\n\n     You contemplate leaving, but you have a job to do. Without evidence you can’t leave, else you risk your job. So you decide to keep going. Night is almost here and you feel a cold chill run down your body. Slowly you look around and the heads of the people turn towards you. You have to run, make it to the top and hopefully find a way to stop this. You need to gather what you can from the village before night falls. But you don’t have much time. The sun is but a sliver on the horizon, and the dead are getting antsy. \n\n      This game idea was brought on by a nightmare I had yesterday. It’s a survival horror game where you must scale a mysterious mountain, during the day is relatively calm, save the wildlife of the Amazon you might chance upon. The remnants of everybody who trekked the mountain before you will carry out what they were doing in their final days alive, over and over again. But at night, the dead become self aware, and aggressive and if they see you, they will hunt you down. You must either fight if there are only one or two, but if you don’t think you can take them, you better run, or risk both starting from the bottom, and having to face your own remnant. For each successful climb to the top, your remnants will disappear, but each subsequent climb will be harder, with more remnants and less supplies. There are relics scattered along the mountain as well as supplies( weapons, tools, food, water, shelter) from past explorers as well as your own remnants. Be warned though. Every time you die your next run will not replenish the items you’ve grabbed before as they will be on your remnant. So pick what you grab wisely, if you think you might not survive, so your next run will have something to grab. The trail takes 7 in game days to complete, not including the first tutorial day. Every time you die, the week resets, but if you fail to reach the top in 7 days, you will get a game over and all your remnants will stay on the mountain when you start over. Making the new game so much harder. \n\n     If you want to make it to the top faster, you can choose to take a risk and make the run at night to the next shelter. But be warned as it will be very difficult to get past the remnants the mark the path ahead as they will follow you inside your shelter. The best strategy in this case is to find and take alternate, rougher terrain that the remnants will have a hard time traversing. But just because it’s harder for them, does not mean it’ll be easier for you. Rockslides, uneven terrain, and even risky jumps and even riskier mountainside scales could put you at risk of starting all over. Note that if your past self falls off the mountain, it will be impossible to retrieve the items on them. So make sure you have a plan in place and the necessary equipment to handle said obstacles. \n\nThe farther up the mountain you get, the harder the terrain becomes and you can even find yourself going in circles. So take in your surroundings and make sure you are going the right way. Building fires is essential when getting near the top as the nights near the top are brutally cold and risk of dying during the night become greater. But beware as the fire can be seen by the remnants so you’ll have to find a place that’s secluded and either out of reach of the remnants or unseen by the main trails. You can find clothing items that will keep you warm longer during the night so you don’t have to light fires as often or for very long. And stacking sleeping bags could possibly keep you warm all night. But that’s a risk you might not want to take. The music will start to pick up when there are remnants closing in on your location so you will know when to put out your fire. You must remain hidden and try not to let them see you at this stage because they tend to get her in groups toward the top more often. So fighting is very risky but the rewards are greater if you can lure one away from the group. \n\n     Making it to the top will allow you to take part in a puzzle that will open up an artifact that makes you harder to detect but more importantly, it lets you get off the mountain. So now, you have to make your way back down, passing all of the remnants on the way. Even though you are harder for them to see you, they can still see you and since your climb, they’ve gathered more into groups so it will be even harder to sneak past or fight. And every remnant you’ve killed will be alive again. However the remnants you’ve killed will not have what they had before you killed them as you now have their stuff, or at least what you decided to grab so if you are over encumbered and can’t grab their stuff it would be wise to sort and throw anything they can use against you off the mountain. However, every item has a durability so if you use it too much and it breaks you may not have a backup. So it can also be possible to stash extra goodies around the mountain in case you find yourself in this situation. Be wary though because the remnants can also come across these items and pick them up if they aren’t hidden enough. No place is 100% safe from the remnants so remember where you stashed the items and hope they haven’t been looted. \n\nNow for the multiplayer portion of the game. Some remnants can be taken over by other players(up to 4) during the night, as a drop in drop out enemy. They won’t be around during the day and the players will be randomly assigned to a remnant. So you could get lucky and ave all the enemy players spawn in a remnant far from you. However, if they do choose, they am an swap remnants and after a 15 second delay, randomly enter a new remnant. Luckily, the amazing of teammates you have determines how many enemy player there will be(1v1, 2v2, 3v3, and 4v4) if you choose to play offline(whether you don’t have internet or are not on a subscription your console of choice) you can do so and be free of enemy players, however, you cannot play with friends without the risk of enemy players dropping in. Enemy players run at almost the same(very slightly faster) speed as the player but have the disadvantage of not being able to enter shelters, or tents. The NPC remnants still have this ability so be careful what you do inside of them.(it should be added that while tents are a good hiding place against the remnants, you will not be able to regain energy as you would inside of a shelter)\n\nSo that’s the rough idea of my game idea. Tell me what you think and if you would buy this."

g5fqt9,VR Cycling Sim with Specially made Exercise Bike,"Imagine a specially made exercise bike which measures how quickly the player pedals and so, accelerates the player character accordingly. The player can increase the resistance of their exercise bike so that the player character accelerates faster, much like how changing up a gear typically enables a cyclist to accelerate faster. However, the resistance of the exercise bike would also increase when the player character cycles up steeper inclines unless the player changes down a gear to maintain acceleration. The reverse would also be true, once the player character cycles downhill, the resistance of the exercise bike would decrease accordingly."

I've asked multiple subreddits opinions on the idea but I want to make SURE this is a game people would want. Essentially it is a local multiplayer minigame compilation called Child's Play. It's a game based on your favorite childhood games such as dodgeball, capture the flag, floor is lava, etc. I'm also thinking about adding a singleplayer story mode where you have to take on bullies and potentially down the line an online multiplayer system. \n\nI curreny have a almost fully functioning dodgeball but before I continue I want to make sure people are interested in this idea"

g59z0m,Project AFTERLIFE,"Overall Traits of Game:  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\- Text-Based\n\n\- Uses input commands (ex: ""PICK UP LAMP"")\n\n\- RPG elements (turn-based combat, leveling up, spells, new moves, etc.)\n\n\- Open World (probably)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe World:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince there are numerous areas I want to add in the game, I can't name everything. But here are some of the locations that are open to the player as soon as they start (working titles):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\-     ""The Haven"" - The starting area is a small room surrounded by trees. This is where the player can get used to what the different commands are. The player's hat is also hanging off of a tree branch nearby. The player can decide if they want to pick up or not. This introduces players who are unfamiliar with this genre to inputting commands . Also, since the hat is never actually described, it can look like whatever the player wants it look like.\n\n\-     ""The Field"" - This is where the player finds themselves in as soon as they exit The Haven. This connects to all the other areas of the game, and is the largest among them. Enemies that are  encountered here will always weigh towards the player's current level. As the player's level increases, new enemies are introduced in this area.\n\n\-     ""The Desert"" - This is an example of an area with different terrain. Here, the world is more surreal. The enemies are much more aggressive, the player can experience mirages, and some locations are sinister in nature (cultist sites, a burned town, and a giant half-buried buried statue who follows the player by changing locations).\n\n\-     ""Trails"" - All of the areas in the world with different types of land will have these sub-areas that gradually changes in terrain. This is used to make the transition between areas feel more natural. Guards can be posted in some of the more urban places, who the player can either fight, pay, or accomplish a mission for them in order to pass.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEnemies (No specific ones yet):  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEnemies in the game can have multiple types, such as:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\- Steel  \n\n\- Earth \n\n\- Lightning \n\n\- Marble \n\n\- Sand \n\n\- Forest \n\n\- Dark (only 1 enemy) \n\n\- Light (only 1 enemy) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith types there are also weaknesses and strengths, like steel being weak to lava-based attacks but immune to electric based ones (and can also add electrical effects to their attacks). The dark and light types only belong to one enemy. These two are secret bosses that are the hardest in the game, and the player has to complete certain quests to find.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRandom Events:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\-     Illusions/Mirages:  These are the rarest random events in the game. They won't occur in every area of the game, with them only happening in The Field, The Desert, and others that I haven't thought of yet. In places like The Field, illusions are more docile. The player can have visions of a man and woman flying on a Pegasus , or children reciting a nursery rhyme before vanishing into dust. \n\nThe Desert, however, is much more sinister. The player will see visions of cactuses with faces staring at them, or a man made of fire violently rushing toward them. The man on fire could probably lead to a fake-out battle sequence, where is is so strong that he beats the player in a couple of hits, only to then find out they they never died, and whatever items they used are restored.\n\n\-     Animals:  As the player travels, they can come across an animal or multiple animals that they can hunt. Using the ""HUNT (TYPE OF ANIMAL)"" command, a mini-game will start. In this mini-game, a character that looks like this:  \\\_\_O (this represents a wolf), is presented at the top of the screen. At the bottom, there is a U (representing a bow) moving back and forth across the screen. The player has to press 1 (representing an arrow) as soon as it is lined up to shoot the animal. Missing it results in it running away. If the player have a gun, then they can skip this mini-game and kill the animal immediately, but not only is ammo limited, but some players might want to conserve their ammo for actual battles.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\-     Thieves:  Whenever the player sleeps in the game (explained in the next section), they run the risk of one or more thieves stealing their things as they wake up. The chances of this happening are very low. Thieves are always levels below the player, so they are easy to attack and kill. But when they are in a group, they are much more dangerous. The player has the choice to either attack, let them go, or try to talk them out of it. Attacking is self-explanatory. If they let them go, they will run off with whatever they have and will never be seen again. If the player decides to talk, then they will be given presets on what to say. All thieves behave differently. This affects the thieve's ability to back down. Some thieves may seem scared or unsure of what they're doing, while others are confident they can kill the player if they oppose them. While easy to kill one thief, taking on multiple can be a challenge. So sometimes it's best to let them go.\n\n\-     Merchants:  These people will occasionally ride up on horseback and offer something to the player. What they are selling at that moment is also random. The player can also ask them about the area they are in, and even some battle tips (an enemy's weakness for example).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMechanics:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\-     Sleeping: The player can only sleep in Havens that are found around the world. Sleeping is also the only way the player can bank their EXP.\n\n\-     Day/Night Cycle - In the game, there will be a clock that changes in real time. It slowly counts by fives. This can effect the descriptions of their environment. In daytime, the player will have a very detailed description that will tell them everything they need to know. At night, if they don't have some sort of light source, then the description of their environment will be limited by telling them the bare minimum. \n\nExamples:  \n\n(Day) - ""You walk out of the forested area and see a river. You notice strange rock covered in markings, with jagged carvings on the top of it. It seems as if it was once part of a trivial ceremony.""\n\n(Night) - ""You walk out of the forested area. Sounds of water can be heard.""\n\nThis can prevent the player from finding items or coming across certain locations that they would have seen otherwise. The enemy encounter rate is also higher when the player is in darkness. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese are things I typed everytime an idea came to me. I had to take some stuff out so this post wouldn't be too long. I am planning on doing this in Python, which I am still learning to use. Also, about the ""open world"" thing. These two types of games have always fascinated me. Text based adventure games are amazing because it forces you to visualize your entire surroundings . In open world games, you are given total freedom to traverse a massive world with so many things to do, like missions or simply sightseeing. I've seen other people attempt a text based open world, like Project GRIMDARK, but eventually give up on it. Insignificant Little Vermin is really close to what a text based open world would look like, but it's more like a Choose Your Own Adventure book. I want to see what a text based open world would look like in a more old-school way.\n\nSo I ask, does this sound like a fun game to play? Is there anything wrong with how certain elements are designed? Is there anything unnecessary? I obviously won't be able to start programming it until I keep practicing the language I'm using (Python), but I really want to see this project finished someday. With that being said, any criticisms are welcome.\n\nThanks :)"
g58niq,ideas for idle games?,"idle games are the thing right now and ive been thinking of making one but i dont have any ideas. ive worked with 2d and 3d games so theres no limitation in that field, just need a few good imaginative and creative ideas."
g57rhf,Stray - An extremely realistic and immersive zombie apocalypse survival RPG. (This is a long one too.),"Stray takes place in a an alternate future where a new disease ravages the world and mass panic occurs world-wide. (No relation to Corona, mind you.) From the west coast, to New York, to Europe and Asia and even Africa. As society itself began to break down, several major countries like Britain, China and even the U.S. are in a middle of a civil war. These new rebellions and ""independent"" Nations spark new and old ideologies, hoping to shield themselves from the mysterious new virus. \n\nThis new virus is only known as ""Sample 12-XE"". Originally found from combining 2 diseases that are currently unknown. The virus tears the person of their organs and kills them slowly in a painful process, while also putting pressure on the brain of the victim, effectively destroying its sanity and knowledge of reason.\n\nAfter all the suffering the world had gone through, The United States had finally developed a cure on October 26th, 2089. It was quickly revealed and (almost) everyone took the new vaccine. However, instead of curing the person, it made the problem ten times worse. Upon injecting the vaccine, it spreads the disease even faster and makes it much more potent and dangerous. Within 2 and a half hours of someone taking the vaccine, the person to be infected had turned into a diseased and decaying version of themselves, rendering them to become zombie-like. The  person infected loses all of their humanity and only knows to do one thing: Feed among the living.\n\n\nabout 1 year later, the world had fallen to Zombie-Kin and the fate of humanity and it's future looks grim. America and the rest of the world had kept on fighting until 2100. April 17th, 2100 was not a day of surrender. In fact, it was the day the Governments had left the soil that they originally inhabited Billions of years ago. Nobody know's where they went. It was anybody's guess as to where they had gone. But without the government to help, the problem only had gotten worse for the populous. Only about 2,000 living Humans are reported to be living within North America by 2105 and the only pockets of known human life lay in the Arctic Circle and the remnants of Michigan, in the Great Lakes Area. In Michigan alone, only had 2 settlements. These 2 settlements were called ""The Tunnels"" and ""The Refuge"". In the far North of the Arctic, the settlements were ""Site Alpha"" and ""Fort Doomhiem"".\n\n\nThe Tunnels are a settlement based in the old Subway tunnels of Michigan. They are currently the biggest settlement within the region but are currently suffering from over-population and are struggling to solve the problem. The Tunnels are currently lead by an Autocrat who is simply referred to as “The Visionary”. Despite having an awfully evil sounding background, the Tunnels care for the people and vow to protect them and meet their basic needs. The Tunnels also have the best Medical equipment and technology within the region.\n\nFort Atlas is specifically a strange one to many within the Great Lakes region. Originally, the fort was built during the zombie hordes invasion of North America, to be a part of the Alpha Line. The Alpha line is a group of defense covering the entry point into the eastern United States from the West. However, this line fell and now a bunch of religious folk occupy the fort. The Religious folk are, to put it simply, Raiders. They are super into the idea of a “Super America” and want to reunite the country. They are even so fanatic about the idea that they look for Abraham Lincoln and Gorge Washington for guidance and will kill or attack anyone just to get to their goal.\n\nThe Refuge is a trading focused settlement in the north. While being small in size, they are currently the richest out of any other settlement within Michigan. Lead in the way of a smaller version of the normal day Republic. However, they are rumors that The Refuge has been partaking in shady deals with some suspicious people. The Refuge, as the name suggests, is built on a Government owned Refugee camp.\n\nThe Canadian Military Remnants are the Remnants of the Canadian Military, after the Government’s of the world mysteriously vanished from the world. And some have been calling this event “The Great Adios”. However, nobody has ever seen or even made the attempt to go to them because of the climate of Canada at this point. But everyone is sure that they are the ones who know about why, how and where the governments are.\n\n\nThe game takes place in 2105, in Michigan and parts of southern Canada. I would say it’s an extremely hard game and very realistic (in terms of gameplay that is). It’s kind of modeled after Fallout in a way, but again, much more realistic and of the size of Red Dead Redemption 2. \n\n\nSo. What do you think?"
g57loy,Something like Splatoon,"I want to make a game and I really like splatoon, but I can't come up with any ideas."
g55z7o,A game idea that came to me in a dream - a cRPG about a medieval society exploring an advanced MegaCity based on the early 20th century,"Every now and then, I'll have some bizarre dream about a poem, or a song, or whatever, but usually forget them shortly after waking up. I am no Coleridge after all. Though perhaps this is my *Man from Porlock* moment.\n\n\nThe other night, I had a dream for a cRPG. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Premise:**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nYou play an explorer in to a technologically advanced, walled off city that sprawls the size of countries. The technology and architecture of the place is equivalent to early first world war; bolt action rifles, early tanks, etc. Elsewhere the world is still medieval. The city fell for some unknown reason and you are tasked with exploring it. The game has a dark, almost horror aesthetic. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHowever, the game opens in a vibrant tavern in a green meadow, both parodying medieval game tropes, and contrasting the countryside with the ""Victorian"" squalor of the ruined mega-city. It would be an isometric CRPG in the style of Fallout 2, or Disco Elysium.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Gameplay**\n\nEmphasis on exploration, survival, and dialogue; exploring the ruins of this city, its history and technology, its political ideologies; how it became so advanced and why it closed itself off from the world, as well as the personalities and lives of surviving citizens therein. Unlike cRPGs like Fallout 2, I think an emphasis on actually surviving would be good; sleeping, eating, yet not to the extent of the myriad tedious survival games of the present, like *We Happy Few* where one has to drink water every six seconds. \n\n**Style**\n\nVisually, the city is a mixture of the sloping *Mansard* rooftops of typical Parisian buildings; large boulevards for trams, and the imposing gothic architecture and stained glass windows of London, alongside heapings of industrial Manchester (think billowing factory chimneys and red-brick walls; hemmed in streets of sloping rooves, as if out of the film-adaptation of *A Taste of Honey* or classic *Coronation Street*. Industrial squalor against the grotesque wealth of those in power; yet all this technology, the tanks, the Brodie helmets and Renault tanks, alien to your medieval explorer. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAnyway, this was just from a dream I had. It'd probably be shite in reality."

g4wo8w,Georgia: The Land of Warriors,"In the 11th century, the small country of Georgia was under the control of the Arabians. Years passed and a Georgian King David the 4th had conquered half of his home country. Everything was going good but the capital city Tbilisi was still under the control of Arabians. The game starts with a boy (Main Protagonist) and his father (soldier) looking at Tbilisi from the woods on a hill, when the father sees Arabian patrol and orders the boy to hide in the woods. Father fights with the patrol but is captured.  Years pass the boy grew up, but never left those woods, he lived there and robbed travellers going through the forest.  \n   One day an old man is going through the woods and MP decides to rob him and jumps on him from the tree. The old guy blocks him and knocks him to the ground. The Guy reveals that he is MPs fathers old friend and knew that he would be here. He was sent by the Leader of an Organisation dedicated to destroying the Arabian Government system from the inside to free Tbilisi. The old Guy trains MP and they go to the underground cave base to get commands from the Leader about what to do.

g4uswy,Progressive open world apocalyptic survivor. Storyline and plot.,"*this is a spur of the moment idea I’m still trying to organize. Needed to get it down before I forgot any details, much more to come/fix) \n\n\nScene: this game would be based in a mid sized city. Tall buildings stand proud. Life fills the street. I’d take a peek at Saint John NB for reference (my hometown, where most inspiration would come from) You have the option to travel by foot, specific cars (IF the key can be found), bikes, or at the beginning of the game only, public bussing. You have an apartment to yourself where you live with your animal (choose between a cat or dog, both having minor different changes to the story as it progresses). Most buildings are free range late game. Where you can access the majority of apartments, buildings and houses (similar to real life) with their own unique styles. \n\nYou play as a young adult, moving to a new town to begin school the following month. Gender and look is optional, background is not. \n\nGameplay / story: You begin in your everyday life. Wake up. Do some minor tutorial based tasks around your simple apartment complex. Feed your pet, shower, feed yourself, etc. Once ready, you progress outside, where you’ll find your pedal bike. You begin to run some errands. \nPassing people living their everyday life, you see cars pass, the sun beaming down, etc. *here would be a good point to introduce some temporary background characters for emotion). You finish your tasks, return home where you have the option to forward to the game.\n\nA few days pass, you wake up once again in your apartment, and are quick to learn of small riots forming. Terrorism is peaking, and (insert fictional hometown here) is at its breaking point. You choosing to keep your distance and allow authorities to deal with the outcomes. You once again progress the game. \n\nThe following days, you witness minor glimpses of outside through your apartment window. Witnessing small amount of debris scattered amongst the ground as the riots continue. Citizens are being shot down, and clashes are happening in the streets. Fortunately you have food, and pet food. theirs no need to step outside for any reason. Just wait it out, and things will return to normal. You progress the game. \n\nYou awaken. Your bookshelf pushed up against your door for extra fortification and security. You begin your daily routine, gomplsing outside to see the ever so quickly crumbling economy. You have no choice. You must go out and scavage for good. You’re running out of options. The riots have died down. Gunshots can occasionally be heard in the distance. Sometimes the occasional scream. You kiss your pet goodbye, shove aside the bookshelf, and step into your hallway. \n\n***this is where the true gameplay would commence*** \n\n(Check the bottom for game mechanics and ideas regarding the world)\n\n\n* Items will be intractable. So that loose book you might see on the kitchen table will fall in correlation with the table being bumped.\n\n*the environment around you slowly changes day by day. Over the progression of the game, you’ll witness nature slowly overgrow the city. More rubble spears as buildings lack repair. More cars appear randomly (and permanently) as more off screen survivors run out of gas while traveling. You witness all of this progress more and more every day you move on. \n\n*physics on items, the player, npc’s, and bullet drop. \n\n*NO high end guns. In a realistic setting, most don’t have guns, and if they do, they typically consist of mid grade pistols, shotguns, and hunting rifles. Arsenals would consist of a large variety of clever craft able melee weapons, chemical based weapons (Molotov’s, rat poison, basically realistic things), and low grade guns apon finding them, or gaining them from an enemy. \n\n*houses, buildings, and apartment buildings can all be accessed, (with some obvious restrictions, would take up too much data to have EVERY unit in a city done), where you can explore unique apartment styles and models, unique furniture and clothing, etc. \n\n* A forgiving eating, sleeping, and mental health mechanic to balance your character and make changes to the progressive environment. Good mental health means better interactions with potentially violent people, or a potential stat boost. Where staying up for 2-3 nights will make your swinging less accurate, or maybe you run slower. Or maybe not eating leaves you with stomach pains, stunting your health by 25 points. \n\n*interactions with NPC’s will have an overall affect on your characters mental health and well-being. Killing an civilian can leave you depressed. Or helping, can leave you with a state boost. \n\n*NPC’s can be found in living places seeking cover. Every encounter would be different. You could enter a building and find a family, their hungry, but so are you. You make the decision. Rob them. Steal from them. Kill them. Bargain with them. Or leave them. In this scenario, maybe the father chooses to attack you, and you have to fight to survive. Maybe you lose, and have to restart from your first day out, or you win, and the story progresses. \n\n*No military apon late game exploration. Military officials are a consistent trump in games that take away from the creativity, in my biased opinion. \n\n*You have 1 shot, as this is a survival game. If you lose, you restart from day 1. The end goal is to survive as long as you can until your secure enough to live out the apocalypse, or find a way to a potential hidden rumoured-of safe zone."
g4ulwh,puzzle and platformer 1 or 2 survival game,"this should have a story and some fun mechanics and will take place in an almost abandoned empire which used to have a dictator before a plague swept most people out. it should have multiple good/bad endings and some secret endings (you can play with someone else (different maps for 2 player with not too much storyline) or play with a bot (storyline and more simple maps)\n\n a 3d game where you  have to do parkour (a bit like karlson by dani with all the same mechanics) but you have to find keys and codes you can carry but you have to avoid traps and hide in spots where someone chasing you doesnt see you. it could contain one big level with check points e.g: escape house into the town and find a way into the subway which you use to a city in which you get chased. or it could have chapters such as house ,city, metro, forest , hospital , school and end at the wall where you escape the empire. when you escape you can replay and find secret endings"
g4t82y,A horror game or a less horror game with a twist.,"In most of the horror games its always you and the bad guy, your friends and the bad guy and sometime you can be the bad guy.\nYou hide and run to prevent being caught. You decide your action which might or might not result in the death of your friends.\nWell what if there is a third person \nLike casper helping the protagonist of the story to survive,like taking control of things, first it starts from small things than with time and practice you can interact with various objects in the environments, and sometimes you can control the protagonist to avoid certain dangers or else you can push the protagonist towards the danger or the bad guy to kill him/her.\nOr if not a horror story then it could be somewhat like the Life is Strange series I will explain it with a story...\n\nYou wake up feelings groggy, with no mermories as you get accustomed to your surrounding.\nYou get the understanding that you are inside a room, you search the room for clues to understand who or where you are but to still you could not remember anything nor you have a phone or any kind of thing to identify your self.\nAs you were trying to figure out what was going on, you suddenly hear faint noises coming from the downstairs, you jump to action and you rush downstairs to talk to people. As you peek around the corner you see some people entering the house with some boxes. You rush to the doorway calling out to them for help but to your bewilderment they don't react, you start shouting at them asking them what is going on, when suddenly a guy with a box walks through you.\nYou feel more confused then ever but still you try to communicate with them. You try to touch them but your hands goes right through them no matter how hard you try, you just can't get their attention to you.\nFeeling defeated you sit down in a corner trying to contemplate what was happening....\nWhen suddenly you hear a small voice "" are you lost ?""\nThere is a kid standing infront of you, that kid can see you. You speak but child shaking his head and says he can't hear you...\nYou try to communicate through gestures but before you could do anything. His mother arrives and takes him upstairs, the kid try to explain there is a man sitting down in the corner.\nHis mothers looks your way, but she couldn't see anything but an empty corner, thinking that it was just a child imagination, the mother explains the child that its just his imagination.\nThe child looks again at the corner but this time he cannot see you.\n\nThis is where the story starts moving, you are ghost trying to find your past memories. \nAt the start You can interact with small objects and with time you can interact with almost anything.\nAnd the child is the key jn finding your memories.\nThere is a believe meter for each person you try to communicate.\nIf filled you can use it to interact with the person in a ethereal form but might freak them out.\nBut its different  for The child, he can see you even if your believe meter is almost empty but if it gets completely empty, the child will not be able to see you anymore you have to convince the child that you are real.\n\nThis story will be about you finding your lost memories and with that building a guardian like relationship with the child.\n\nThis is just an idea and I don't know if making this game is anywhere near possible but it would be good to create something new in the horror genre games.\n\nAny improvement in the above idea is welcomed."

g4o77d,Horror RPG based off an AU of WW2,"So imagine WW2, but the Japanese didn’t give up, even after the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. I’d like to make an RPG based in an underground test facility in japan, where they research the mutagenic properties of exposure to radiation and also the research of STEM cells, to attempt to create humans that can regenerate, and possible mutate into something stronger. The game would start about 10 years after the bomb of Nagasaki. The core mechanics of the game would be different types of puzzles and mini games depending on which character you’ve gotten into a fight with, and there would be a lot of decision making that can affect the ending. Relationships in this game would also be very important, as the game states “it’s not safe to be alone here” basically as soon as you enter. Relationships with characters can also affect endings. You’d also have to hide at certain points or do something in order to get away from an enemy, like button mashing. Please if you think anything could be added or changed I’d love to hear your criticism! The game has more too it but I don’t want to rant here! If you have any questions please ask away! Thank you for your time."
g4lvm3,Horror game idea,"This is a really simple idea any indie game developer can add as the idea is mostly dialogue.\n\n*game saves*\n\nScene: Mid-game/level, cutscene, if your horror monster has footsteps or breathing. Its heavy, right next to you. Your in hiding. Really tense music, or just really tense moment.\n\nYour character turns towards the camera, shows high emotional distress, slight sobbing. A quiet whisper at start, with a shaky voice. ""You.. need to turn the game off, (gradually getting more stern and louder. The noises around get more tense) Cut the power! CUT IT NOW! (Sobbing) I'm scared, \n(Optional)\nand... and if you won't do it. I will. (Mouse is taken over and goes through the menus and click to exit) (quick loading screen) There, we are good. Safe and sound. (Main menu) (the monster or so starts coming, see it in the background, main character gets captured by the legs and dragged off back into the area.) (A new mission pop ups saying to continue, you start to play as the camera itself to save the main character, which once found you become again.)"
g4lcl2,Zombie Survival Sandbox game from the perspective of multiple people.,"I've had this idea for a while. I've always liked the idea of playing a zombie survival game where you're experiencing the beginning of the outbreak from multiple perspectives. The levels would be very dynamic and destructible. \n\nFor example, the first level you'd be a retail worker and you'd be stocking shelves this would introduce you to the item manipulation mechanic. Think Half-Life 2 where you can pick up almost anything not nailed down. You'd be able to pick up and throw almost anything depending on weight. You cold also use almost anything as a weapon and they'd behave differently depending on their size and shape (i.e. you could pick up a shower curtain rod and swing it like a staff). You could also throw anything you can pick up, including guns) You could also drag or push heavier items. Anyway, as you're stocking, going through the tutorial, you start to hear small clues as to what's going on like maybe an intercom announcement asking for security. You could basically continue the tutorial or go investigate and it'd be someone who has just succumb to the zombie virus. Then everything pops off, zombies start coming in from outside while more customers and employees start to turn. You can close and lock the doors to slow down the influx, you can go to the sporting goods section and try to get into the locked gun case, etc. But your objective would be to survive for a specific amount of time, or escape to a specific area.\n\nOther level ideas could be: A businessman in an office on the 17th floor of a building, a construction worker on an active construction site, a theme park employee or guest at an active theme park. Then the later missions can be a bit more intense like being a soldier on a military base, or a sailor stuck on an aircraft carrier. \n\nI'd want all the levels to feel infinitely replayable. And very destructible. Like Digital Molecular Matter levels of destructible. You could barricade doors by dragging heavy objects in front of them, you could break through walls if you had a tool strong enough, all that jazz. \n\nCo-op would make it a lot of fun as well."

g4gbbm,Spider-Man full Vr game,"So I played the Spider-Man far from home VR experience and I felt it could have a lot of potential. The idea I had was a Spider-Man VR game which covered the events from Captain America: Civil War all the way up to Spider-Man far from home. You have to take the role of Spider-Man and keep your identity a secret while also fighting bad guys and crime, with side quests and main quests and like The Walking Dead Saints and Sinners, you can choose your own story. I feel like this could have a lot of potential if it wasn’t rushed and had the breathtaking graphics of Half life Alyx this could be a really good game"
g4ed7a,Opinions on this game idea.,"So, I've been working on a game idea lately, since I want to use the time in self-quarantine to improve on my game developing skills.  \nThe idea is about a top-down dungeon-like game about clearing dungeons and defeating bosses.  \nThe dungeon will have a total of 100 layers, which will be randomly generated in the form of grids.  \nIn fact, this idea is kind of inspired by SAO, if you've watched the series. As the player further descends/rises (depends on the game's style and story), the monsters the player has to fight against get stronger. Every 10 Levels, I'm planning to have the player fight against a boss, making up a total of 10 bosses.  \nThroughout the gameplay, the player can collect items such as swords, magic staffs, bows and such.  \nBy defeating enemies, the player earns so called ""skill points"" which he can use for e.g. improving his speed stat or damage stat.  \nThis game could potentially have a singleplayer, but a multiplayer mode as well, since the game's concept is ideal for a multiplayer mode.  \n\n\nPlease remember that this is just a raw game idea that came to my mind. I'm probably gonna change the whole idea and concept of this game or not even improve the idea at all because i'm not happy with the concept.  \n\n\nAnyways, I would really appreciate any sorts of feedback on this game idea, how I could improve it and if you would have fun with it, if it would be a well designed game with improved mechanics."
g4dezz,Scifi sandbox where you play as a cyborg Bounty Hunter. In space.,"Here's an idea I've been prototyping. I need your feedback and contributions. \n\nThe game can play out as a combination of TPS shooter Gameplay (Mass Effect/Uncharted) and exploration of an open ended environment set on different planets (maps) \n\nThe main character is a cyborg with detachable body parts. You can equip new body parts, augment them with mods or cyberweapons and even lose them in fights.\n\nNemesis system can be used beautifully here. It's unfair that this mechanic has only been replicated in AC:Odyssey (poorly, I might add). Pick a target, track them down and find creative ways to eliminate them. \n\nMaybe even have unlockable quests per bounty. Bounties have different grades with rewards. \n\nThat's all I've got for now"
g4cjwj,Asymmetric game rework?,"Am I the only one who feels asymmetric horror games are not scary but feels more like cat and mouse game? If you think the same, I have an idea for it.\n\nMy idea.\nLike most asymmetric horror games, there will be 4 human and one hunter. The twist here is the hunter is not a physical thing but a spirit that can possess objects. Objects include doors, windows, radio, robots, teddy bears, books, chairs, glasses, and etc. \n\nSummary\nThere is a blackout. Spirit can possess objects to scare players. Players have hand crank torch, that can light up to 10sec in game time and need to wait 15 sec to crank up again. Spirit is invisible in the dark, staying in the light stun it.  Survivor players will be scare when objects move, but will not be scare if they shine the light at spirit before possession take place.\n\nAsk me questions if you want to know more. How do you think of this idea?"
g4cdu8,Someone to bounce game ideas off?,"I'm an indie developer and have quite a few game ideas, however I find it really benifical talking about these ideas with people.. but all I hve is famil and a lot of times its just me hearing myself speak and coming up with ideas for the game. I'd love to chat with someone who has a spark for game ideas just to bounce ideas off, would be willing to pay.\n\nThe concern of posting the ideas on public forums like this is, is someone could steal them before I publish the game."
g48h4l,An interactive choice path game that revolves around 4 assassins trying to kill each other (single player),So there is 4 assassins tasked by the same person to kill one another and do it with the intention of being awarded 10 million dollars (the contractor is a VERY rich man). Each chapter you can only play as one of them but late in the game you can choose who you want to control and who you want to kill.\n\nI haven’t thought much of this but I did think of a cool last chapter sorta scene. If all of them survived and still want to kill each other then they all are told secretively by the contractor and where the others will be. Making it so they all go to the same spot.\n\nLater in the chapter they all coincidentally try to set up a sniper on the hotels cornering the street. And then see eachother on the windows or rooftops. in this scene only one can be victorious and get the 10 million dollar retirement money. \n\nThat’s just one example tho so don’t hurt me.

g446xz,A next-gen version of Battleship.,"While this classic pen-and-paper game can be fun on its own, my game idea is to make it even more fun by introducing some advanced weapons.\n\nWhen you start up this version of Battleship, you will be asked which war game you wish to play:\n\n* In the **Territorial Waters** mission, you receive one shot per turn.\n* In the **Target Plus One** mission, you receive one shot per turn, and if you land a hit you will be awarded a bonus shot, and so on until you miss.\n* In the \_\_\_\_\_ mission, you will receive one shot for each of your ships still afloat (so for instance if you have three ships afloat you receive three shots per turn).\n\nThere are also two options for deploying your fleet:\n\n* With a **custom fleet deployment**, you will be free to choose the position and rotation of your ships.\n* The game will also offer you around 60 or so **predetermined fleet deployments**.\n\nAnd there are two options for the type of weapons to use:\n\n* **Basic weapons** simulates the standard gameplay of Battleship.\n* **Advanced weapons** gives you many more options with which to take down the enemy fleet.\n\nIn this version of Battleship, your fleet consists of five ships: an aircraft carrier (five tiles long), a battleship (four tiles long), a cruiser (three tiles long), a submarine (three tiles long) and a special operations craft (two tiles long).\n\nNor for the advanced weapons. Of course, these can only be used in advanced weapons mode, and they are in limited supply, so make their shots count! Here are the advanced weapons:\n\n* The aircraft carrier can launch two attack squadrons to help destroy enemy vessels.\n* The battleship is equipped with one devastating Tomahawk Missile, which can devastate any ships in a one-tile radius of where it hits.\n* The cruiser can fire two Harpoon Missiles, which have two firing patterns, and devastate both the tile they hit and the neighbouring tiles in either the vertical or horizontal direction.\n* The submarine can use sonar to sweep for enemy vessels, and it can fire two torpedos from the edge of a row or column.\n* The special operations craft can fire anti-aircraft missiles to defend your fleet against the enemy attack squadrons."

fsn729,"Games where a timeline is instead a time loop, such as 3 seconds of time of a simple game object whose state 3 seconds ago and 3 seconds from now both equal it state now, as is displayed as, for example, 50 time steps per second, so 150 of it display at once like a rubberband smooth together","For example, imagine a racing game, or a circus where acrobatics are done, where a 3 second time range is displayed all at once and always fits smoothly together as the past and future end fit into eachother closing the loop. If its someone doing a flip then running back around to stand where they were before they did the flip, then that would be hard to bend into them doing 2 or 0 flips. Imagine a 4 dimensional rubberband, with each 3d cross-section being a moment in time and place as we normally experience it, and in 4d it always loops around, is a set of points, 150 times more of them than usual, where there is an energy function, depending on a sum of stretched too much or too little, between each adjacent pair of time steps, and you could somehow grab the 3 second long 4d manifold and bend it as it naturally will fall into lower energy states or resist more and more depending how and where you pull it. Imagine an artistic, acrobatic, andOr hardcore math number crunching puzzle-like, thing that happens as you bend and navigate this space of possibilities.\n\nAs a GPU programmer, I am a little concerned about the efficiency of trying a low exponential number of possible variations of current 4d manifold state and hill-climbing to next state based on that, but I expect, while maybe not the most mathematically perfect and smooth path through possibilities, something fun enough and low enough jumpyness could be found."
fsjqkd,simple platformer idea (preferably for mobile),"First off I want to start by saying this is an actual realistic game idea, I was actually making a prototype for this and it was coming off nicely, then Unity ruined my entire project with an update, but HEY, it's whatever.\n\nTo paint the idea in your head, basically it would be a platformer similar to Gravity Man, except you build the platform to reach the exit point, and there's no alien man chasing you. So basically it's a puzzle game combined with hand-eye coordination skills.\n\nHere's how a basic level would run; you have a 2D view of the whole map, your character on a small platform and everything else is empty space, and on the other end of the map there's an exit, you have a limited number of platforms you can place anywhere on the map to reach that exit, once you've placed your platforms you press the play button and the character will start running forward with the camera focused on the character, you can only jump, if you fall you go back to the 2D view of the whole map (the placement of your platforms is saved).\n\nI wish I had pictures from my prototype, that would probably give you a better idea of the game mechanics. I don't think there's any game out there quite like this, I could be wrong, if I am please tell me so.\n\nObviously this game needs a theme and more complex levels, and I do have all that, but I just want to keep this post simple. I might be willing to pay someone to make this a full-fledged game so let me know if anyone is interested, willing to work together as well."

And sorry if you can't understand what i want to explain.(sorry if it is also long for you to read, but trust me, this might be interesting to you)\n\nThis game has 2 chapters and some levels every chapter(it's up to you if how many levels you want in each chapter.)\n\n# STORY\n\n**Chapter 1**\n\nIntro: there is a powerful crystal that exists in their universe.  and the player was commanded by  a ""leader of their government"" to find that crystal. You go to your family to talk to your wife and son that he will go to a mission and promised to come back. the ""government leader"" said that they will send a backup.\n\nLevels:\n\n\-You face some men and they want to stop you from getting the crystal, so you fight  them, even the backups that the ""government leader"" mentioned didn't come to help you.  \n\n\n\-each level gets harder because the number of enemies multiply. \n\n\-after you got the crystal, a massive number of enemies and their leader came to get the crystal. you defeated all the enemies. \n\n\-the boss of the game is the leader of the enemies. you and the boss have the same skills and abilities. you almost defeated him but he cornered you and he takes off your mask. then he runs away. you tried to kill him but didn't caught him.\n\nEnding:\n\n you gave the bag that contains the crystal to the ""government leader"". The end(maybe its open ended but that's why there is a second chapter 2)\n\n**Chapter 2**\n\nthe chapters at connected, but not said directly in the game(maybe the game will just hint that they were connected)\n\n  \nIntro:\n\nYou were commanded by the government leader(not the same person from the chapter one) to find the crystal that was lost decades ago. they will send you to the past to get the crystal and hide to a safe place to get it to the present. (the devs may also insert that ""Your father died because of a mission"")  \n\n\n\-you send your back up team to go find the person that enemies sent to find the crystal while you face a ton of enemies. each level, the number of the enemies will multiply(here,the  player will realize that he is the leader of the enemies is himself, and he was the one who fought the person on the previous chapter. the player might also realize that the reason why there is no back up that came on the first chapter is because the leader of the enemies on the first chapter already defeated the backups before they could help you)  \n\n\-then you face the boss(which is the person from the last chapter). you almost defeated him but he manage to catch up and almost defeated you. while the time that you almost defeated him, you got the crystal from the his bag and hide it in your pocket without him noticing.  you manage to corner him, and take of his mask. You realize that he is your father, so you ran away and hide to a place so you could spy him.\n\n\-you saw him with the ""government leader"", and then your father gave it to the him(remember the ending from the last chapter). you saw the ""government leader"" became angry because he saw that the bag was empty and came back to his true identity, he was just diguising as the real government leader. You saw your father was shocked while he realize that he is working with the enemy of the society the whole time. then the ENEMY killed your father. He realize that he is the reason why his father died. so you jump in and fight the ENEMY. you defeated him.\n\nending:\n\nYou hide the crystal, go back to the present, get the crystal and give it to the government leader. you go to the grave of your dad and talk to him(even no one will reply), sad music, credits roll.\n\nNote:\n\nthe story may happen in any time/ era(can be medieval, futuristic, its up to you). and the names of the characters is all up to the devs.  \n\n\n# Controls\n\nthe controls can be based from the ""Minecraft: Storymode"" where you need to push some keys in able to attack and dodge and when the player didn't push a key, he will die and go back some seconds to try again. or it can be based form the other combat games(the first one might be easier to code).  \n\n\n# Time\n\nthe time that the devs might spend making this game:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|Dialouge(script)|2 to 3 days |\n|:-|:-|\n|character and the environment's design|1 day( this can be different, pixel art might be easy in this type of game|\n|Coding the whole thing|3-4 days(if its in 2d), a very long time(of its in 3d), or 30 min(if you just download some free presets on the internet)|\n|total|6-8 days(can be longer if you choose to do it in 3d)|\n\npls leave some feedback down the comments. and if you would do this game please give me some credits(just mention my username inside my game) and also give the link in the down below so i could also play it"
fs508l,"A third person Metroid game that combines movement, melee combat, and shooting.","The game features a third person viewpoint beat-'em-up style of combat which involves simple and complex combos, fleshed-out shooting mechanics, and a somewhat 'parkour' like style of movement.  \n\n\nThere is always emphasis on using all of these mechanics together. Some enemies will require a ranged attack to make vulnerable to melee damage, or vice versa, and combat arenas will usually be large, with enemies who are best fought by making use of the movement and the environment as well as shooting and melee attacking them. Furthermore, your gun is always available in melee, and close-range shots with it are a core part of your moveset. Opening up armor or shields with missiles or the Wave Beam, or freezing targets temporarily with the Ice beam, are attacks you will want to use frequently. You can even briefly use the Morph Ball for a quick evasion move, to stick bombs to opponents, or to deal large areas of effect with Super Bombs.\n\nNew movement mechanics like double and triple jumping and wall-running are now available, and many environments are built to give the player a sense of momentum while moving through them with the free-running style movement mechanics. Wall-runnable walls over pits of damaging liquid or high drops, a Spider Ball and areas that require Morph Ball movement, and even Shinesparking with the Speed Booster(which is now a limited-meter instant-activate ability that also gives you a quick, powerful shoulder-bash ability in melee combat) all make combat an engaging experience, and as you play, your new abilities will open shortcuts or otherwise trivialize areas you've been through, making it no longer a pain to backtrack."
fs41ov,Community Content Focused FPS?,"If its isnt already a thing, I can imagine an fps with powerful creation tools to add custom weapons, modes, and player clothing/armor. \n\nThe twist is that it can be sent up to the servers, which will determine what can be done to balance the weapon/item, as well as put it into the common library.\n\nSo you can make something truly custom and show it off without other players having to download the same mods, it would all be integrated serverside. \n\nIt might be unrealistic, I just figured Id toss this idea in here to see what happens. Looking forward to what you all think!"

I'd like feedback on this idea to kind of flesh it out a bit..."
frvkeu,An Open World Motorcycle Gang Game,"I know this sounds like another version of the GTA Lost and the Damned dlc, but I had other ideas in mind. \n\nThe game would be a open world concept set in a fictional version of Kentucky (or any other southern style state in the USA). You play the roll as an undercover agent infiltrating one of the biggest motorcycle gangs in the city (think similar to the Outlaws or Hell's Angels). Someone was apprehended who tipped the police off that they were working on something big, which prompted to send your main character in as a ""prospect"", which is a newbie who wants to get into the gang but must prove him or herself. The city itself has other gangs and mobs that have uneasy relations with the gang you're in, but things will get inflamed as the story progresses. \n\nThe game mechanics are quite simple, just your standard third person action game, however being a motorcycle gang in a large city has its' challenges, which leads to one of the core mechanics of the game; pay offs. As a prospect, your job is to run your way up the ranks, but in the meantime you have to run odd jobs to pay off certain city groups, members, departments. All of these pay offs have benefits not only to you, but to your gang as a whole. For example:\n\n\-Pay offs to medical doctors/pharmacists. This way if you die, you can respawn back with more health, cost less money (like respawning in GTA), and even benefit your gang as a whole if you get into group fire fights. \n\n\-Pay offs to police. If you engage in a firefight, police response will take longer, and even if you engage in a police chase, pursuits will take less time the more $$ you pay them. \n\n\-Gun stores. You can get bonus ammo, bonus armor and bulletproof vests, and even special guns. \n\nIn the missions you run, you get $$ and that money you control how its' spent. You can keep most of it yourself and invest in your clothes/gear/motorcycles/etc. or you can pay more to the pay offs, which is its' own way of leveling up in the game. You decide. \n\nSide missions have you running into all sorts of personality types in the city; local motovloggers, celebrities, moto-madness riding groups, food trucks, breweries, etc. You obtain missions through your smart phone (via texts, messages, and phone call voice mails). Your main hub is your smart phone. \n\nThanks for hearing me out on this! I'm currently writing more of this with hopes of starting to develop this on my own with Unreal 3. I know it's quite an ambitious game to develop by myself, but most of this is a pipe dream thing. Depending on how this quarantine shit lasts, I may have the time."

frsatw,Asymmetrical family party game,"\nAssuming that everyone knows asymmetrical game such as Hogwash, Dead by Daylight, Last Year: The Nightmare, and Evolve, I will continue to only explain the different mechanics. If you have questions, you can write it in comment or dm me. \n\n**Environment:**\n\ncan take place in a living room, playground, garden or supermarket. Children will have tasks to perform tasks to rampage the environment and the parent will have to prevent them as well as clean the mess. Parent can prevent them by giving them time-consuming tasks, reading them bedtime stories, and etc. \n\n**Concept**\n\nUnlike DBD, children cannot be eliminated from the game. The game will be time limited, if half the environment is a mess children wins. To make the whole play-through fair, the parent can use gadgets like music box, dunce hat, toys to ""freeze"" children for a short period. \n\n**Style** \n\nasymmetric so parent will have first person and children will have third person view. Art and design is similar to Who's your Daddy and Granny Simulator.\n\n**Level**\n\ndivided into easy, medium and hard for both characters. For parent: easy= 2 children, medium= 3 children and hard= 4 children. For children it will be the opposite. If you want you can also put a progression system. \n\n**Mods**\n\nThere will be new maps. Power up for children to run faster, jump higher, perform task faster. New themes like medieval style, Egyptian style, Space style, robot style, stone age style and many more. Freeze mods where children have to remain still when parent is around."

That old childhood debate: ""my dad could totally beat up your dad.""","This game would mimic Pokémon style exploration, battles, and tournaments, except that every child (players/NPCs) only has one ""monster"" -- their dad.\n\nInstead of exploring forests, you'd explore your local public park. Instead of exploring jungles, you'd explore city blocks of the concrete jungle -- during a visit downtown. Other areas might include: an art museum, a zoo, a carnival, a theme park, a beach, etc. You get the point. These areas would appear to be vast like the Pokémon regions because they're being viewed from a kid's perspective.\n\nInstead of having multiple dads with different abilities, you would level up your singular dad with new abilities, attacks, stat upgrades, and cosmetic accessories (sunglasses, baseball cap, etc). Maybe there are classes of dads to pick from at the beginning of the game that determine your initial build.\n\nP.s. the concept for this game was directly inspired by u/coreyredditdraw OC on r/characterdrawing.

Certain events take more time than others. Example: You start off the game with 4 time slots.

The mini collectibles are optional help add to the total of the funds to your end goal.\n* The locked doors are located in this area in the overworld which is this massive junkyard dungeon that holds all future trinkets and other things you can pawn off to sell.\n* You can also do trades with residents within the ""trinket"" world and get items to pawn off in your antique store\n* In the town you help your protagonists uncle run an antique shop and try to pawn off as much as you can. You can haggle, negotiate, and lie about the price of your items to increase its value. Results may very.\n* The worlds in the ""trinkets"" can also be explored in a 3d space to ask for quests and take in the world.

frhjol,"Dance Central, but create full original routines with any song","What is Dance Central? Just Dance, but better.\n\nHarmonix hasn't made a good Dance Central game since DC3, and that was the best title out of the entire series. Dance Central was the best use of Xbox's Kinect at the time.\n\nI'm no developer and I don't know exactly how this stuff works, this is just an idea that could possibly work in the future with better technologies, and I don't think it's too far off from reality. I don't know the ins and outs of the Kinect, motion capture, or basic animation, but let's hypothetically assume that something like the Kinect is, or could be, powerful enough to do what my idea asks of.\n\nDC3 has a 'Make Your Move"" feature, and it's great for the time it came out in, but it didn't actually *apply* the players moves to the actual in-game characters. It was also really basic and used preexisting music from the game. It only played back video it captured of the players dancing and looped it. My idea is to let the player fully flesh out original choreography to any song they choose. You would have full control over naming the individual moves, difficulty, the song you want, and sharing it with others. It would perfectly catch the movements of your body and you could tweak it in game with a little bit of practice. You could apply the dance to any in-game characters."

frg4b8,A Fantasy game with a large crafting system and complex magic system,"I find myself constantly pining for a fantasy game that allows me freedom within the game's world when it comes to crafting and magic. I'm finding games that have magic systems nowadays rather dull and unoriginal.\n\n**Magic System**\n\nIn most fantasy games that have magic there's no actual magic just powers to equip and spam, maybe combine for more effects.\n\nI'd like a system where I have to do research and then create my spells. have different core types for the spells like attack, defence, utility. Then modifiers for target types, elemental types, duration and so on. As to allow players a complex arsenal of self-made spells that fully fit their own gameplay style. Make it so magic isn't just for combat but can be used as much as possible as true magic would. I want to see spells for travelling, custom magic traps and triggers, location and detection, daily use.\n\n**Crafting System**\n\nAnd then there are the very limited crafting systems the items made are very limited in use. some items are treated as consumables when in reality they aren't. For example, potions are made up of their container and the consumable potion contents. why can't I keep the bottle?\n\nI want to a crafting system where items are made up of their multiple components. So a potion is the bottle and contents. a system where I can make anything within the reason of the available materials. something along the lines of a restricted 3d modelling mechanic with simplified tools and minor ai help for solid objects, a combination system to synthesize new materials including gases and liquids.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I understand that a game with these level of mechanics would take years, decades even to design and implement. But it would have so much freedom of choice I feel that not only would it be worth it but would draw in a large fanbase not only during creation but afterwards for years to come as well."

Different types of delivery goods you could deliver is, cars, machinery, different types of food(frozen and imported, different sorts of animals, an abundance of delicates, many types of drugs, different kinds of furniture, nuclear, all kinds of materials and even road construction stuff. You also need to deliver materials for construction of roads so you can get to towns or certain places you can't just drive to. I really liked how Death Stranding was setup. It got a little repetitive tho. I would love to do the same kind of thing but with the similar vehicles we have today. Such as Cars, Half-tons with and without trailers, big rigs with and without trailers, Vans, and any other types out there. Use a leveling system where you can only deliver little things at the start and make your way up to delivering tons and tons of equipment and materials. You also earn money to upgrade living quarters and customize vehicles. Almost like a delivery survival game I guess. All the toys can come later like 4x4 trucks, 4 wheelers, bigger houses, garages and such and even clothing and character customization. Let me hear if anyone else is thinking of games like these."

First off the big guys (kings,nobleman,lords) are powerful NPC. \nThe players can challenge the NPC for their spot and gain the power that the function has over the people that serve under it and the territory if it's the case.\nFor example , if a player beats a lord of a province in x kingdom , then he controls the territory and can establish new rules. However, if he streches too far, the king might see this as a danger to him or the country or if the rules established by the player are contradicting with the philosophy of the country , then it would yield the same result( king would stomp him or something like that).\nThe players would be able to reform the territory if they have the power and numbers and could chance the way to get the power. \nIt would be a madness. \nI am not too good at putting in words everything that I am thinking but think a game where players take the wheel and can either be normal adventurers or rule over the others like they would in a game like Europa universalis or crusader kings but as a actual player in the game not a higher being that controlls the rullers."

But the energy is not an icon in the HUD but is rather a circular progress bar around the player, which serves also as shield. So when you shoot/move you consume energy and reduce the size of the shield, leaving you more exposed.\n\n* When an enemy shoots you in the energy/shield, you are protected. When they hit you, energy gets reduced.\n\n* If energy reaches zero, you die.\n\n* When you kill an enemy, you earn energy.\n\n* The closer to your character that you aim, the softer your shot. The farther away the aim, the more damage the shot deals, the more you move and the more energy you consume.\n\n\nThe idea of a mechanic doing multiple things seemed a good idea.

fr3vem,Groundhog Day in Ancient Pompeii (game idea),"You are a citizen of the ancient Roman city of Pompeii. You wake up on October 23rd A.D 79 from a terrible dream of fire and ash, a premonition of impending doom. You have one day to warn the townspeople and get them to safety before Mount Vesuvius erupts. \n\nThe day is spent wandering around the open-world streets and squares of the city, into tabernae, public baths, aristocratic houses, markets, the theatre, the gladiators gym and more. You try (or not) to convince friends, family, lovers, famous citizens or even random strangers that the end is nigh. \n\nThough most dismiss you as a madman, your interactions with people have strange and unpredictable consequences for how their final day is spent.\n\nYou can play Cupid for some star-crossed lovers, murder rivals, throw a wild bacchanalian party, participate in political intrigue, induce mass hysteria, impersonate religious leaders, seduce your hot neighbour, steal priceless treasure, carve cryptic or slanderous graffiti around town, ensure the survival of some characters while erasing others forever or simply fill the temple of Venus with hundreds of cheese wheels. \n\nFinally the volcano erupts blanketing the whole town in a thick, preservative dust. The screen goes black.....scratch, scratch, swish, swish. It’s the sound of an archaeologists brush, meticulously uncovering the city and people of Pompeii, frozen in time. \n\nKey characters fates are revealed as the archaeologists notes scrawled across the screen detail who was found where, doing what, with whom. The archaeologists make assumptions about Roman culture and society based on the evidence you leave behind (cheese wheels a sacred symbol of love and beauty?) Survivors of the eruption may go on to have far reaching influence on world events. History becomes the epilogue to your Groundhog Day in Ancient Pompeii. \n\nSuddenly a rooster crows, and you wake up with a start. You’re back in your bed in Pompeii on the 23rd of October, 79 A.D. Maybe this time you’ll figure out how to save the whole town."

Setting in the title, but there's a lot of possibility here really. Frontier colony, special police / agent unit, insurgents...\n\nNo or very indirect player-involvement in battle, the whole gameplay loop should be about picking recruits, designing different training plans and building facilities to accomodate everyone's needs and then assigning soldiers/squads to a task depending on setting (Contracts, raiding, scavenging, guard duty.... here will be skill checks, random events, enemies).\n\nI'm thinking a high diversity of skills would be fun, with every recruit having different skill potential caps. This would mean that the player could throw together different training schedules geared towards different potentials in recruits; ""You are bad at shooting but could be a good medic, after the basic plan you train as a combat medic"", ""You have potential for accuracy, you'll train as a sniper"", ""You have potential as a leader, here's a promotion and additional lessons in commanding"", ""You can do everything! You'll get a promotion, a raise and non-stop cruel training"".\n\nThe skills of a whole squad would be checked together, now add in unit cohesion and morale that enhances or depresses total skill value.\n\nOn a more personal note, I have an itch for a game like that for a while now and nothing quite scratches it.

It could also have battles of bandit raids, but this should not be part of the main gameplay.\n\n Currently, the struggle is to create a simple building mechanic. It could have some puzzle or rts elements. Any ideas for a village building mechanic?\n\nThanks!"

fqywp3,An FPS with throwing knives instead of guns.,"So I’ve been thinking to myself recently and thought, “FPS games have only featured guns as a primary weapon. Why don’t we switch it up?”\n\nPlayers play in Team Deathmatch wielding knives instead of guns. Players must throw these knives at each other to deal damage. There are many different types of knives, each with their own weight (affecting how fast they fall when thrown) as well as a unique perk to them. Players have a maximum of 3 knives (up for debate) and they must gain more knives from ammo boxes littered around the area. Players must also use health packs around the map to regain health. Think Team Fortress 2 but everyone uses the Flying Guillotine.\n\nCURRENT KNIFE IDEAS:\n\n-Starter kitchen knife that can ricochet off walls\n\n-Swiss Army knife that allows you to gain more knives from ammo boxes, and you can hold more of them\n\n-Butcher knife that OHKs to the head but flies slower\n\n-Kunai that flies unusually fast\n\n-Butterfly knife that can OHK when hitting the back of a player (reference to TF2, effect is up for debate though)\n\n-Melee sword because it still technically counts as a knife\n\n-Tactical knife that functions the same as the kitchen knife (reference to CSGO, secret skin unlocked by an achievement, equipped with the spectrum skin)\n\n-Tomahawk that functions the same as the butcher knife (secret skin unlocked by an achievement, will probably not make it into the final game due to hitbox problems)\n\n-Shuriken that functions the same as the Kunai (secret skin unlocked by achievement)\n\nAny comments suggesting more knife ideas as well as ways to improve upon the concept will greatly be appreciated."
fqyqa2,3D Platformer/Life Sim more details,"* It's visual style is inspired by early low poly N64 more specifically Animal Crossing \n* The overworld would take the animal crossing world scrolling approach.\n* The 3D platformer worlds would be accessed by gateway items labeled as ""trinkets"" which allows the player to enter worlds based off that item. The ""trinkets"" are just everyday objects ex. clock, cutterly, books. \n* The worlds in the trinkets and the overworld would coexist through you as you get items from both worlds to reach your end goal, being to save enough cash to leave your place of residence."
fqxyz4,Possessed by Combat (Turn-based FPS),"A turn-based strategy game, where you are able to dictate the locations and status of two or more platoons. Against another player whom also does the same. The players could possess any soldier at any location with any status. You and they have the choice then, to take possession of different soldiers, while possessing them increases the likely-hood of winning that skirmish. Can choose to battle 1v1, 2v2, etc. Also the odds of winning by not possessing any squads are tremendously low. Since automated squads are not necessarily smart, think call of duty during firefights in campaign mode on normal. Win skirmishes in order to gain more ground to surround the enemy. Either beat them to surrendering, or annihilation. Similar to SC2, and Call of Duty. Only instead of as a RTS, it is a turn-based. Also, as many enemies that are within the field of view, outside the fog of war. From paying attention, you can tell which soldiers are being possessed by the opponent. What do you guys think of this one?"

fqr7x9,Desolated Isolation (Game Idea),"An RPG game, set in a open world, where you are the last remaining human in existence. There are only animals, plants, and the constructs left behind by humanity's disappearance.\n\nThere is a time-span to world destruction. Nuclear power-plants and the like have been left to its own devices and are bound to self-destruct. And if averted, you still have to survive. \n\nDeath is game-over, you go into the game with a set amount of experience, skills and knowledge. You can also gain skills, experience, and knowledge. But if you don't keep up with your memory, everything will fall apart. Hence, the sanity meter. It'll keep track of your mind-frame. At the end of the game, is statistical analysis of your choices, which the sanity meter keeps track of. Which is from the frame to true happiness, to swift madness. To lean more toward one side than the other, is death. Game-over. \n\nThe goal of the game, is to see how long you can survive, doing whatever it is you can to keep self intact. You receive the ability to attribute values to objects in the open world, or subjects upon meditation. Experience increases skill. The upward momentum of the sanity meter, will keep your memory intact. Lean too far into the positive side of the sanity meter though. Game-over. \n\nBut you also have to look out for physical safety. Cooking fresh meat produces health, too much of it increases weight. Likewise all manner of foods, or even the lack thereof, changes your overall survivability percentile. Purity of water matters as well. \n\nEvery attribute you give to an object, dependent on its relation to other objects, will either increase or decrease the probability of finding it. \n\nThis game teaches, practical moralities and philosophies. And thus, asks the question overall: How would you fair in a world if the rest of humanity disappeared?"
fqpnkb,Ballistics based home invasion simulator.,"Ok so we have all played as a bad ass special forces operator or a Kevlar clad SWAT hero however in this game you will assume the role of a lowly civilian facing the horrifying split second decisions of a brutal home invasion.\n\nThe basic premise of the game is a single civilian (ft family members as NPCs) faces off against up to three armed attackers trying to break into his home.\n\nThis would be an FPS game heavily based in reality in regards to physics, movement and especially ballistics and injuries (think Escape from Tarkov) and the weapons would be limited to those available to those available on the civilian market (so mainly semi auto, taser and even melee such as bats/blades)\n\nEnemies would be proceduraly generated (with various loadouts) to encourage suprise and replayability and your character as you attempted to prevent the intruders from hurting you or your family.\n\nEnemies would use tactics and team work to try and either steal a valuable item from your home or eliminate your household there would only be a maximum of three burglars and landing shots would be difficult due to limited training, possible suppresion and of course adrenaline!\n\nUpon either succesfully eliminating the invaders or getting killed (most likely given the odds) you would be presented with an after action report and this is what truly sets this game apart... \n\nThe debriefing would include a detailed ballistics report (think, Hunter: The Call of The Wild) where by you are shown where each of your bullets fired ended up.  So whether you got a 9mm headshot that instantly ended your attacker or a .45 nasty groin shot leading to a bleed out it would all be presented in a faux forensic report (sort of an X-ray) detailing injuries and any collateral damage sustained.\n\nCould also be a great VR title and possibly assemetrical multiplayer (this would be difficult to balance given the required level of realism)"
fqotnx,Asymmetrical family humor party game where the hunter is the parent and the survivors are the children,"Assuming that everyone knows asymmetrical game such as Hogwash, Dead by Daylight, Last Year: The Nightmare, and Evolve, I will continue to only explain the different mechanics. If you have questions, you can write it in comment or dm me. \n\n**Environment:**\n\ncan take place in a living room, playground, garden or supermarket. Children will have tasks to perform tasks to rampage the environment and the parent will have to prevent them as well as clean the mess. Parent can prevent them by giving them time-consuming tasks, reading them bedtime stories, and etc. \n\n**Concept**\n\nUnlike DBD, children cannot be eliminated from the game. The game will be time limited, if half the environment is a mess children wins. To make the whole play-through fair, the parent can use gadgets like music box, dunce hat, toys to ""freeze"" children for a short period. \n\n**Style** \n\nasymmetric so parent will have first person and children will have third person view. Art and design is similar to Who's your Daddy and Granny Simulator.\n\n**Level**\n\ndivided into easy, medium and hard for both characters. For parent: easy= 2 children, medium= 3 children and hard= 4 children. For children it will be the opposite. If you want you can also put a progression system. \n\n**Mods**\n\nThere will be new maps. Power up for children to run faster, jump higher, perform task faster. New themes like medieval style, Egyptian style, Space style, robot style, stone age style and many more. Freeze mods where children have to remain still when parent is around."

fql02j,Ideas for a Sonic game.,"Title: Sonic and the Hedgehogs\n\n==========================================\n\nBackstory and Lore:\n\nIn a world where animals have evolved into anthropomorphic beings that live in harmony with one another, an enterprising roboticist discovers the secret to their peaceful existence : the abundant floating rings of life protection.\n\nThese animals have all learned to collect these large rings in order to protect themselves from the dangers they face everyday. As long as they have at least one ring, it will protect them from any harm. \n\nHowever, many animals still struggle to hold onto their rings and often drop and break them whenever they suffer any unfortunate attack. It is for this reason the younger, and more vulnerable animals seek out more rings to hold onto.\n\nBefore the first rings of life protection were discovered, animals were only able to survive for as long as they could because they procreated enough strong offspring. Now, these rings have allowed animals these to learn and grow into their very distinct anthropomorphized selves.\n\nAlso, animals who attempted to procreate while wearing these rings found themselves producing rings instead of offspring. It is for this reason why the number of rings quickly  grew at an exponential rate.\n\nDue to the contraceptive properties of these rings, only animals who were willing to procreate without wearing the life protection rings were able to produce their much stronger offspring. Not only that, younger animals who weren't ready to produce their own offspring could instead procreate more rings with other ring bearing animals.\n\nSoon enough when these animals began to specialise in delivering goods and services they weren't able to before, these rings were adopted as a currency given they were valued by all the animals and so could be traded with. However to ensure they maintained their value, legislation was passed to regulate the number and quality of new rings being procreated every day. Now, dropped rings would no longer break upon impact but animals who produced rings too frequently had to discard them in places where they would difficult to find. It is for this reason that so many of these rings can be found almost anywhere.\n\n==========================================\n\nStory:\n\nOf course, no amount of legislation was going stop Sonic, an especially fast and rebellious hedgehog, from collecting enough rings to help produce his fire mixtape.\n\nLittle does he know, the enterprising Dr Robotnik has already gathered enough rings to design, manufacture and offer a variety of robots to vulnerable animals throughout the world. For only one ring, any animal could choose to live a quiet life, safe and secure within these indestructible robots.\n\nHowever, once enough of the animals had become dependent on their metal exterior and each robot had a reliable source of energy, Dr Robotnik was now able to take control of his badniks. \n\nBy the time Sonic had returned home with his newfound rings, it was already too late. All of his friends had been roboticised either by choice or by force and were forever trapped inside indestructible badniks, each programmed to seek out rings or ring bearing animals. If Sonic was going to stop the expansion of Dr Robotniks empire, he would have to find a way to destroy every single badnik and free all the animals. \n\nLuckily, the abundant floating rings of life protection possessed another peculiar property that not even the most enterprising Dr Robotnik was aware of. Sonic soon discovered that with enough momentum, he could destroy anything in his path while holding onto a ring.\n\n==========================================\n\nControls:\n\nL-Stick : Move\nR-Stick : Look\n\nRT : Run\nLT : Roll\n\nA : Spinjump\nX : Dash/Air Dash (mid-air)\nB : Spinkick/Flying Spinkick (mid-air)\nY : Special Actions and Tricks\n\nLT + A : Charge Spinjump\nLT + X : Charge Spindash/Charge Air dash (mid-air)\nLT + B : Drift \nLT + Y : Bounce\n\n==========================================\n\nGame Mechanics:\n\nRT will accelerate Sonic forwards and raise his speed cap at the cost of a larger turning circle. \n\nCollecting more rings can further raise his speed cap and going faster will also slightly increase the range rings can be collected from.However, the faster Sonic goes before crashing, the more damage he will take and so, the more rings he will drop.\n\nIf a struggling player continues to frequently take damage, Sonic will slowly improve at dropping less rings upon impact. However, if a much skilled player is able to avoid taking any damage, Sonic will instead drop more rings on the rare occasion he receives damage. \n\nIf Sonic takes damage without holding any rings, he will be knocked out and later wake up wherever he is taken to. The more damage taken when he is knocked out, the longer it will take for Sonic to recover.\n\nIf an ally is nearby, you can take control of them and try to revive sonic before he is captured by any of his enemies. Otherwise, Sonic will need to escape from wherever his enemies take him when he wakes up.\n\nSonic can collect rings that have been discarded throughout his world or attack others to make them drop their rings. The more damage he inflicts on his foes with his speed, the more rings they will drop. Some enemies will flee from Sonic, others may chase him if they are much bigger than he. Regardless of size, the faster a foe, the more rings they'll have. Of course, this means the faster Sonic goes, the more foes he will attract.\n\nPerforming a variety of impressive stunts consequetively while maintaining your momentum without taking damage will build up a style meter. \n\nStunts include air tricks, wall running, wall jumping, near misses, and also spinkicks, flying Spinkicks and airdashes against foes.\n\nAir Dashing into or Fly Kicking a foe will also launch Sonic up into the air and allow him to either: jump or charge jump off the foe; perform another air dash or charged air dash or perform another flying spinkick or charged fly kick.\n\nOnce the style meter has filled, Sonic becomes an unstoppable force able to damage anything he Rolls into as long as he continues to maintain his momentum.\n\n==========================================\n\nPrimary Gameplay Loop: \n\nCollect Rings to go faster; \n\nBuild and maintain both momentum and style by avoiding hazards and performing tricks at top speed;\n\nDestroy small badniks with speed and style; \n\nEvade indestructible bosses that will give chase; \n\nSpend Rings on items and upgrades to use against bosses; \n\nDestroy a boss and free one of Sonic's friends; \n\nFind another area with more badniks and bosses to destroy; \n\nRinse and repeat until all of Sonic's friends are free and Dr Robotnik is no more."
fqg9k1,One piece mansion remake,"I think a remake or reimagining of an old ps1 game, ""One Piece Mansion"", would be sweet! \n\nFor those that don't know of it or haven't ever heard of it, here's a simple breakdown. You play an apartment manager of sorts that is responsible for keeping your tenants happy. Each tenant (cube/room/square) has, directional influence? Some give positive vibes to adjacent tenants others are negative. The tenants all vary what they influence and how. You have a set distance out and can go up depending on game mode. I really enjoyed this game and would love to see some sort of revamp or update to mobile or system!"
fqg4uw,Some FPS tied ideas I'd love to make or see,1. A Hero is a marine in 2027 who attacked his corporal because he would not kill innocents so he is sent to a Base in the outer Solar System on Titan and a couple years go by when the groups medaling with messing with the fabric of the Universe opens up in to a Dimension filled with creatures that act and sorta look like Demons but the universe not so much like hell more like a Parallel Dimension vavaged by a disease that turns all the into thy Demon monsters\n\n2. A Group of hero's immune to a deadly virus that make anything infected into horrifying terrifying Monsters one could only imagine came from the depths of hell\n\n3. I am just out of ideas you guys decide what
fq9d2a,A horror game starring giant insects,"I have this idea about a spiritual successor to ''Dead Space'' starring giant insects. Since insects can survive getting their limbs and heads removed, I thought that the dead space style of combat would be perfect.\n\nStory  \nIn a post-apocalyptic world where giant insects suddenly appeared, humanity is on the verge of extinction. You are tasked with going to a hospital to find medical supplies. You are attacked by a large swarm of mosquitoes, and are forced to barricade yourself in a hospital. There is a hazmat suit hidden in the hospital, and you have to find it if you want to pass through the massive swarm of disease carrying mosquitoes which are desperate for their next meal. Armed with only a gas mask and some guns, can you survive?\n\nMechanics\n\n* Shooting enemies limbs to defeat them. Perhaps some enemies can fly and you have to break their wings. Some enemies may have powerful exoskeletons, others may be soft a squishy. \n* The game would take place in a single hospital. Outside, massive swarms of mosquitoes are roaming. Going out of the building would result the player character getting killed by the swarm. Even if you survive the encounter, it doesn't matter because they would give you malaria. This would also limit the games scope considerably.\n* Since the game takes place in a hospital it could explain why there are healing items present. \n* Main enemies are insects, so them utilizing a wide range of poisons and diseases could also tie into the games hospital setting. Using antivenom and such.\n* Killer fungus has taken over certain areas. Thankfully you brought your trusty gas mask with you! You only have a limited time to escape such areas, before running out of oxygen and getting overwhelmed by fungal spores. These areas are somewhat similar to anti-gravity portions of dead space, in that your time is limited.\n* Brutal death cutscenes.\n\nCharacters\n\n* Similarly to Leon from resident evil series, I feel like the main character should have a silly haircut. I propose a large afro. :)\n* Giant mantises- The most common enemy. They behave similarly to slashers from dead space.\n* [Horsehair worms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nematomorpha)\- Parasites which occasionally pop out of deceased mantises. They try to choke you.\n* Giant spiders- a genre staple . They use their powerful toxins to subdue you. There could also be many different varieties\n\n1. A daddy long legs- Insanely fast, but fragile\n2. Tarantula- Slow, but can take a beating, can also release poisonous hairs at the player.\n3. A web making spider- tries to ambush you in a web.\n\n* Giant centipedes- How can you cut the legs off an enemy with so many legs?\n* Botflies- Try to inject you with their eggs. Thankfully they are weak.\n* Parasitoid wasps- Essentially the same as the botflies, but far more aggressive.\n* Giant worms- cutting them in half just creates more worms for you to deal with.\n* Leeches- try to suck your blood. Can actually be beneficial by removing status effects.\n* Ants- cat-sized ants that attack in massive swarms. They are similar to swarmers from dead space.\n* Giant dragonflies- The ultimate predators. Fast, powerful and ruthless, the only weakness is their fragile wings.\n* Mosquito swarms- Unlike the other enemies, these mosquitoes stayed small. They are an insta kill if you leave the hospital.\n\nWhat do you think? If you have any problems with the ideas, please tell me. I hope you enjoy. :)"

fpq9gy,Space Top Down Shooter (Semi-Open World)," btw Not my first time posting this\n\nSo here is my idea for a game I want it to be a open world RPG with a top down view. Like that of fallout 2 . It is going to have real time combat . It's basically a top down shooter . The game is story based. Ending depends on choices of the player. \nStory:\n\n(It's a long read )\nThe story is about interplanetary empires. The game has many factions and they will be explained.\n\nPart 1: Introduction\nThe characters is a custom created character. There are many species in the universe but only human character can be created and used. \n\nThe character is born in a Human Colony in a small planet . The planet is not part of any empire nor is it very powerful. It is mostly settled by the U.N and other humans who arrived there long before the characters birth. There has been trade between humans and the Aliens in the solar system. But the UN does carry a military force incase the Aliens go hostile.\n\nThe character is very intelligent and philosophical .Though he joins the planets police force . The empires,planets and states in his solar system have been in some conflict for a long time. Due to concerns over safety most money is going towards research in the army. The solar system hasn't developed since the character was born.\nThe player believes only way for society and the solar system to advance is through peace which can be achieved through total unification. But he doesn't know how he can execute his plan.\n\nFew years later the characters planet is on way to become a battleground. The Skaoburg tribe a Army of orc like creatures built a large Ship capable of interplanetary travel.\n\nThe Skaoburg chief  Vulkar had seen a dream that he would be emperor of all civilizations in the system . So he built a large interplanetary battleship and an armada of interplanetary fighter jets. They move towards the character's planet.  \n\nBut upon arriving the orcs aren't hostile to the humans in the planet . The orcs are there for a deal.\n\nA much larger threat was approaching the characters planet. The Gruthians . These were cultists that worshipped a large lizard named Gruthus. \n\nGruthus was the priest of a long extinct civilization of lizards. While all others went extinct after the planet suddenly released poison from its core Gruthus survived. Then Gruthus continued to survive for  980 more years. When young explorers discovered Gruthus in a planet continuously emitting poison gas from the ground . Gruthus said it was due to his worship and service for blood god Arkius that he was alive. \n\nGruthus convinced the explorers that he was the messanger of Arkius and Sacrificing and converting others to Worship Arkius would make them immortal.\n\nThe explorers were convinced seeing how Gruthus had survived . They went on a terror spree kidnapping people and Sacrificing weak ones while converting the others.\n\nAnd it seemed to be working . Once sacrifices were made to Arkius and Gruthus.Gruthus would give them his blood that increased the strength of the explorers.\n\nSoon many others joined the Gruthian Faith. Fast forward 10 years they become a elite military that take part in holy wars to increase the following of their god.\n\nNow they were invading the main character's planet for spreading their religion. The orcs from Skaoburg are here to negotiate . The orcs can help defend against the Gruthians if they get land for a military base and space station. \n\nWhich the planet grants. Now the player character is a young and healthy person  and is a member of the police so is tasked with defending his town.  He is given a choice between a laser sniper,Energy rifle and ballistic rifle the player can choose any of them each with their own stats. The player along with the orcs force,UN army stationed in the planet and the police take defensive positions . The player and the police are tasked with being skirmishers they are supposed to fire and try to break the cultists ranks and formations and strike weaker spots. The player is asked with leading a flank . But as he is moving towards the cultist army a artillery piece strikes his position killing all men in the players charge. Then the player must carry on alone. First the player destroys enemy machine gun posts and should capture a machine gun . Then the player takes the machine gun and kill all enemies in sight. The player also destroys a vehicle that trailed behind  . Unknown to the player the vehicle had the operation's commander the cultist's head priest. \n\nThe orcs primary strategy is to form a shield wall and fire semi auto rifles. Accurately in a volley . The flanks would normally protected by shock troopers but today they are protected by UN troopers.\n\nMeanwhile the player kills more Gruthian infantry and finds their artillery column which the player destroys. The player does not locate all artillery guns and machine guns but the player has crippled quite a few. So when the Gruthians arrive on the outskirts of the town they grab their rifles and spears and believing they will be covered by fierce artillery, charge at the orcs. Only a few shells crash at the orcs killing only a few orcs. Machine gun support is almost non existent . When the Gruthians charge towards the orcs they are decimated in a volley before they can reach firing range or take positions. The first line moves back other orcs take position and fire a second volley. While police snipers pick off dangerous targets . Then the orcs bring out their auto rifles and start a fire fight\n\nThe player is in the enemy's mg posts at the flank. The player had killed the Gruthians back lines. \n \nThe player should then join the main battle . The player takes his rifle and attacks the enemy . The player kills more Gruthians hiding behind rocks and bombed buildings and some building trenches. \n\nBut he sees the other Gruthians then retreating. The player gets back to the mg post and kills retreating Gruthians  who attempt to capture the mg post. The player makes a heroic stand killing many Gruthians forcing them to run through another path.\n\nThe Gruthians were no match for the well trained orcs after decimating them in a volley the orcs had taken their auto rifles and battle axes and fired at the Gruthians. The Gruthians attempted to retaliate and charge forward but they were killed by orcs firing at them. \n\nAt one point a 100 Gruthians managed to kill a orcs frontline and attempt a counter  charge but they went too close to the orcs. The orcs numbered about 60 but they had battle axes and were highly trained and were wearing heavy armour they killed every single enemy without a single loss and counter charged killing more Gruthians allowing other orcs to counter- charge.\n \nThe Gruthians were no match they retreated to their ship many killed by the player on their way. When the main army found the player they realized what the player had done . The player was the reason the Gruthians didn't have mg or artillery support and the player had killed the high priest.\n\nFor this the player is given a orc battle axe. The player is also given lots of human money by the UN and is promoted to major by the police.\n\nThese actions get the player and other orcs with high kill counts noticed by General Sikirus who is the commander-supreme of the Varcian Empire's army."
fpoyjs,Separate stories,"I think the fire emblem games did this once but idk.  \nMake two games set in the same world, but in each game you experience it from the perspectives of the protagonist/antagonist, and for the final fight, instead of a typical 'you lose, try again' , the ending differs depending on if you win that final fight"
fpodto,Stealth/puzzle platformer where darkness is your friend,"STORY - You start out entering a cave and you get lost before you realize you’ve ventured too far. The only way to go is forward. However, the cave seems to host an ancient ruin, and you plan on investigating it. This is not a complete story and I will improve upon it later.\n\nMECHANICS - There are no weapons, you only have a flashlight. The cave is in complete darkness and you can only see using the flashlight. However, there is a cost; the flashlight attracts monsters in the cavern, who attempt to kill you. You must strategically use your flashlight to avoid falling to these monsters. To make it more challenging, the puzzles will often be related with the flashlight. Overall this game will rely on memory and clever problem solving for most of its puzzles."
fpnbbx,"Fun firefighting game with a mysterious, underlying plot","I'm picturing the setting as a small town surrounded by forests, the player being allowed to roam the town freely but stay within the confines of the town and have missions that progress the story (like Pokémon i guess). Thinking more cartoonish and silly (possibly co-op?) game than life-like and graphic. Could even work as a 2D RPG maybe.\n\nMain Plot:\n\n""You enlist as a volunteer fireman after your house is burned down by an arsonist. You work your way up the ladder fighting fires (both normal and caused via arson), inspecting people's homes, etc., all the while helping the fire chief figure out the identity of the arsonist. The fire chief has beefs with several people in the town, so it's assumed it may be one of them. The police are no help either because they have also don't like the fire chief and unless someone dies or you know for sure who's doing it they won't intervene. After you reach assistant fire chief, you analyze all the clues discovered, study the patterns of the arson, and interview a number of people you may suspect to be the arsonist. You and the fire chief choose someone, they're arrested, happy ending....right? WRONG. You can continue playing the game and be a firefighter to complete all the remaining achievements. One more arson case pops up later after completing all but one achievement. How could this be? You go to the fire chief's home, where it is revealed that....&gt;!You, the player, were the arsonist the entire time! You hated the fire chief because he let your brother die in a house fire when you were a kid. You told him he was the worst fireman ever and that one day you'd take his job and make sure he suffers the same fate. Being a child, no one took the threat seriously, but you remembered, you never forgot. You then set the fire chief's house on fire and the fire chief dies in the flames. You return to the station to proclaim that the fire chief was the real arsonist and has died. They promote you to fire chief and you complete the true ending of the game and earn the final achievement, All Square. Game Over. (not 100% on this backstory).!&lt;\n\nIt's difficult to fully explain an idea in your head in text, and I'm not 100% sure about all the gameplay aspects, it would need to be fun and interesting enough on its own without the plot. Also, please don't hold back any criticism, I'm not super in love with this idea, just don't see many video games centered around firefighters when compared to police officers. Hope everyone is healthy and keeping the creative juices flowing in quarantine!"
fplisq,Looking for a theme for persistent RTS browser game,"Hello everyone,\n\nI love to play games like Travian, Tribalwars, Grepolis, ... but these games have a lot of pay to win mechanics which turned me down these last few years. \n\nI have the time and programming knowledge to create a similar game. But I am a little bit stuck on which theme that I should use?\n\nAny of you have a theme or a setting in which he REALLY wants to play a persistent real time strategy game?\n\nThanks a lot and have a great evening!"
fpkx3k,"So, I was looking the other day at some board games, and I got a creativity rush while looking at them. I came across this pretty fresh and, I hate to say it, but innovative idea.","This game is based around finding diamomds, gold, rare stones, rubys, etc. in Africa.\n\n You can be a good jeweler that doesn't treat his workers bad, gives them  fair wages, but you can be an absolute a**hole that gives his slaves the smallest possible wage and puts  them in awfully inhumane conditions. Or, you know, something in between.\n\n The goal in the game is to be the most succesful jeweler by winning the most points, and/or  having the most money. Points can be earned by doing this things:\n1. Collecting ores (duh)\nA diamond ore is wort the most, then rubys are the second, and gold the least worth.\n2. Building mines, jewelry shops and ports.\n3. Building shops in different countrys\n\nWhen I think of this game, I always envision it's graphics to be like hand drawn, with a muddy and earthy tone. Also the characters and enviorment in the game should look like its ""sketched"" ( like not perfect outlines and stuff, but ""sketchy"" look)\n\nI envision it as a board game, but if it was a computer or mobile game it would be super cool too!\n\n*Some details*: The map is the middle and  southern Africa, players can choose where to build their first port, and if it is a board game it should have cards, dice, and some miniatures.\n\nI hope you like the idea :)\n\nAnd if anyone decides to use my idea (which is very unlikely), please contact me at borna.silver@gmail.com , then we can talk."
fpjocv,Someone please make this,"I don't have much money but I'll find some way to pay whoever makes this. To the idea. An open-world FPS survival game (preferably in console) where you play as a criminal/terrorist in a country where law enforcement is virtually non existent. That country is being invaded. You (the player) get to set traps in forests, ambush supply routes, and a lot more. There would be stats, think fallout's special. Each stay would be capped at 7\n\nFeatures\n\nFeatures 1\nCompanions: you can have 2 dogs, 2 humans, plus however you allocate your charisma points, basically you can recruit dogs and humans based on your charisma, for every point of charisma you can get 1 human or 2 dogs. \n\nFeatures 2\nTarkov like inventory: basically everything has a certain amount of space it takes up. For instance a pistol may be 1 by 2 spots and you may have a 10 by 5 inventory. Tarkov's magazine system would be in place too.\n\nFeature 3\nRealistic gun features: on a dry reload if you insert a 30 round mag and pull the charging handle, the gum has 30 rounds, if reload on that you switch the mags and get 31 rounds. Guns will also need to be cleaned and repaired.\n\nIf interested in more information please dm me."

fpcpoj,Ideas for new mechanics and bringing it together,"Hi guys\n\nI'm making a game prototype and I need some help.\n\nIt lacks some cool mechanics.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's like [agar.io](https://agar.io) (2d) mobile game but in singleplayer.\n\nYou are collecting particles which is randomly spawned. \n\nThere are another particles that disturb you from moving around the board (you bounce back from them).\n\nYour goal is to kill/neutralize some enemies (You can kill one if you collect e.g. 10 good particles) before they explode.\n\nWhen they explode they are releasing another group of particles which are slowing you down (if you collide with them) and take good particles which you collected before\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCore is simple - There are just a lot of different particles and a few levels (map's getting bigger, more enemies to kill, respawn time)\n\nThere are some other features like:\n\nSpeed boost - you can use particles that you collected to be faster and see more of a map\n\nTornado - throws you around the map\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOf course there are some upgrades (speed, kill time, particle magnet).\n\nThe game has a main theme and cool graphic desing but it obviously lacks of something, something simple but unique. \n\nAnd I really need your help guys, just throw some ideas. I don't have anyone to talk with about this concept and I need new perspective."
fpb4tc,Story/player progression idea for RPG(like) game,"Premise similar to Darkest Dungeon - you inherit a village/homestead, which is all basically ruined, except for your house specifically.  Then you venture out from this village to clear dungeons, do quests, pretty much standard RPG fare. The story would thematically have to be about self-reliance (or selfishness when taken to extreme) versus community (or dependence, when taken to extreme) to fit in with the mechanic.\n\nYou don't get XP, but you get some tokens for finishing quests, and now:  \nYou can either spend the token to make your character more powerful (get a new ability), or to repair part of the village, and get a new citizen/potential party/army member to move in.\n\nWhen going out for new quests, you can ""call in"" your citizens into your party/army.\n\nThe progression would be tuned so that:\n\nThe character progression would increase player's power the same as the village progression.\n\nNumber of available tokens is precisely as much as you need to max out the character progression OR the village progression.\n\nIf a character in your party/army dies, they're dead for good and their house falls to ruin again.\n\nMeaning there's about three distinctive potential endings:\n\nYou max out your character, and you're the winner, a godlike powerful being, in the world, and completely lonely, living in a ruined village by yourself.\n\nOr, you max out your village, and if you play well enough, you end up a winner in a beautiful village, but you're just a normal boring mortal... with lots of friends and people who care about you.\n\nOr, you max out your village, and if you play badly enough, even if you win, you let all/most of your citizens to die in the process, so you end up a pyrrhic winner, just a mere mortal, in a ruined village.\n\nLots of space for ""going at it alone vs. getting friends"" topical thoughts in the story. \n\nIt's just a fuzzy thing, but I like the idea of the last quest either being you as almost a god doing against a literal army of enemies and feeling like a badass and then coming back to the ruined village for contrast, as the ending, or you as a mortal leader of your own army going against the enemy army, and then going back to the village, hopefully still having some friends left, and mourning them, and talking about how you could have saved them if only you personally were a bit more powerful. In a way, achieving the ""true good ending"" (you collect all the friends and all survive) would be the hardest, and the other two endings (you a lonely god, vs. you a mortal with SOME friends left) would reference each other wishfully as the better option."
fpafdb,Musical Multiplayer FPS,"Kind of a dumb idea I had a while ago. Could be fun, but probably more suited for a mod or a non-lucrative project, as it wouldn't sell (i think).\n\n\- Basically, it's a classic FPS, with team deathmatch, deathmatch and the like. It would probably be better if the game is kind of ""nervous"", like Quake for example.\n\n\- Every map has a unique ""background soundtrack"". The game ends when the soundtrack is over.\n\n\- Weapons picked up on the map act like musical instruments, and can be heard by other players when they fire. The number, variety, and sound made by the weapons have to be finely tuned to make the whole thing interesting to hear. Weapons would make different sounds based on the map they are on.\n\nThat's pretty much it. Hope you like it, feel free to use."
fpa82d,Superheroic XCOM-like,"There are already a plethora of XCOM-like games on the market, but the gameplay fits so well with the superheroic genre i can't see why it wouldn't work.\n\nI even made a tabletop version of the concept and it worked pretty well overall during playtests. But since i'll never make a videogame out of it, i might as well share it to people with the appropriate skills.\n\n\-----------------------CONCEPT KEY-POINTS\n\n\- You are the chief of a superheroic agency (a justice league of sorts, or maybe supervillains why not). You have a concealed base not unlike XCOM, which can be upgraded with various rooms giving bonuses and enabling crafting or research.\n\n\- You can recruit randomised ""heroes wanna be"" with superheroic quirks, which will develop in power as they gain experience in missions. Maybe including fame and media exposure would be interesting.\n\n\- Superpowers could be ""classes"" if you want to go simple. You could also have something more of a ""Champions Online"" feel with a possibility to combine powers and make multi-class heroes. The Champions pen and paper RPG can be a good source of inspiration for the various possibilities (but please don't take inspiration from that game's entire ruleset... please).\n\n\- XCOM gameplay, maybe just more revolving around powers and less around weapons.\n\n\- Character customization is essential I think : costumes, gadgets, names, voices, victory poses, music... the more the better. The XCOM-2 feature of creating character outside of campaign and that you can recruit while in campaign would be great too. Being able to re-create heroes you like is an important part of the concept. Steam workshop or similar and mod-support would be a great plus.\n\n\- Character traits could be interesting. ""enrages easily"", ""must not kill"", ""panics easily""... can be moral code or simple trauma, can be positive or negative... it would add some flavour and challenge to each character.\n\n\- Main enemy could of course be ""Evil Corp"" if you want to go simple. If you don't mind complicating things, you could make a ""villain designer"" along with the ""hero designer"". The point of the game would be to put all of the randomly chosen rooster of villain behind bars before they do some ""evil deed"" or simply bring chaos to the city/world/place around the game revolves.\n\n\- Using something similar to ""Shadow of war"" mechanics would be awesome, but very complicated to do i guess. In shadow of war, orcs react to the player's actions. Here, supervillains would remember heroes that they defeated, or that have beaten them, and say things accordingly... or even develop counters for them. Villains would gain levels just like heroes do, and become more and more difficult to beat each time you meet them. \n\n\- Missions would remind of all the [classic superhero scenarios](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperheroTropes) ; ""Free the hostages"", ""catch the bank robbers"", ""flee from a supervillain trap"", ""prevent the superlaser from firing"", ""defend your secret base"", ""prevent the villain you captured from breaking out of prison""... most of generic comics scenario can be made into some kind of XCOM-scenario, meaning the game could have a lot of variety.\n\n\- The universe could be straightforward good vs evil, or you could go for a more shades of grey approach... or maybe make the whole organisation you work for [secretly evil](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilAllAlong).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere ! That's all folks ! Hope you like it, feel free to use it. Please contact me if you have any questions."
g3xgml,A katana Zero esque game but more things added on (also I don't know how the flair system works so sorry if I used the incorrect one),"(Before I explain I just want to apologize for the trash story and idea you're about to expeirience).\n\nWhat I mean is that it's like Katana Zero in the sense where it's a 2d side scroller and your character is a super human sword swinging badass with amnesia.\n\n  For combat I was thinking of there being a gun and sword slot (one for each hand) but you can equip your gun in your right hand (more accuracy and higher firing rate) and you sword in you left hand ( lower damage and swing speed) and vice-versa and you would attack with the two bumpers (L2/R2 for PS4 and LT/RT for XBOX). For attacking I thought there could be three types: kick for stunning enemies and doing small damge (circle button for PS4 and B button on Xbox),\nLight attacks for sword/gun combos on stunned enemies or just for spam-ability (Square button in PS4 or X botton on Xbox) and finaly... heavy attack for straight up  PUNISHING enemies (Triangle on PS4 or Y on Xbox). Finally for the special ability, I thought about how it would be cool if our hero could plan ahead. What I mean is that time would slow down and you would plan what would happen like the combat system in Transitor (if anybody knows that game) but the catch (so it can't be abused)is that, doing this takes a heavy strain on the body and can be harmful if used too frequently. \n\n  Now for movement,\nI was thinking of a run and jump system with some extra thing added on. For starters I though it would be cool if you could combo a kick and a jump resulting in using an enemy's face as a jump-pad or you if you run into an enemy and combo a kick which would send them flying foward , a light attack would be a stun (I guess)? And a heavy attack would just kill them.\n\n  For story I really got nothing except you get rescued from a shady government lab by a rebellion (who are secretly just using you to topple the existing government and replace it with their new regeim). Who which enlist you too assaniate people (toppling the government in the process).\n\n\nAgain, I apologize for the shit encrusted bomb of an idea I just dropped on all of you but I open to critisicim."

g3rz26,Futuristic F-Zero Style Racer But With A Focus On Natural Scenery And Long Flowing Turns,"Saw this game in a dream and I think it would be pretty cool.\n\nBasically a game similar to F-Zero but which tests your ability to use subtle turning and control of speed rather than twitch reflexes. A sense of speed and danger would be maintained by having narrower tracks, receiving very high damage from impacts and very few guard rails.\n\nBeautiful natural scenery such as canyons, mountains and coast-lines would be a big part of the appeal and the tracks would be designed to fit around the scenery without being intrusive enough to ruin the natural beauty."

g3e6j8,"A first-person action game with teleportation powers like Nightcrawler, but to teleport you actually have to pass through a mazelike nightmare dimension that plays like a horror game.","So essentially Nightcrawler's powers, except you get to experience moving through an [insidious, claustrophobic alternate dimension](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDaT0fstWVs) with gameplay similar to P.T. or Dreadhalls until you find the exit point to emerge on the other side of the teleportation. As you can imagine, using your teleportation powers in the action part of the game is nearly a last-resort option.\n\nStory wise, find out you have the ability to pass through a spiritual realm and emerge in another location. A paramilitary force begins hunting you so you take it upon yourself to fight back and uncover the truth. At first the spiritual realm is rather peaceful, but soon you realize something in there doesn't want you there.

I also want to have fun exclusives to draw people to my platform, so if any of you are interested tell me all about your game idea. If you want to wait for a full prototype to be made, we can keep in touch. I’m really excited to see your ideas."
g35mve,A kingdom come style mmo based in ancient rome,Imagine a mix of kingdom come's visuals meets eso meets animal crossings menial tasks. You would start as different levels of Roman society based on stats chosen with ability to move up through completion of quest like activities paired with a morality and relationship mechanic. Idk just an idea but it could be fun if someone could make it feel like moving up in society is actually difficult.
g33kwy,Zero negative feedback kids game about finding animals,"Core mechanic like in minesweeper. But instead of finding bombs, you find animals. If you find one, you can pet it (somehow), and make it join you (or you simply collect it as a trophy). If you accidentally reveal animal without finding it first, it simply runs away.\n\nWhat do you think about this?\n\nThe problems I have with this idea:\n- how to reward the player, so that it will be better to make the least number of moves possible?\n- how to pet the animal? Feed it or something?\n- what would be the point of playing the game? \n- what could be the game progress?"
g30d12,Interesting idea for a hostage situation/bank robbing game,"How about a game (mechanic) in which you spend time preparing for a hostage situation et cetera as a criminal, buying guns, setting up plans, hiring members, bribing people and then executing the job and putting up defenses against the cops up until the police show up and then you switch roles and have to resolve the situation as a leader of a SWAT-Team, either non-lethal (preferable) or lethal (in the way of the old SWAT games \[...damn... am I really this old?\]), bringing an end to the situation or the other way round, where you take actions as a cop to F up the criminals and then you have to get out of it.\n\nSo you sabotage yourself on two ends and for the first time it could be an interesting suprise, of course it would lose its charm rather quickly, it's probably something you only pull off one time.\n\nCould also be funny in multiplayer, one is the criminal, the other is the cop and then the roles switch. Maybe there are multiple criminals and cops and it's random who switches."
g2zsn8,A military strategy simulation game with anime style,"A game very similar to HOI, CK or EU but the only difference is that the art style is anime-ish."
g2xjo1,Games for Women,"Remember Doom from not too long ago? Take the same game, but reskin all the demons to be pejoratives of facist with futuristic industrial style sci fi tech. Make the Doom slayer a hot as hell swoled up feminist who has just fucking had it! Same weapons, same mechanics, same carnage, more catharsis."
g2x9pl,I need simple ideas for a demo game for my engine I have built for a school project,"I have made a 2d game engine in c++ and I would love to get some ideas about what game (or games) I should make with it. \nIt is built to run games like classic Mario, and Pokémon, but I added real time shadows to it in order to make it unique. \nIf you have an idea for a relatively simple game that can incorporate real time shadows I would like to hear it and many code it. Thanks"
g2vt72,A reverse hunting game,"A game in which you are the last of your kind, and your being hunted by poachers. It takes place in the African savanna, in the colonial era. You can choose between an endangered tiger, hippo, elephant, and possibly more. Each one has their own perks and disadvantages. The goal is to make it to night to sleep and regain health (and possibly a skill tree of sorts).\n\nWhile you progress through the game your species slowly starts to appear more. This gains access to herds or whatever the appropriate term is. As the population of your species grows you'll attract more hunters, but as a herd you have a chance to defend yourself.\n\nHeavy animals such as hippos or elephants can ram their carts or just stampede the hunters themselves. Predatory animals such as tigers or lions can, instead of resting at night, actually hunt down the poachers. Smaller animals such as birds or meerkats have increased escape options, such as hiding in burrows or just flying away."
g2vnpy,a Paris open world zombie survival,"a open world zombie game that takes place in Paris, the story is you’re a scout collecting samples for a cure, but you get stuck and a scientist finds you and saves you just before you die. The scientist shows you his research and he’s very close to finishing it and needs you to search for a source. He gives you specific places to search in Paris such as the catacombs. Down there you find a superbacteria, that you believe was ground zero for the virus. You get lost on your way out and have to fight normal to evolved zombie species and get the sample to the scientist and help to create a cure"
g2va1v,A demon slayer x sekiro type game.,"Demon Slayer, or kimetsu no yair a has a large and growing fanbase, and many people love games with the difficulty and fluidity of sekiro. Not o ly that, but they both capitalize on the samurai/ninja theme, and it would be an amazing fit that almost every demon slayer fan would buy."
g2urvc,A Dead by Daylight style game but it’s 2 killers,
g2s5xe,Mimic and knight: appetite for riches,"This game has been slowly cooked up in my mind, the concept is as easy as Wario land, get as much treasure as possible\n\nThe motive: the main character needs food to survive the winter, without much out of scavenging, he opts to go search treasure to be able to afford enough to live through winter, while battling the first boss, a mimic, your sword breaks, as you deal the last blow to knock out the mimic, a quick deal happens to get the mimic new foods to taste, and the mimic will join as your weapon from now on\n\nThe gameplay: the game style is a metroidvania platformer, with the main mechanic being that you'll aquire new limb transformations for the mimic, and charms and medals for the knight to wear that will give new abilities, as well as learning new techniques for the limb shapes\n\nThe world: the beginning will be linear, teaching you the basics, up until you aquire the first new limb shape, after that, you'll be free to chose where to go and what to do, your journey will end once you choose to finish, and depending on what level of completion you'll get an ending, the place you'll be playing in is a giant mountain with different environments and filled with secrets, as well as charming characters and extra stuff to do\n\nAs of now this is a concept I wanna perfect before starting production, the map, mechanics, items and all, set them and then start developing, I accept questions and suggestions"
g2omfv,An open world RPG where the player only wants to get rich,"I was thinking of a bright zelda-like open world where instead of having an epic storyline to follow, the player is presented with several tools to achieve a single objective: getting rich. You could be a traveling merchant, a hunter or even a criminal. Maybe the player could choose some sort of starting role, like a guild rookie in a big city or a caravan helper on a frontier region. Dangerous creatures could be present on the wilderness, making travel dangerous and also creating the possibility for the player to earn money by hunting them or just trading their parts. There could also be the possibility to do criminal stuff, like dealing in contraband or stealing cargo from other merchants. The player could have the possibility to invest or even create their own business."
g2o76f,A Viking Style Game,"I fell in love when shadow of war got released I always enjoyed the idea of conquering new areas &amp; defeating unique bosses &amp; I’ve always been fascinated by Norse mythology &amp; just the idea of Vikings in general. It’s Not that I want anyone to make this exact idea but maybe this sparks other, new ideas in the minds of devs. But I’d love to one day see a Norse styled game similar to shadow of war where you conquer &amp; rule over areas &amp; command armies! With maybe the idea of Norse gods being involved. Possibly invoking you with powers you could use like lightning or Thor’s hammer🤷🏽‍♂️ This idea may never come to light but this is really just a shower thought I wanted to share!"
g2nj3l,VR matrix video game,So I had this shower thought we’re your a command troop of the human race and it take place during the 3 film of the matrix so your get ready for war  and you get ready fight the sentinels and you get in one of the meek suits and you fight them off until your over weld and you have to fight and a grunt with the lighting gun and there a twist we’re your in a pre movies so your with a different choosn one as you are one of the 20 people to rebuild Zion

g2juod,FEARS,"I wanna make a video game about fears and situations that may trigger those fears and I want y'all to comment situations that may be terrifying or really scary, whether it be a jump scare, something that makes you freeze, send shivers down your spine, anything like that, if you have a personal fear or phobia, comment something that would trigger those fears or if you know of a phobia and a situation that would greatly trigger it please comment down below it would help a lot, thanks"
g2jkfw,New Game Console - Day 2,"I’m posting a bit early today, but I had to I’ve had so many ideas since last night. I figured, VR is the future, or at least that’s what people are saying. The problem is people don’t want to buy a $400 headset with little to no games. So, the plan is to go the Nintendo route, create a less powerful, cheap, but nice headset. I’m gonna try to aim for the 50 - 100 mark. I realize I need a lot of exclusives at launch, so if you guys have any game ideas tell me in the comments. It would be nice to launch with -\n\n. A FPS with a main campaign and fleshed our multiplayer akin to Goldeneye\n\n. A first person semi open world adventure game  Elder scrolls meets Legend of Zelda\n\n. Some sort of game with a mascot for the company\n\nI really wanna take that PlayStation and N64 era of consoles and put them in a vr environment. \n\nAs for the consoles main feature, the VR isn’t built into the headset, but instead it’s a tablet like device akin to the Gameboy advance or Switch that can be popped in and out of the headset to play in handheld mode or VR. Very similar to Labo Vr or Phone Vr, but actually high quality and fun. A little slider on the top changes the mode between handheld and vr mode. If you have any ideas please post them in the comments. I’ll probably post a second part later this afternoon."
g2is57,A game about data corruption,"(Please bear in mind that i am in no way a technical expert and have very little idea in what im talking about) In this game you are playing as an anti-virus to prevent files from being corrupted by a malicious program. It is a tower-defense/management game. On the left side of the screen is the entry area. This is the tower-defense area, you put turrets (Any suggestions for types of turret?) and traps of sorts on this half of the screen as well as gain currency for turrets and for the right side of the screen.\n\nSpeaking of the right side, this is where the management comes into play. The tower-defense part is made only as a partial prevention, to soften the blow, when a virus breaches the gates it will infect a file. Files are represented as a variation of icon (Maybe with special abilities for each icon?) e.g. .png icon, folder icon, .exe icon, etc. When a file gets infected it will turn green and attempt to infect other files via physical contact. The moment patient zero gets infected alarms go off and 'guards' are introduced. Guards are made to safely transport infected files to the quarantine zone (More about this later.)\n\nNow, it takes CPU, RAM, and other resources to keep everything running. You can focus your resources on either side of the screen by a little slider of some sorts. CPU speeds up turrets or slows down viruses, RAM acts as a buffer for turrets, allowing them to enter a faster state for a short time or acts as an emergency quarantine zone incase the guards are already busy. Disk increases the strength of turrets or summons more guards. GPU increases the quality of turrets, making them slightly better in all regards or gives the antivirus a better picture of the situation, allowing for more efficient testing/research.\n\nThe quarantine zone is where files will be researched in order to find more out about the virus. This will unlock skill points that can be used to upgrade guards and unlock new turrets/traps. You have limited quarantine space and limited 'researchers'. You will be able to visualize how badly someone is infected by how green they are and dedicate resources to them appropriately."
g2gw8f,"I, an indie dev, need your ideas for an upcoming title!","Long story short, I'm making a game in which you, the protagonist, is a toilet with bare human legs. The game is a 2D platformer with a momentum-based character controller.\n\nI would like ideas regarding the following topics:\n\n* Setting / Environment\n* Enemies\n* Abilities\n* Story\n\nThanks!"
g2e7dj,A game that is a virtual Catholic confessional booth,"You are given tasks and boss fights as penance depending on the sins you confess, but they occur in a cycle like the Rosary, and also involve completing so many Hail Marys and Our Fathers while fighting off minions.\n\nThe best part: indulgences are available as in-app purchases."
g2d5la,The osu equivalent to a Vr rhythm game,"Like how osu has mania, taiko, catch, and osu. But with the vr rhythm modes.\n\nSo like you could choose to play the synth rider type, beatsaber type, audica type, o shape type, and which ever ones I forgot (audica and pistol whip are counted as one here).\n\nOfcourse they wont be titled the the games their definitely not stolen from, so you'd have a gun mode, saber mode, rail mode, and holl mode, or something of the sorts. \n\nOfcourse all community driven, with decent multiplayer modes, and easy to download maps, and maybe a skinning system similar to osu's.\n\nAlso with a deco system again similar to osu's. As in being able to add custom 3d animation. And having the equivalent of osu's story boarding.\n\nAs a bonus what if you could have a complex mode where the level could be mapped and played in every mode simultaneously. So you hit block notes with your sabers, hold your hand whare need be for rails and shoot sky target notes with your gun, (all weapons automatically switching when needed) and wth the walls from o shape as well in one map all at once.\n\nAlso just for community's sake, decently easy moding support.\n\nI can't be the only vr rythm game lover who would want this to exist."
g2csis,"Coronatimes - two teams (team corona of infected people, team humans of uninfected)","The game board can be a city map with squares for necessities (grocery stores etc), and joy (parks) and work (can get money tokens to buy sanitizer shields) and home-square.\n\n\nThe goal of team corona is to infect all humans, by going to the same non-home square as a human. Team corona wins if all humans can be converted to corona.\n\n\nThe goal of team humans is to survive, with the requirement that they must buy 10 tokens worth of necessities once every 10 moves, and must visit one joy square every 20 moves (can tweak exact token/moves system). Sanitizer shields gives immunity for next 3 turns or whatever. Money tokens can be earned by visiting work square. Or every few rounds the bank/gubmint gives you money also.\n\n\nAfter say, 50 total rounds, a vaccine square will be enabled which every human must reach to win/end the game."
g2c0eg,A battle royale game where you play as hoodlum.,"I know it is another battle royale game idea but here me out. \nYou will be sent to an abandoned town/city to fight other players. There is no shrinking zone, but there will be exploding device implanted on you. This can explode if you are not moving for a certain period of time. \n\nEnvironment: there will be abandoned shops where you can decorate yourself, there will be creatures out on the street that you will need to kill to cleanse the city.  \n\nGameplay: killing creatures or enemies gives you points to order weapons which will be delivered by a drone. There will be sanity level which decrease gradually, once it reach zero you will be shouting/chanting or revealing your location to other players. To prevent that you will need to kill other player or creatures. Once a number of creatures have been killed, a key will spawn at a random location. It is a key to removing the implant whoever gets it need to go to another point to leave the place. Once the key is retrieved, it shows the location of the carrier to other players \n\nWeapons: they will have recoil and weight. Bombs/grenades can cause a very loud sound that decrease your sanity if you are near it. \n\nMission: there will be mission to complete through the map such as prevent the store from looting, cleanse the street filled with creature, putting bounty on someone’s head(like in war zone)"
g2a72m,New Game Console - Day 1,"This isn't a game idea, but instead a console idea I have. I plan to post a new entry to this log every day, documenting the new ideas I come up with and the overall development. I want to combine the retro feel of consoles like the N64, PS1, and Gamecube with modern consoles like the PS4. If you have any game ideas for my new console, or any features you want to see in this new console, please tell me. Feedback is more than welcome. Next post is tomorrow sometime after 12:00."
g286ic,Day 1 - Game Console Log,[deleted]
g25gtg,"A game where you spawn in a highly detailed supermarket where you can just destroy everything to let out your anger. You can destroy any shelves and products, break in to the back rooms and offices and destroy stuff. This sounds a bit sinister but would be the greatest stress relief in the world.",[deleted]
g25fkl,"A James Bond/ Spy game that involves a free roam map with the whole of central London in GTA level of detail and involves car chases, foot chases, story mode and properly decent tailing, hunting and sniping gameplay.",[deleted]
g25dtb,A proper pirate game where you captain huge ships that are actually full size with masses of different rooms and a highly detailed boat. Sea of Thieves and Black Flag are fun but they obviously arent trying to create pirate ships anywhere near realistic size.,[deleted]
g235eo,Not a game idea but an idea that we could implement in games.,"Instead of having arbitrary sensitivities in video games, we should instead have an angle calculator sensitivity. For example you would type down the length of your mouse pad and the angle you would want your crosshair to travel for sliding your mouse that length, i.e : In csgo with a qck heavy you would have to set your sensitivity to 2.4 in game and 400 dpi in order to do a 360 degrees when sliding your mouse from one edge to the other, valve could add an option with the qck heavy 360 degrees sensitivity as reference and then you would just have to put your personal mouse pad length and the angle you want your crosshair to travel one sliding your mouse from one end to another. Simple cross multiplication.\n\nEdit : I think adding an option such as (cm/360°) or (cm/180°) for both hipfire and ads is much better and simpler actually. So 2.4 ingame and 400dpi in csgo is approximatively (45cm/360°)."
g22wdy,"A Virtual Reality, Incremental Upgrade Game.","With VR on the rise, and better and better games coming out every day, I’ve been brainstorming VR game ideas. \n\nThe idea I had was a VR game tower defense style game where you take on waves of zombies, collect coins every round, buy new weapons, ammo, and upgrade your shelter. The game would be similar to “The Last Stand” which is an old online flash game.\n\nLet me know what you guys think about the idea, and I’ll go more into detail about how I imagine the game and how it would be played. Also, If there’s any games like this out there, I’d be happy to hear and learn about them!"
g1zhmt,war of the worlds,"a apocalyptic alien invasion game. based on the new show and movie. set place in Las angelos, you switch body's and play as different people. there would be like the telltale mode and the normal mode you can also change the difficultly.  "
g1zhbs,Non-euclidean VR,"A VR game with no teleporting/joysticks, just walking around in your play-space of Non-euclidean places randomly generated, or levels that other people made with the editor.\n\nSearch Tea For God VR for a good example of Non-euclidean worlds."
g1z89d,a 2 player game about the relationship between humans and a dragon.,"so this game has two gameplay modes, the first is humans. human mode plays  like an rts, with both military and survival elements. you start at the stone age and progress all the way up to modern society, pretty standard. the second mode is dragon mode, which is played by another player in the same world. in this mode you directly control a dragon, progressing from hatchling to adulthood. there are some survival elements (mostly hunger) but the real focus is the leveling up system. there are three quest types you can complete; first, theres the benevolent quests, which focus on helping the humans, then theres aggressive quests, which focus on harming the humans, lastly theres neutral quests, which are quests that don't really fall into either group. these quests reward you exp, which you use to grow and get new skills. this system is meant to encourage interacting with the humans, and developing a relationship with the humans, whether good or bad. the game would probably be difficult to balance, as the power dynamic between humans and dragons would cause many players to be infuriated in certain situations no matter how you make it, but i think the idea has potential."
g1xe6n,"A MGS gameboy type game but when caught it goes into a fallout-2esque, good idea?",I just want to see if this seems like a good idea for anyone else. \n\n[i](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOIe1bcWAn0)magine the original metal gears on the msx2 and mgs ghost babel but every time you're caught you go into a battle scenario in which you go into an rpg scene where the main focus is aiming at enemies and their parts like VATS a la Fallout 2. \n\nWould this be annoying? my main goal is to have the stealth aspect to be the main puzzle and the rpg element be a quick punishment for being caught. In comparison to Metal gear your consequence for being  caught would be running and hiding or  shooting your way out. My main concern that these aspects may not mesh well and just wanted to run this idea by some people.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI want to do this because I need a good programming project and to actually have something under my name even if incomplete.
g1wy3q,A game about body snatching,"You operate in a village and its surrounding countryside during the 17th century. You have all night to dig graves and steal corpses, or you can just take their belongings which is quicker but yields less money. Then you have to transport anything you take back to your den or to a buyer without being caught. What you carry with you affects mobility. You can also find NPCs who will contract you to do specific tasks. During the day you can prepare for the next harvest and gather information on recent deaths so you know which graves are likely to have good loot and fresh bodies. Occasionally bodies can be found elsewhere (executed criminal, farming accident), any fresh body you find is just as good as the next one. There can be a number of ways to conceal and transport bodies and loot, such as sacks, chests, and carts. Cemeteries that are raided often may add patrols or lock their gates so you need to change up your routine. There is some combat, but it's very easy to die and is used only as a last resort. You use your earnings to buy food and supplies as well as tools to make yourself more industrious. And of course there would be some kind of endgame, which may be more story driven. It's one part stealth, one part survival adventure, and one part business sim."
g1uiia,Rogue like dungeon crawler with terraria and minecraft elements,"#The main games I'm taking inspiration from are games like dark cloud (which I grew up on), dark souls, dragons dogma and of course as the title mentioned terraria and minecraft (to a lesser extent).\n\n#The basic premise I have in mind would be that 10,20 or however many players would be spawned into a single world, these players are permanent to that world so you have to figure out how to deal with each other on your own. In the world there would be a single tower (or multiple ones perhaps) that would act as the dungeon which you progress through level by level each level holding different and unique biomes (maze like dungeon with doors leading to random locations reminiscent of the research hall in bloodborne, otherworldly forest area with giant glowing trees, an underground tomb you get to by going down instead of up at the start etc) if you stay outside of the world you can use the surroundings to craft tools, buildings and basically have a player made city. \n\n#There are far less dangers in the outside world but if you do die its permadeath and you'll have to create a new character losing the skills you've built up (also character stats are random on creation with maybe a free reroll or 2 and otherwise customizable later on in game) whereas if you die in the tower you become 'bound' to it gaining the ability to be reborn within it at the cost of becoming unable to leave it or if you do you start to take increasingly heavy dmg whilst outside and dying outside the tower would also result in permadeath, this would only be reversible by killing a 10th floor boss or the like which would release you until you died in the tower again. \n\n#For the sake of convenience let's say you gain souls by killing enemies, dying in the tower allows you to use those souls to strengthen, customize and even transform your character by giving them inhuman attributes (in my mind there would even be a 'humanity' meter where if it dipped below 50% or the like you would basically become a monster in the dungeon yourself until you raised it back up thus opening up options to turn yourself into a lich or some shit) this would be the only way to upgrade your character beyond learning basic skills like swordplay or evasive maneuvers which simply get better as you use them.\n\n#Basically you would eventually WANT to die so as to spend your souls (unused souls would be discarded upon rebirth) but you drop all of your equipment when you die and would have to go back to get it hoping the someone else doesn't steal them in the process or that humanoid monsters dont do the same, at the same time the longer you go without dying the more souls you will gain from enemies from a multiplier mechanic (I know this part is a bit iffy and would need some work so it isn't abused but I would rlly like to see it implemented in some way).\n\n#Players bound to the dungeon would also be able to craft and make towns in certain levels as well so as to have there own custom made hubs and create higher lvl equipment from materials only found in the tower.\n\n#Realistically there would be maybe 4 or 5 biomes that could be generated each floor, in order to keep things fresh as long as possible my idea is that these biomes would also have randomized elements so let's say you get a glowy mushroom forest biome the has fire element and so everything is a crimson hue the lakes are lava making them death hazards until you could find a lava potion or the like and it has unique enemies to that element then next time you get that same biome but with ice so this time it has a cold blue glow, the lakes are frozen and you can walk over them or melt them and swim underneath opening new areas and of course unique enemies. \n\n#The tower(s) would technically be infinite, levels randomly generating each new floor.\n\n#I have more I can add but I'm tired so I'll stop here for now if you have questions I'll answer them in the comments section. also this is my first post on here so have mercy lol"
g1p6bf,Supermarket Drifting,"Yup. You already know those trolleys get drifting around the supermarket isles. Cart customisation, infinite possibilites of shops and tracks (you could even use the car park outside), trolley tandems, an entire empty trolley you could fill with cosmetic items if some sort of leveling and earning system was introduced.\n\nI have no knowledge on even starting to make a game but this would be something I could sink hours into"
g1nyot,An Open world Naruro MMORPG in the style of Skyrim,[deleted]
g1ly2y,What would you want from a pirate game where you play as the pirate ship?,"So i’m creating a pirate game for my uni and my teacher said that for now I should keep it simple so just play as the ship.\n\nYou will be able to choose from 4 different ships and each ship has its own unique ultimate attack which are different and have different effects on enemies, each ship has an immunity and passive ability as well\n\nThere will be cannon fire, enemy ships, enemy creatures, unique enemies.\n\nThings like skeleton ships and ghosts ships and different unique creatures.\n\nWhat else would you want from a pirate game like this?"
g1iblo,a warioware+survival game.,"in this game you play as someone stranded in the arctic (or some kind of other snowy cold place) and you start in possession of a portable gaming console, this console is one of your only sources of heat in this cold desolate place. at any time you can pull out the console to play a simple warioware type game, (little microgames you can complete in a few seconds). winning a game causes the console to generate heat, but losing a game causes the console to use up more power, meaning that if you want to keep warm without running out of batteries you have to play skillfully, otherwise the game plays like a standard survival game, with a large focus on temperature, with features such as being able to scavenge warm clothes that decrease temperature loss, and buildings which offer a bit more insulation than the snowy expanse. i know this game idea is absurd but i still think it is interesting. what do you think?"
g1i3g6,Hyrule vs. Mushroom Kingdom,"In this new MMO, the Mushroom Kingdom and Hyrule at war with each other. Choose whether you want to be a toad, goomba, koopa, Kong, Zora, Goron, Deku or Sheik (including DK with the Mushroom Kingdom since he originated in a Mario game and Mario's world isn't as diverse as Zelda's), then begin fighting for your kingdom against the other. Each kingdom would have graphics similar to Mario 64 and OoT respectively.\n\nMushroom Kingdom characters would use cartoony, Mario-style head-jumps, hammers and fire pellets like in Mario games, while the Hylians would use bows, swords, etc., with control schemes optimized separately for these different playstyles and tones. Maybe each race could also have moves that are unique to them. Kongs could be a wildcard, since they vary so greatly between DK Country games, 64, etc. Shout they get coconut guns and stuff?\n\n Unlock yoshis on the MK side or horses on the Hylian side if you need a steed. Horses are faster and hardier, yoshis are slower and fragile but can nom people as yoshis are known to do, maybe hover like in Galaxy 2.\n\nEdit: Forgot to add my thoughts on the map. Hyrule can be easily modeled after OoT or even twilight princess directly, given how open and developed LoZ worlds tend to be, but it'd be harder for Mushroom Kingdom since it tends to be in Fractals with loading screens or abstract nodal maps between. 64 doesn't even let you go anywhere outside the castle. We'd have to stitch together various shards from different games to make a somewhat intelligible mushroom kingdom."
g1g9q9,"An open world ""slasher"" game","The core of the game would be the constant feeling of being hunted. You would be thrown into a procedurally generated post-apocalyptic map and you wear nothing but rags and no weapon but your fists. You have been exiled from your town because of the mysterious mark on your forehead, that is considered a danger for everyone around you. After one day passes, you will be informed that the most powerful enemy of the game has spawned somewhere on the map and is now heading toward your location. You cannot kill it through conventional means and it will stop at nothing to get to you and kill you.\n\nYou can shake off your pursuer by hiding or putting a distance between you and it, but it will eventually know where you are: you both share a link that causes you to have random visions of where it is or vice-versa. That is why you are constantly on the move. And don't expect help from any person you meet; they will run away or threaten you at the sight of the mark on your head; nope, you are on your own.\n\nYour objectives are the following: (1) Survive your pursuer. (2)  Manage your Hunger, Thirst and Sleep bars. (3) Find a way to kill the pursuer with the clues around the map and the indications shown in your visions... or just accept your fate.\n\nThat's only the skeleton of the game, but I think it would make for a very unnerving and nerve-racking experience."
g1fajd,House Flipper in VR,"Fairly straightforward. Rather than the block system/grid system of placement, I would have each item just take up the exact amount of space its model does, allowing you to handle and place objects in a lifelike way. You have to actually roll the paint roller, actually swing the sledgehammer, etc. Bonus if you can invite other people over to hang out in your house. Maybe have the TV able to play videos from your computer."
g1f931,Planet haunted house o.O,"I'd love a game similar to planet coaster but instead of building custom coasters you make haunted houses, support for mods and being able to download other people's house. You could have scare zones, i think it'd be hard to capture the same feeling from real haunted houses/events and it wouldn't have the same demographic as something like zoos or coasters although i just think it'd be so fun and spookkyyy."
g1cwzb,"Not a game idea, but an idea for a satire of microtransactions","A game could have ""premium"" currency that in all respects acts like premium currency (can only be obtained very slowly through play or by being bought).\n\nHowever, in the storefront,  all tiers of purchase are free. Players can just constantly purchase the currency over and over again, basically showing how it's just an integer value in your game.\n\nMaybe the currency can be used to buy worthless cosmetics or items with silly effects to drive home the vapidness of it all."
g1ccv0,"A Lego ""Stranger Things"" Game Would Be Awesome","...made by Tt, of course."
g17mst,Game like hitman but involve exploration of the place,"I was wondering if there is a spy game where you have to first observe the surrounding, talk to NPCs, get more information about the area, devise a plan, create/ buy items before carrying out the mission in your own way. If there is I would like to play it. Mission will not only be assassination but it involves gathering information, preventing an event, apprehending villains, impounding goods and etc."
g16qi2,The starving child,"Literally based on a dream I had, I have very little experience with gaming or making games.\n\nThe starved child\n\nA horror game about a child who's been locked in his room for so long by his parents that he literally will eat anything that moves\n\nYou're a small character (you could be a sentient rat, mouse, cockroach or something - I'm not sure what I was in my dream lol) and the aim is to get out of his room without being eaten by him. You can knock things over to distract him, sacrifice other already dead bugs or mice you find to him ect, and the only way he can detect you is by sight or noise so you have to stay quiet and hidden as possible. Kinda like hello neighbour but morbidly depressing.\n\nAnyways that's it lmao."
g166s8,An X-COM style game following an SCP-esque organization,"Pretty simple concept, the player controls a customizable special forces unit as they sneak their way into various complexes and environments, past various rival factions, and capture supernatural creatures or items before sneaking or shooting their way back out. One could make an interesting mechanic out of exploiting an anomalies properties to use against human enemies (so if there was something like 173 that can only move when not within line of sight, one could systemically lure it into the path of an enemy and force them to stay still watching it or dying) and using diversions rather than direct combat, though one could go that route if they’re feeling particularly bold."
g145z1,"Quest compas/screenspace marker, but for a cost","So, ""go here, you dumbass"" system is an expected part of modern open world games, either enabled by default or non configurable at all. So, how about that - next time you'd have to implement this system, make it accesible via consumable item, spell or whatnot else is a fitting way.\n\nThis idea would not fit every game, but if your world is well though out them it could be a good compromise between immersion and convenience."

g0wulj,"A fighting game, but can be easily picked up by inexperienced players.","I came from Smash, and with Ultimate as my first game of the franchise, it's actually astounding how easy the game can be picked up. And then a few months later, I then picked up Mortal Kombat 11, and boy was I button mashing. I'm aware of the beef the Smash and Fighting Game communities have against each other, but hear me out.\n\nWhat if there's a game that's structured like a traditional Fighting Game, say for example Street Fighter, yet controls are easy to pick up. Let me explain.\n\nYou have a character. And the beginner's controls are fairly easy to pick up; A is for an attack, B is for special attacks, inputs like Tilts and Smashes are there, and it can create simple combos. Then, the more complicated attacks are Inputs; there are input variants of the normal B + Direction special moves, which are stronger and have more perks, and there are attacks with are Exclusively inputs; think Smash Ryu or Ken, even Terry if you're feeling that way.\n\nThis idea stemmed from the question ""What if Smash was a traditional Fighting Game"", and that was my suggestion for it. It can be enjoyed by people who just wanna mess around, while also enjoyable for more serious players of Fighting Games."
g0vn22,Furry Themed Game Idea,[deleted]
g0vc0e,A game like Rainbow Six: Siege but in VR,A game where you choose an operator (each with their own  special abilities. Where you either have to defend/protect a room or capture said room. The whole thing would be in VR. There could be modes like in rainbow like a hostage or bomb or even just secure a room. I believe it would be incredibly fun to have a game like this.
g0j3wx,Strategy role-playing game.,"Strategy game, where you are focused not on min-maxing and optimization, but mostly on roleplaying ruler of the state. \n\nI realized that I like to play Civilization or Master of Orion - Stellaris  series as an roleplaying games, making choices not based on optimal, but on my feeling of the spirit of my nation or species. But I got bored fast as my play remains sub-optimal and I can't get to harder levels, and following optimal builds, self-researched or taken from guides, is ruining the experience. \n\nSo, I'm curious, is it possible to make a strategy game that encourages my style of playing?\n\nThat's just a raw idea, but I would like some insights on how to implement it."
g0hwrt,"A systemic stealth game like Hitman, but it's not about assassinations; rather it's about smuggling cargo past layers of high security.","Unlike stealth games, your character isn't trespassing and won't be attacked by security. Your character only has to worry about getting frisked/searched while moving the high value cargo, so you have to find ways of getting it past checkpoints in clever ways. Otherwise, you're a regular VIP in the areas you work."
g0hgty,I need ideas for a very simple game,"The theme is ""enemy is a weapon""\n\n\nHelp me with some easy 2d game ideas."
g0f0f9,Player-defined special moves,"This idea fits any game that includes special abilities like magic or super powers. I personally would love this for an Elder Scrolls-like RPG.\n\nSo, with this concept, upgraded abilities are not selected from a predefined tree.  The player trains a particular element(fire, ice, air, power, electricity, etc) towards a particular body part\n\nTrain the lower body for area attacks and defense(or movement if we're talking air or power abilities). Train the arms for melee attacks. Further training allows for elements to be used through weapons. Even more unlocks ranged attacks.  Precision and power can be factors. Mixing elements can be factors.\n\nCertain elements can even have different benefits/drawbacks based on the player's customized body type. \n\nThe main point is, the player trains towards certain abilities and defines their own special moves based on their prefered fighting style.\n\nJust a random thought. I'm not sure how feasible it would be."
g0eb1o,A MilSim shooter set in the future?,"I have been playing a lot of Squad and Post Scripum lately, and they got me thinking about realism games in general. We keep going farther and farther back, from modern combat, to WW2, to the Civil War, but I've never seen or heard of any of these realism focused titles going into the future.\n\nAll I want is a MilSim shooter* set on some alien planet or moon, but still within the realm of possibility in terms of equipment.\n\nHow long, if ever, will it be before you guys think a game like this will be released? Also, please add ideas onto this, I really want to see what you guys think of it.\n\n\n*For my purposes, a ""MilSim shooter"" is something like Squad, with a realistic 'time to kill' and more authentic tactics and team communication."
g0bg4t,Jack and the Beanstalk - Competitive Asymmetrical Multiplayer in VR,"The classic fairytale as a competitive asymmetrical multiplayer VR video game.\n\nA single VR player would take on the roll of the Giant, while 4-5 other VR players would take on the roll of Adventurers.\n\nThe Giant would be in charge of guarding his modest castle in the clouds. His main goals would be to protect his treasure and to ward off pesky Adventurers invading his home. His score would start high, but would decrease when Adventurers stole treasure from him. He can regain half the value of stolen treasure (and score) by squashing Adventurers holding that treasure. Points could also be gained by squashing Adventurers before they even grab treasure. Utilizing full-body immersion, smooth locomotion, and physically intractable objects, the Giant would be able to hide treasure in cabinets, drawers, chests, and whatnot, and would be able to attack Adventurers by throwing things at them, smashing or swiping them away with a club, picking them up and throwing them, or just walking on top of them. Note: when Adventurers are picked up and thrown, their head and hands are mechanically stabilized, letting it appear from their perspective like it would when you're thrown in a typical flatscreen FPS (no vertical rotation), to minimize motion sickness.\n\nThe Adventurers would work together to steal treasure from the Giant. Their score would start at 0, and would increase by collectively stealing treasure. To ""steal"" treasure, an Adventurer would need to first climb up one of many beanstalks surrounding the castle clouds, infiltrate the castle, grab some treasure, and store it in their backpack. This is all done from an immersive full-body avatar utilizing smooth locomotion and physically intractable objects. Adventurers would be equipped with a backpack for storing treasure, a sword for breaking objects and jabbing the Giant's hands or feet (to force him to drop items, including themselves), a grappling hook used to scale tall furniture, and blanket/cape style paraglider for slowly and safely dropping from great heights. Every time an Adventurer dies, they respawn at the bottom of one of the beanstalks. Note: the beanstalk climb serves an important gameplay component; it gives the Giant time to hide his treasure and locate the beanstalks.\n\nGameplay would seem like a score tug-of-war. Once the Giant or the Adventurers reach double the Giant's initial score, a winner is declared. I felt like the score system would be balanced having multiple Adventurers and just one Giant, but maybe not. I'm open to criticisms and suggestions for improvement on the concept."

g05chj,Harvest Moon/Stardew Valley type game set in Post Apocalypse,"I love classic farming sims like Harvest Moon and love to see it in different scenarios.\n\nIt would take place in a world that has gone through some sort of cataclysm (Nuclear, environmental, alien, maybe even Old God type stuff). Society is mostly dead, there are some scattered people around. I think it have emphasis on working from the ground up on building a village for survivors, and revitalizing the soil so that more types of crops can grow. Baby steps for rebuilding civilization.\n\nSome ideas for content:\n\n\-Braving wastelands for resources and new people\n\n\-Crafting maybe with some chemistry elements (nothing too complicated)\n\n\-Taming wild creatures\n\n\-Crop mutations\n\n\-Finding cures for illnesses\n\n\-Building structures, customizing your village\n\n\-Building relationships with NPCs. Personally, I prefer set NPCs rather than randomly generated ones. So actual characters would need to be fleshed out.\n\n\-Weather stabilization?\n\nI have pretty much no experience in game design. I'm a part-time writer and I've only been putting this together in my head for the past couple days. It's pretty much just for fun. Does this sound like something viable? Is there a game out there that is already this same setting, or is it different enough?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Edit**: I'm thinking that it could start with you're character alone in a small bunker. Either you run out of food or some technical issue. So you could use the bunker as a mini base in the first part of the game, mainly for storage of mats and resting. However, the space is very confined and there's a limit on how much it can be expanded.\n\nI kinda want the cataclysm to be Lovecraftian. Not necessarily pulled directly from the mythos, but more along the lines of ""forces unknown/unknowable"". I suppose Cosmic Horror is the term for it.\n\nThere could be an added story element that you weren't alone when you first went into the bunker, but as a side quest you could try to figure out what happened. I'm a huge fan of ""show don't tell"" exposition.\n\nI haven't actually played Rimworld yet, but what I have in mind has a bit less procedural generation in terms of characters and maybe even overall layout of the world.\n\nI'll add more details as I think of them, but thank you very much for the encouragement guys!"
g04yg7,i need ideas for a game about rain,"by this i mean i want to make a game in which rain has a mechanic that dramatically affects gameplay, such as in [**rain/lost in the rain**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain_(video_game)), where the main mechanic is that **rain makes you visible, but you are otherwise invisible**. The catch is that **this also applies to monsters that are stalking you**. any ideas?"
g034j7,A Fairy-Tale themed Souls-like for more casual players,"The gameplay is Souls-like (Gain experience from slain enemies, have to recover it after you die, limited healing resources replenish able at a checkpoint where you can spend experience on skills, and a hub where you can spend experience like currency with friendly NPCs)\n\nIt takes place in a magical world themes around European mythology and fairy tales, with an emphasis on wonder and beauty rather than the typically oppressive atmosphere of a souls game.\n\nThere are only a few weapon types, and very few unique weapons, instead you have to use different raw materials, blueprints, and magical ores to forge your own. The weapon type affects your attack patterns, the material affects weapon stats and durability, as well as extra damage against different types of enemies, and ores give other abilities, like Fire or Lightning damage to your weapon.\n\nFaeries and Demons take extra damage from Iron, Werebeasts take extra damage from Silver, Steel has the best durability, etc.\n\nFor gameplay, the player and enemies have low HP and a guard gauge that affects their ability to remain poised. While poised, damage is greatly reduced, but a direct attack on the player is almost a death sentence, forcing the player to learn which enemies are best handled at which distances and with which strategies. Since guard regenerates when not attacking or being attacked, the player can afford more mistakes, making the game slightly easier for casual players who like the genre but don't want the punishing difficulty, and the more lighthearted atmosphere will make exploring more enjoyable and less harrowing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWould you play a game like this? Asking Souls fans and Casual gamers alike."
g01852,Building Sim with *INSERT HERE*,"Yo, I made a game prototype, it's a 2D platformer where you can place blocks (like Terraria).\n\nI have no idea what else to add-in to this game prototype, I made the game for the fun of it and didn't plan far ahead.\n\nDoes anybody know what mechanics or things I can add to my game to make it fun and interesting?\n\nP.S. pls don't just say SURVIVAL, your idea can have survival elements but not JUST survival."
fzwgk8,A body horror game where the player slowly turns into a hideous monster as the game progresses,It would be a first-person survival game where the final objective is to find the antidote to your condition.

fzt656,A 300 player Battlefield game,"I'm sitting here baked and I was thinking about MAG for a minute and wondered what if Battlefield decided to up their player count because 64 player is not impressive anymore since modern warfare literally has a game mode that feels like battlefield which is a kick to battlefields head to wake up and get serious about their next game. It should also have immersion like how in red orchestra/rising storm 2 you can hear soldiers screaming and you hearing death sounds is disturbing which is how it should be in my opinion it adds immersion. It would also have roles with sub classes for example, at the spawn screen you can select infantry, air support, or tank role. Selecting infantry will give sub classes like assault, recon, medic, and support. Air support and tank roles will have driver or driver support position. Each of these roles will have their own objectives for example, Air support will have an objective like prevent enemy planes bombing objectives. The tanks role could be to support infantry soldiers who have to capture zones so the team could advance to the next sector. This is just something I thought of right now and even though Post Scriptum or Hell Let Loose exist, It would not compare to what battlefield can do with such a big budget. Destruction would be crazy by having every building being destructible. I mean after all this is next gen right? Could next gen consoles even be capable at handling that much?"

fzrjo9,"Chloe, a fall-out style adventure game set in Australia","Hello\n\nFeel free to add ideas for characters in the comments, as I will leave 99% of this open fore more ideas.  what I provide below is the shell and some stuff on Chloe, the main character.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow this game idea is a fallout and red dead style game with some twists and some little jabs at ideas that people around the world have.  I'll list these below the plot, though I hope you can spot them throughout.  It's fallout and red dead style in how Chloe and the gang venture around the place fighting bad guys in a place destroyed by war, with small pockets of people still existing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst, I'll give the story, which is set in n alternate timeline.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's 2004, and Australia and other Western nations have gotten tired of the U.S.'s starting wars with everyone.  However, as a result of the counter strikes on the U.S., various countries such as the UK, South Africa and New Zealand have been attacked.  The country that has been hit the worst is Australia, with major centers like Sydney being almost whiped off the face of the earth.\n\nHowever, Australia's only hope is a young woman from Manchester, UK, named Chloe Hanson, though she is only known to most people as Chloe.\n\nThe 19 year old is known for having stopped the U.S. from eliminating England, though many don't know how she did it.\n\nCan Chloe save the day with the hel pof her underlings, uncluding a defect from the American forces named Adam Willis?\n\nYou play as Chloe, though many cut scenes appear without Chloe, such as the scene with Hannah Landels and the Capricorn tribe sitting around the camp fire telling stories about the legend of Chloe.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nElements being made fun of:\n\nA major theme being made fun of is the idea that the U.S. is the bad guy.\n\nIn this game, all villains are from the U.S. and all heros save for a select few are non-American.\n\nHot woman saves the world - Chloe is this really hot but kind and caring person.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nElements being played straight:\n\nNerds are awesome - Adam and Chloe are both nerds.\n\nAmerica isn't really evil - Adam's motives for defecting and helping out Chloe is to restore America's reputation in the world.\n\nEnglish women are awesome - Chloe Hanson and her awesomeness.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMisc:\n\nThe encampment Chloe and the others happen upon near the Tropic of Capricorn is called the Capricorn Tribe, who are well known for their stories of harrowing battles, strange creatures and ancient proficies fortelling Chloe's arrival.\n\nThe Capricorn Tribe refers to Chloe as ""The Girl from North of 53"" because Manchester is located at 53° North Latitude\n\nOn this subject, lines of latitude serve as major points for both Chloe's small brigade and the American troops. \n\nThe friendly old woman frmo the Capricorn Tribe that holds out hope for Chloe's arrival is named Hannah Landels, after a friend of mine.\n\nOne of the good Americans that helps Chloe out is named Andrea Jackson, after Andrew Jackson.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout Chloe:\n\nChloe Hanson was born on February 4, 1983 in manchester, England and is of English, Scandinavian, South Caucasian and Persian descent.\n\nChloe had lied about her age during the Amerabritish war of 1999 and as a result, she was able to force more than 150,000 American troops to retreat back to the U.S.  In 2004, she is called to Australia by Andrea Jackson, an American defect who flead the U.S. and is based in the ruins of Sydney to help bring hope to Australia after it was destroyed after resisting American forces.  There, Chloe met up with Adam, another American defect who's main goal is to restore America's reputation is a force of good and destroy the carrupt American forces and the powers tha tare carrupting the American military.\n\nChloe is a skilled ATV driver, horseman, and camel rider,  and she is also a skilled fighter with guns, swords and bows and    arrows.  She has also won the war of Arazona, freeing one of the few good U.S. states from the clutches of the carrupt government in America's new capital in New York City.  She must use all her skills and pick u pmore to help Australia gain back their territory and bring the carrupt American power to justice to free both the world and the remaining good Americans.  Can she do it?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow remember, I'mnot saying America is bad, but rather this game's use of the Americans as being the bad guys and the cause of the destruction of Australia, South Africa and the others is meant to make fun of the idea that America is the cause of all the world's problems.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do you think?"
fzr5rr,I’m trying to make an open world game with a military theme to it. (kinda like gtao but actually well planed),"I’m in the beginning stages and am trying to get unique but iconic and useful vehicles and weapon ideas. So far I’m looking for ww2 vehicles like halftracks, jeeps, U boats, aircraft carriers and biplanes. It’s set in modern day but the player will be able to buy relics as the military would in reality not sell the new technology so the player must use iconic vehicles that you could actually buy from a military museum or auction. Any and all ideas are welcome at this stage. Thank you for your assistance."
fzql70,"Initial idea, need to flesh it out: stealth roguelike where everything is pitch dark and you use enemies to guide yourself","Tile based, turn based\n\nYou can't see anything.\n\nWhen you move you hear your footsteps which is a sign that you actually moved and are not blocked. But you don't know where you really are.\n\nWhen you pass close to an enemy, a symbol (a question mark?) shows up above him representing he heard something, and you can see the symbol, so you know where the enemy is, and you have a guide that you're somewhere close.\n\nIf you want to ""see"" where you are you can choose to move making a loud noise and a ""stomp!"" sign appears where you are. But when you move like that enemies farther away can hear you, and enemies can move two tiles in the turn instead of just one.\n\nWhen enemies move you do ""see"" them for a short period: you see two shoes where they are that vanish after a second or two.\nKnowing the position of enemies when they move, and ""knowing"" where you are by stomping or by walking past an enemy and seeing the ""?"" above it, you have to guide your character across the level, evading the enemies.\nI guess you could place traps so as to trick enemies to fall into them."
fzpdt5,A car mechanic/ repair shop idle clicker.,"So this might not be the most original idea, or something that most people will be fond of, since it's a clicker. But I haven't found any idle clicker games with a car mechanic theme.\n\nI was thinking the player would start of with a small shop, upgrade his equipment to level up and therefore be able to service expensive cars.\n\nLet me know what you guys think, I'm just asking around opinions before I actually start making the game.

fzja9q,Stuntman Simulator,"You take on the role of a stuntman for a movie studio\n\nThe scenes you take on start from simple chase and window jumps, fighting, parkour, and start escalating to life risking stunts like explosive kick offs, burning, getting hit by vehicles and high speed chases\n\n*Score system*:\n\nYou're graded on how quickly you can do a scene, whether or not you fumble your attempt (tripping, breaking props, missing your target, etc.), how stylish you look while doing it, and if the studio has to reshoot the scene (failing, taking too long, breaking the equipment, etc.)\n\nThere's also hidden bonus stunts or props you can use for the scene to get improv points.\n\nThe game ends with you training your stuntdouble for the movie about your career"
fzfygt,Rogue Like Tactical RPG,"A procedurally generated set of maps (like 10-20 per playthrough) here you can recruit new members to your team on each map. Each boss also drops some loot that can help bolster your army. All maps, enemies, and potential allies are randomly generated each game.

Preferably not a JRPG.\n\nI already want to include LISA, Jimmy and the Pulsating Mass, Pizza Tower, and Bug Fables, but 3 of them are RPG's. I want more ideas."
fzelq3,A game set in the Star wars universe where you are the commander of a stardestroyer etc.,Lets be honest everyone who likes star wars likes the big space battle .But there has never been a game where you are the commander of a big ship.\n\nIt could be set in all 3 timlines(Prequel;Sequel;Original).  Have a Focus tree for each Faction and Timline. \n\nFactions could play diffrent for example Rebels having fast mobile ships while the Empire has slow but good armored ships.\n\nA good exisisting example would be World of Warships but just set in Space without Pay2Win.
fza54z,Spore but better,"So like spore without the aliens and different genre segments. Just think it would be cool if there was a game that was trying to imitate the animal kingdom, maybe even online and pvp. Would probably have to be AAA to be good, but imagine if you could be a big cat and roam the jungle, stealthily hunting and upgrading from what you kill a la spore. \n\nCould have dynamic free running that would change depending what you went, ape, cat, small lizard or something. I was just thinking why do we always look outwards for cool shit when it’s right here. Thought about birds too which would be cool if you could fly but would probably be too easy to avoid other creatures unless you had stamina of some sort, but let’s be honest you’d want to fly forever. \n\nOnline would be cool because then it would be a sort of clan type thing where presumably you’d be grouped with other animals like you, or go solo, why not it’s just an idea. \n\nJust think a game like this would be super fucking cool. Even wondered if it would be possible to scale the world to what animal you were. So say you went a tiger or something, the scale would be approximately what we would experience as humans. But say you went a mouse, then it would be awesome if everything was from that perspective. Like, other players would be massive, the level would be 10 times bigger. Have no idea if that is possible tbh. I suppose the big issue would be combat, like how would a tiger fight a mouse? I suppose it couldn’t, but then I suppose it never would to begin with. Would have to be a sort of predator/prey system where one gets bonuses for escape, the other for the catch. That’s why I think the free running would be super vital. That would have to be very fun in itself. \n\nI think you can see where I’m going with this. Sorry for being a bit rant-y. Let my know if you like my idea that will never be"
fz8gub,Avatar hack and slash,it would follow the story of avatar and you would play as aang unlocking different elements and attacks over the course of the game.
fz6rir,Game for car lovers,"[sorry for any formatting and spelling errors on mobile] so I am really into cars and games with big economy systems and role playing elements, I was thinking that a game kind of like gta online in the sense that it is open world, multilayer and has a huge selection of vehicles and properties.  So having an open world game with real cars that are highly customisable (to the point of each individual part) and having it as a kinda of car mechanic simulator. Having garages purchasable and fully customisable with workshops and stuff, having online car marketplaces where players can buy cars from eachother etc with custom paint jobs custom parts and things, to earn money having street races, proper like f1 racing and maybe also implementing motorbikes and stuff, Also having jumps and other fun things to do,, having clubs and car shows, and being fully compatible with those steering wheel sets you can buy for your pc/console.  Sorry for the brain sore you just read, I am partially dyslexic.  But message me if you want me to explain this in more detail I am working on making an in-depth explanation of my idea, probs won't ever be made but it would be really fun to see and I could see it as something a lot of people would love"
fz3hqb,John Wick FPS made by Id Software,Just a quick shower thought after playing through Doom Eternal. What if they placed it pace wise somewhere between the newer Wolfensteins and Doom? You could have modified glory kills as Wick’s gun kata or whatever and otherwise have satisfying gunplay. Not a super serious idea but i thought it would be fun.
fz2dvb,A Satisfying Green Lantern Game - The Lantern Experience,"So I've been thinking about how a Green Lantern game could work and I think I've got something worth sharing.\n\nImagine a Green Lantern game where every button and combination do something different. Light attacks, continuous attacks, AOE attacks, shields, constriction attacks and so on. None of these attacks have any default look. Instead, they'll be constructs created by the developers and the community.\n\nThe players would be connected to a shared multiplayer (kind of like Death Stranding) where they will share a database of constructs created by users. That way, whenever the player uses an attack or a move, the appearance would change. \n\nI'm thinking the game should have a Construct Workshop where players create a construct and link it to one of the buttons or attack types. I'm imagining a tool that's simple to use with a lot of depth. You could have people create all sorts of constructs ranging from simple objects to full on Kaiju or freighters or robots. The possibilities would be quite literally endless.\n\nI also imagine there should be some sort of immediate like/dislike button so that players can avoid certain people's creations or creations they deem... strange or have more creations from talented people. Undoubtedly, there would be a lot of immature stuff.\n\nIt would also allow people to create constructs without having to do anything prior and they could even become excited about what their next attack will look like. After a few hours of playing and telling the game what types of constructs they like, they would start getting constructs that suit their tastes.\n\nThere's just something about having a game about Green Lanterns which would use the community's creativity to grow."
fz10uq,Some idea for my first game in unity :D,
fz0jlo,"Since Erutika has too many MegaMan mechanics, what are your suggestions in adjusting her?","I was asking for suggestions in the comments of my last thread, but nobody responded. If you’re able to find it, if you wanna respond to the comments I made, be my guest.\n\nNow I would like to point out one thing. I do like MegaMan X’s wall jump system over any other platformer I’ve played. It’s incredibly flexible and I don’t have to worry about only jumping to the other side of the wall like in Mario or platformers that have a similar wall jump system. So this choice is based off of my personal tastes.\n\nNow I did have a few ideas. I have a jump slash for her, and I can do is John Wick her by making her mix grappling moves with her pistol. I also have the thought of her stealing from enemies, even though most of the enemies she, Kaji, and a bunch of other characters in the party are going to be fighting demons.\n\nAside from that, what would you suggest me to do?"
fyy80o,What ideas for a game I can create on StruckD? (Its a game maker app),
fywwbc,Thoughts on idea: Retro-steampunk vs nature; an exploration game,"CONCEPT: On an island country lay three cities; contained and surrounded by wildlife.  Not many live outside of the ""safety zone"", but those of old still believe  in coexistence with the world around them. One such people are ""you"" and your remaining family.\n\nGame mechanics:\n   -Cam view: switchable from first to third person.\n   \n-Locomotion movement\n   \n-Day &amp; Night cycle \n   \n-Cooking &amp; crafting: turning ingredients  into separate items, then merge them to get the finished product.  ex.(Swiss-style juice recipe= any fruit + purified water)\n   \n -Tame: by calming and feeding certain beasts gives the player ownership of said beast.\n\nConclude: The idea is similar to how Subnautica was portrayed.  You; the player, is forced to explore in a dangerous environment in hopes of survival. \n\nA story can be placed after all the mechanics and assets are done. \n\nThe game doesn't need to be so enormous, just playable.  \n‐------‐---------------------‐----------------------------------\n\nPlease let me know what you think about this idea and; if possible, improve it.\n\n~Thank you for your time!"
fyuuxn,Animal Crossing but with light RPG and dungeon crawler mechanics in a fantasy setting,"You're the king or queen of a small kingdom surrounded by a dark forest littered with endless dungeons that are filled with monsters. Every day you venture forth to find blueprints and parts for new buildings and decorations, castle upgrades, crafting mats, and armors and weapons. You rescue villagers and make them into your loyal subjects, building amenities for them and carrying out daily quests to gain their favor. As time goes on, you forge a bustling kingdom filled with loyal subjects for you to reign over from your castle.\n\nThe main gameplay loop is running procedurally-generated dungeons to complete quests and obtain resources to improve your kingdom. It's one part Animal Crossing, one part single player MMO, with daily quests and tasks to perform in an open-ended, casual town builder.\n\n#Details\n\n* You start in a small clearing in the middle of a large forest. As time goes on you construct buildings, replacing the forest with a town, and gaining villagers either from rescuing them from dungeons or attracting them to your town through progression.\n\n* Game time is based on a 24 hour clock, meaning it's night in the game when it's night for you. Different types of monsters or resources might only appear at certain times of day or in certain seasons.\n\n* Daily dungeons are procedurally-generated maps that come in a number of different types/tilesets/layouts: crypts, caves, forests, ruins, etc. Different types of monsters from each type of dungeon drop different items, so you'll have an idea of which type you'll need to visit to accomplish different tasks within your kingdom.\n\n* The number of dungeons you can visit per day is limited by resources so that you can't just grind out everything in one marathon session. You need supplies to go on adventures, but you can only create a certain amount of them at a time based on finite resources that regenerate daily.\n\n* Daily quests and procedurally-generated quests -- your villagers occasionally give you one-time quests for tasks they need you to perform, usually by going to a dungeon to kill a named monster, to get items, or to craft something for them. There are also daily quests required to reach certain goals in the game such as gaining reputation.\n\n* Combat -- casual hack-and-slash, nothing too complicated or hardcore like Diablo or PoE. There are no parts of the game where you'll get blindsided by a powerful boss that one-shots you or overwhelmed by dozens of mobs. If you do die, you get resurrected back in your kingdom and lose the items you collected on that run, but you can go back to that dungeon and collect them again, so all you're losing is time.\n\n* Open class system -- level up and choose any skill you want, but the build you choose is more based on fun and your own preference. Min-maxing is unnecessary since every build is viable (although not necessarily optimal or efficient). You can unlearn skills at any time by spending items or currency.\n\n* Itemization -- small bonuses such as +2 damage for a weapon, but with aesthetics also being a large consideration. There are many collectible armor sets and weapons.\n\n* Progression -- in addition to to the procedurally generated daily dungeons that automatically scale to your level, there are also one-time challenge dungeons that unlock as you progress. These are guarded by custom-designed bosses that are mildly challenging (you can't just spam them to death, you have to use some sort of stratefy). These drop loot as well as some kind of exclusive upgrade that's important to the development of your kindgom (not yet sure exactly what).\n\n* The graphical style and general aesthetic -- cartoonish. Could be 3D like Animal Crossing, but it could also work with Stardew Valley/Moonlighter-style 2D graphics.\n\n* Outside of the RPG aspects, it has what you'd expect out of Animal Crossing when it comes to interactions with your villagers, life simulation, and kingdom management. E.g. maybe you could get married and choose a king or queen consort from among the villagers. Obviously a lot of your interactions would be tied into the items and materials you bring back from dungeons.\n\n#Lore\n\nIn contrast to the cartoonish aesthetic and casual game design, the lore is really dark.\n\nThe entire world has been taken over by an endless, unnatural forest that has over-grown and destroyed everything, with all of humanity enslaved and imprisoned in dungeons. The remains of the old world (the crypts, castles, towns, etc.) are all now run-down ruins that have been taken over by monsters. The dead have been resurrected as zombies and skeletons, guarding their burial places as restless undead; the animals have been corrupted and twisted into vicious, dire versions of themselves; nightmarish monsters such as orcs and goblins have been made animate by the dark rituals of the Unmentionable One to be used as his foot soldiers.\n\nThe Unmentionable One, who is responsible for this entire catastrophe, also cast a spell that made him immortal, but it was actually blood magic that also inadvertently enchanted a few other humans as well, including you. Just like him, you can be resurrected on an altar after you die, making you into essentially a god-king. As you beat back the forest and your kingdom expands outward, you create a growing sanctuary where monsters fear to tread because their life energy is bound to the evil magic of the forest. You alone can battle the forces of evil and forge a new kingdom where mankind can live in peace."
fyszre,I have been working on this in my mind but I am not a coder.,I really like weather and I wish there was a game where you could play as a storm where your goal was to become the strongest storm on the map and eat up all other storms. Kinda like a weather battle royale. You could view every type of radar and satellite to view your storm. You could get points by causing damage which would be added to your account and these points would be used to show you on a leaderboard. You would pick what kind of weak storm you want to start as but you can get stronger and evolve into a fully fledged multi precipitation storm system or even a hurricane. You would also have the threat of being killed off by surrounding weather systems and patterns. Because you are playing as a storm system you cannot directly control your player but can only control things like very slight direction movements or what kind of weather to make happen in an area of your storm but on a time limit where it will happen by itself or you will lose the opportunity. These choices will also only last a determined amount of time because of surrounding conditions. Another thing is you can choose where you start but you have to start in an area where your storm type has the conditions to form. I could go on and on but if I come up with anything else I will post them in the comments. I really want this game to exist.
fyrqqk,Game idea..!,"This is just a food for thought idea that I’ve come up with, so basically this would be a game that plays like The godfather or gta, in which your in an open world thats run by gangs/mafia families/cartel and you start off on the bottom of the totem pole, you start off as a low level gangster and do basic criminal activities until you reach a point where your a more experienced criminal and so on and so forth until you are able to either start a criminal enterprise or lead the one you started in, make different choices that can change how the game ends off at and play at the top of the criminal enterprises or end up dead or in prison.\n\nThis is just food for thought and i plan on going more into details such as storyline and other aspects at a later point, also sorry for format, I’m on mobile."

fyq7bc,Idea: A Pirate Game set in the Underworld (Hades),"Lightly inspired by the Greek myth of Charon, the ferryman. And also by the fact that we've Never had a good PIRATE-THEMED Single player RPG \n\nYou play as an undead Pirate, living in the underworld, with your own ""Charon-boat"" used to ferry souls into the Afterlife,atop the ever changing lake filled with monsters and mystery. \n\nBasic Gameplay loop is to look for souls, capture them into your boat and sail to the gates of the underworld. Souls can also be rescued and turned into your crewmen. Souls can be found stranded on islands, captured by other pirates or even morphed into monsters. \n\nThe idea is that ferrying souls grants the boat owner all their abandoned riches. Based on how they lived, each soil can add buffs to you, your ship and your crew. It can also affect the rewards given by ferrying them to the Gates of Hades. \n\nYou can rob other boats, fight off monsters from the lake or explore the many islands that populate the underworld."
fyq0ki,You must restore a research station on the moon to escape back to Earth,"This is a game I'm making currently (hope that's allowed)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou landed on the moon, but during your flight your ship was damaged by space debris. Your fuel reserves are drained and the ship needs heavy repairs to be operable again. Thankfully, you managed to land right near a research station. Normally the lights will be on and people will be moving on the other side of the glass, but it doesn't seem that way. You call for anyone on your radio but only hear silence.\n\nUpon entering the base, you notice that there is no air. What happened here?\n\nThe gameplay goes like this. The player walks on to a cargo lift that descends into a large crater. You then walk over to the research station and notice there isn't any power in the airlocks. You search for a crowbar and pry open the airlock, and explore the base. You finally walk into a power room and get the instructions to turn on the power, you complete said objectives, and explore further. \n\nYou will then walk upon an engineering bay put there for repairs. You must scavenge for materials around the base and take surface samples of the moon to get the resources for repairing your lander. When all of this is done, you launch into orbit to re-dock and repair the rest of the ship.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe story is found through text logs which reveals what happened to the crew. What do you guys think of my idea?"
fyovu2,Coronavirus/Virus Avoid Cough and getting infected Game,"A simple game where you (curser) avoid moving obstacles but with a twist and related to coronavirus. Curser represents you, other moving 'dots' represents potential carriers, and there can be an element where random person 'coughs' leaving a short duration 'mist' you must also avoid. \n\nDifferent scenarios could be an idea? Social distancing vs not; and to different degrees. \n\n'Cough mist' could infect any other random dot that passes area within that duration and become infected= increasing difficulty of game."
fyhj0z,Looter-shooter: DC Villains/Antiheroes,"Hey guys I’m new here so please let me know if I’m doing something wrong.\n\nThis is kind of a dream idea, being a looter-shooter, but I am just a big DC fan and I’m also a fan of looter-shooters like the Borderlands, Fallout and Destiny series. So I drew inspiration from these, plus from the GTA V camera-modes.\n\nI would love to one day see a looter-shooter with DC characters that use guns. My ideas were Red Hood, Harley Quinn, Deathstroke, Captain Cold, Deadshot, and Joker. We’ve played them all in the Injustice &amp; Arkham series, and I think it could be made into a game like the ones I mentioned.\n\nOne big thing that came to mind was the special skills of each character, somewhat correlated to their stories. For instance, Red Hood was resurrected from the Lazarus Pit, then he meets Joker who killed him and tries to revenge-kill but gets held back (by Talia or something, whoever is organizing them). So his special skill would be similar to his on IJ2 and Salvador’s in BL2, where he gains some bloodlust and goes out with two electrically charged guns of the same type and can also hit enemies with them. Or something like that.\n\nSimilarly, Harley Quinn could go on a rampage with her bat or mallet. Deathstroke with either his classic sword or two shorter katanas. The Joker with a bunch of grenades. Deadshot with massively-increased headshot damage. Cold with his Cold Gun &amp; some cryo grenades of the sort.\n\nMain feature that I had in mind though was being able to play each character in first- and third-person, similar to GTA V. We have done so in the Arkham series, but these were short DLCs and I wanted to play these guys more."
fyh6ta,Let's work together for a Collaborative Game Project," \n\nHey Folks,\n\nSince long time I have been thinking about creating a 2D platform game.I have got the rough idea of the game and its storyline. I want to find out if we can get along to create something great together. I'm looking for aspiring game developers who can come work along with me.  \n\nI have been learning Unity Engine and C# for quite some time so I will definitely contribute to the project along with you all.\n\nNow coming on the plot of the game:\n\nI'll try to explain it simply. This game would be similar as that of the game Limbo but more physics based.\n\n\*Game starts on the deserted island and main character is a scientist who was working on a research project and now everything is destroyed and he is left with no other option but to leave the island and reach the mainland.\n\n\*Basically the game journey would be divided into 3 parts that are:\n\n1. To reach the seashore at the edge of island through various hurdles.\n\n2. From island to the seashore at the mainland by surfing through the sea using self-made boat .\n\n3. After reaching the seashore , he has to climb up the mountain and reach the cliff. Once he has reached the cliff he can see the beautiful city that lies at the bottom of the valley. Only way he can reach the city is by flying through the air either by gliding or self made parachute.\n\n\* Throughout the journey character will be provided with the natural resources such as ropes,wooden log, etc which he can carry along the journey but the twist is his carrying capacity is limited and each resource has it’s own benefits for example if the user is carrying wooden board with him and after he has reached the cliff he can use this wood for fire to warm him up as it’s of no use in flying.\n\n\* The main theme of the game is that you have to experience all three modes of transport i.e water, air &amp; land and resources that can be used in one aspect may or may not be useful in others.\n\n\* The player has to play very attentive and strategic to proceed successively in the game.\n\nIf you are interested and want to take opportunity of making this game a reality , you are most welcome.\n\nNow talking about the execution of the project\n\n\* All game files will be hosted on some platform so anyone can check the game any time and submit any changes if he feels.\n\n\* The project will be divided into sub parts and different teams will be working on each aspect of the game and it’s completely upto the developer to choose any .\n\n\* As of now this will be a non-profit organisation so it will be a non-profitable contribution from your side.\n\nThe project will be using the Unity game engine or Godot if majority agrees to go with it.  \n\nIf you are interested in this idea kindly join the discord server below so that we can discuss about more details\n\n[https://discord.gg/HwQ9xRx](https://discord.gg/HwQ9xRx)"
fyfzx0,"How about a fantasy dungeon crawler, but without swords?","I'm pretty new here, so I'll just give a simple idea for someone to work with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe idea is that, at the beginning of the game, you can choose a weapon out of many different ones to go through the same dungeon with. The catch is, no swords, as swords tend to be the most overused weapons in fantasy and the most all around, and the challenge here is to have your players try to figure out the optimal play for a new weapon. The other challenge would be figuring out how to differentiate the weapons you have gameplay wise from swords or the other weapons. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe weapons I was thinking about were:\n\nDagger: Very short ranged, doesn't do much damage, but is quite fast. It could be replaced with gauntlets for similar effect, and does less damage to armored enemies. Does Piercing damage.\n\nAxe: The slowest and most lumbering weapon, with very wide swings and a lot of lag, but does a lot of damage and hits armor hard. Worse vs single targets but is decent crowd control. Does Piercing and blunt damage.\n\nSpear: Decent speed and the longest, non projectile range. Good at keeping monsters off you, as it has pretty good knockback, but once the mob is on you, its hard to get them off. Not a crazy amount of damage either. Does Piercing Damage\n\nBoat Oar: A bit more unconventional weapon, but it has decent range and decent hitstun, but doesn't do much damage. Does Blunt damage and is probably the best crowd control option out of these.\n\nMace: Hits very hard and does very well against armored opponents, but is short ranged and rather slow, and is very poor at crowd control. Does blunt damage.\n\nHandgonne: A very early gun, it hits hard and is ranged, but takes time to reload. Does piercing damage and hits all foes in a straight line, but is still difficult to crowd control. You can hit stuff melee with it like a stick, but its by far the weakest out of these without shooting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTheres a lot of other weapons you could choosing, I just thought these 6 were interesting and could lead to some well rounded gameplay. There are still other possible weapons, like hammers, whips, polearms, pikes, Picks, Shovels, War Clubs, Bows, javelins, and shields that can be tried out. Heres a good list for them:  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_premodern\_combat\_weapons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_premodern_combat_weapons)"

Visual and design could be similar to Firewatch, or Metro Exodus which makes the game immersive. \n\nGameplay: \n\n(Mission)\n\nThere will be missions which you can approach in various different ways similar to Hitman. Different to Hitman, most of the mission does not involve assassination but involve other things such as gathering information, preventing an event, apprehending villains, impounding goods and etc. Missions will be timed based and assessed.\n\n(Mechanics)\n\nLike Metro Exodus, the character will make no dialog. For checklist, the player will have to open  the phone which will be marked by your assessor after you have done it. As you are a spy, you will be living in trailer car and to save the game you will have to go back to your trailer, (which will show you a cut scene of the player putting cloths in laundry and getting into shower.) \n\n1.Clothings:\n\nClothes for the mission can be ordered online and well as things you need for the mission. Clothes can only be worn a day which will then be put in laundry for three days so the player have to think carefully before going on a mission. \n\n2.Food:\n\nThe player will have to eat also to be energised for the mission. They could be cooked in the trailer or bought online.\n\n3.accessories\n\nAccessories can be bought online or they can be crafted in trailer. \n\n(Failing mission)\n\nWhen you fail a mission, you will wake up back in your trailer.\n\nSize:\n\nDoes not need to be open world like aforementioned games as you will only be spending time in trailer car, going to mission and doing jobs.\n\nHow do you think about this share your idea"

fxq8b0,A system combing health and stamina,"So, this system is based on Dark Souls stamina system.\nLet me explain.\n\nYou do not have a Health bar. You only have an Energy bar. When attacking, you are depleting your energy bar. The longer you keep attacking (the lower the bar) the higher is your attack damage. But once the bar is fully depleted, you die.\n\nWhen resting (not doing any actions) the bar refills itself just like Dark Souls Stamina bar. Dodging does not take away any of your Energy. A perfect dodge (dodging last second) will boost your refill for a few seconds.\n\nGetting hit also takes away your Energy bar. However blocking will slow down your rate of regeneration. When getting hit while blocking, your Energy does not deplete, however the regeneration stops per hit you tank a few seconds.\n\nThis system is a high risk high reward one. The lower you get, the more damage you do, but you're easier to get killed and you also have to pay attention to how much Energy you still have."
fxq7ra,Red Dawn inspired open map game,"I was thinking about my perfect game and I boiled it down to this. \n\nThere should be options for different starts. For example, a brief history of the player, current occupation, and current living situation and what weapons they have in their home. These would be basic things. \n\nPersonally my start would be: male, living in the suburbs. Currently unemployed student. I have some small arms in the house including pistol, rifle, shotgun. Another person might be female, living in a rural area (farm maybe), currently \nemployed in an office. She has a pistol in her house. \n\nMore examples of start options appearance/ sex. Occupation would need to be generic: student, office worker, police, fire, athlete, retired, construction, stripper etc. Living situation would need to be similarly generic: suburban house, rural, apartment, condo. City/ rural/ suburbs. Weapons in the house would need to be common such as rifle (hunting/ sporting), pistol, shotgun. Small stock of ammunition. \n\nThe map would have to be extremely large but also accommodate for all of the different living environments. All of these different types of starts should have some distance between each other and be different as they would be in real life, I’m thinking something like RDR2 or ghost recon wild lands. \n\nGame play would need to very immersive. I like how in RDR2 traveling is sort of a chore similar to real life. This also make the game feel more high stakes since it takes forever to get somewhere. In the movie red dawn I remember most electronics being knocked out in the beginning and there being an invasion. The player should be going about their day early in the game and then chaos ensues. Most electronics and communications go down and thy have to pack a few things and escape. They survive until they find a group of rebels in the wilderness to join up with and fight back. There should be an open map style story line/ campaign with several side quests. I like the idea of “the fence” in RDR2 being able to sell stolen things but the player shook also be able to trade for better stolen equipment. I like the idea of a home base in RDR2 also where the player can keep things they either buy, steal, or need to store. \n\nThis game should have a bit of an apocalypse feel to it but also have modern amenities that would be commonly allowed by the invaders “hearts and minds” campaign. RDR2 is a great format but more modern and with weapons both from civilian hands/ gun shops/ red necks/ and military.  Red Dawn style."
fxop5q,"Two Games one idea, 1st: A town/city building survival game which leads into 2nd: a chill ruins exploration game.","So this comes from my enjoyment of exploration games where you stumble upon ruins and learn the story from the environment and books and anecdotes from weary old men. A prime example is I enjoyed greatly in Breath of the Wild just wandering around and stumbling upon some ruined little town nestled in the snowy hills, or finding a lake and seeing the ruins of a city at the bottom. But the issue there was nothing came from those ruins, I can guess what happened but they were designed AS ruins from the developers perspective. They were just locations for the collectables to be found or enemies to spawn.\n\nI also enjoyed the idea that Bossa Studios had with Worlds Adrift until they killed it off for biting off more than they can chew. They had two games, a ""island creator"" where the community designed and built floating islands using premade assets and voxel shaping tools, which were then inserted into the main game for people to stumble upon. \n\nSo my idea is twofold. As the title says the first half is a building game much like all those early access survival games you see, but a bit less...samey, more vibrant and closer to minecraft in how colourful it is. You and friends build up a town or city, which gets attack by enemies (or other players, tho I'm kinda sick of the PVP these kinds of games have which just end up as horrid gank fests for the largest groups and griefers). \n\nNow these towns will be populated by NPC's, and using another example I enjoyed how Dragon Quest Builders 2 did their townspeople and honestly the biggest limitation with that game is..the fact it has limitations (you can only build 100 ""rooms"" and have 64 Villagers on your island total). But each villager spawned with a roll, and they would fulfill it so farmers actually farmed (they would harvest, plant seeds, water), smiths..smithed, dancers danced on stage in saloons while the bartender slung drinks. \n\nSo you and/or friends build up a neat town, using premade assets in various styles so it could be a little village made of wooden cabins, a bustling desert city made of sandstone, a fortress citadel etc. Hostile elements would constantly be a threat and would as your town leveled up become stronger and more fearsome. There would be a variety of forms of ways your town could come under attack. Invading armies, diseases, monsters, natural disasters. Eventually your town would fall. I'm sure clever gamers would invent someway to last indefinitely but EVENTUALLY most players towns/cities would fall. Thus we head into the second game. \n\nAs noted I enjoyed Worlds Adrifts concept of just floating around on your self-made airship, finding little islands people made to be explored. So I would want to take that but not have it bogged down by the fact it was a MMO. From the first game these cities and towns are saved to a archive list and depending on how they fell are modified into ruins. During the first games playthrough players can make little journal logs and the game automatically logs significant events. This data is used in recreating these ruins as locations to explore in the second game, giving each ruined town, city, camp whatever they built a story.\n\nI think learning about a location and getting story from it is an excellent reward for exploring an area, and to many developers are hung up on giving the player something to collect or be tangible. Now these ruins WOULD have stuff to collect, maybe some weapons or gear or resources used by the people who made it. But this second game would be a soft survival game. You on a ship or some sort, airship preferably but it could be by boat or landship, something you can build and upgrade, you sail around an ""infinite"" world where you just stumble upon these cities and explore them, meet random NPC survivors who have stories about the places, find their secrets and stories and move onto the next one. They would all be among a ever changing world, which is why its preferable to travel by airship/boats as all these towns and cities can be on small landmasses themselves and be loaded out and in as needed. \n\nEach place would have its own seed you could enter into a navigational system which would steer you back to it through the mists or over the horizon. If you don't save the seed to that island or recall it, it'll be lost to the void to you unless you by chance happen upon it again. The game would track if you have visited it before, so that if you do revisit those ruins or find it by chance it won't magically have reset. \n\nBy using the first game to seed locations for the second, you can get around the repetitiveness of exploration you get in games like minecraft, with every location having its own little story, getting around the flaws of procedurally generating worlds. By having each location it's own little seeded ruin it gets around the flaw that led to Worlds Adrift dying in that it won't need the running costs of a MMO server, and won't have the performance issues of a mmo server as each person is in their own game and the ruins are pulled from a database and then deleted once left. Sail far enough away from an island, you lose it, you can't just turn around and find it again. \n\nEssentially the first game is a taking the building of survival games and isolating it to the size of a island, islands can be of varying size but still and island. You build your own LITTLE society on this island (maybe with some friends)and defend it from aggressors (maybe other people). Eventually your town will fall and it transfers to a database which transforms it into ruin.\n\nthen\n\nEssentially the second game is you (and some friends) and exploring a ""endless"" expanse of oceans or clouds or deserts or generated basic terrain ala minecraft style, on a ship of some kind and the game loads in these island sized ruins, maybe on actual islands, maybe spawned into a biome that matched their theme. You get to explore these ruins, learn their history from when they were functioning in the first game, get some neat story, some items to upgrade your vessel, fight off some enemies but mostly you just explore. You can log the co-ordinates of this ruin if you want to revisit it, but once you leave it disappears from your game. This isn't minecraft where its generating and keeping the world, the world itself is ephemeral, simply a means of passage between these ruins. \n\nBoth create the illusion of a bigger world when it's all really contained. The end goal is to create a game where building up your town has a purpose beyond simply creating it, and to create a second game where exploration is actually rewarding in that you learn stories and are rewarded with adventure instead of shiny trinkets or loot."
fxnuan,"Fallout+State Of Decay+Animal Crossing+Happy Tree Friends, an idea that came to me as I was watching a movie","Walls of text here\n\n*Lore*: Three hundred years ago, a nuclear war ravaged the Earth, nothing new. \n\nYou, the player character, are an AI designed to operate incredibly advanced systems, your task before the bombs dropped was to monitor a gene therapy lab that experimented on animals.\n\nThe experiment was, mostly, successful after the first 150 years as the creatures, due to lack of a human overseer, evolved and became a race of adorable, dimwitted, human-animal hybrids. (pretty sure that wasn't the point of the experiment)\n\nAs the next century passed and the creatures developed their own society, a rather peaceful if dumb one, you tended to them and they began to worship you as a deity, much to your chargin.\n\nFor the last 50 years you were dormant as they grew, until you received a radio transmission from the terraformer project meant to recreate the continent, which you didn't really feel the need to go to since you believed humanity was extinct.\n\nTurns out they weren't, they were just on ice, and because of your most basic programming you have no choice but to go to the terraformer and recreate the continent; one problem though, you have no means of transporting yourself as any and all artificial bodies have long since withered away.\n\nYour only choice is to get the little creatures to take you all the way to the terraformer, which is all the way across the continent; and this is where the game begins.\n\n*Gameplay*\n\nBase building/management:\nAs you journey out into the wastes, you'll need to stake your claim in the wastes in order to survive and continue your mission\n\nOnce you have a base established, you have plenty of freedom as to how it's set up, and must maintain all of its functions, keep morale up and ensure it can be defended\n\nScavenging/Combat:\nScavenging is like State of decay's with a mix of Fallout, certain fixed resources combined with some RNG dependent on stats.\n\nCombat is also like State of decay's, third person melee and shooting combat (optional first person)\n\n\nDay/Night cycle:\n\nDuring the day, you send the little ones into the savage wastes to scavenge for supplies/weapons/armor ala Fallout Shelter, but you have the option of doing it manually.\n\nDuring the night you take control of the little ones as they defend their current home\n\nTravel:\nYou have to rest at each base in order to collect enough resources to ensure they can survive the journey, after reaching the quota you can travel\n\n\n*The Little Ones*:\nThe little ones are the results of the lab experiment, they are a race of human-animal hybrids, that range from woodland creatures to bats and other kinds of mammals, who have had no real contact with the outside world, they never really needed to, and are very ill prepared for what awaits them.\n\nThe Animal Crossing/Happy Tree Friends bit, comes from the fact that they're adorable\n\nTurns out their flesh is very tasty to the other creatures in the wasteland\n\nYou must train them to survive the wastes in order to complete your mission and ensure that the experiment (them) does not fail either\n\nTheir appearances, species, and names are all randomly generated with a select few being truly unique.\n\nCustomization:\nYou can find and craft all kinds of stuff for them to where around the base or in the wastes\n\nClasses:\nCombat roles for the little ones in the wastes and can have effects for the base\n\nWarriors: self explanatory, they are the defenders, all of their perks are combat only, they excel with melee weapons and heavy guns\n\nEngineer: they are the builders, they increase construction/descriptions speeds and in the wastes they can disable traps and build weapons, they excel with shotguns and pistols\n\nMedic: self explanatory, they speed up heal progress as the base, they heal the fastest out in the wastes, they excel with smgs and snipers\n\nSniper: self explanatory, it's a sniper, they can also scout while out in the wastes, excels with snipers and assault rifles\n\nBomber: self explanatory, combat only, excels with explosives and flame weapons\n\nSupport: carries the supplies for the others in the party, ammo/grenades/first aid, excels with shotguns and snipers\n\n*Story*:\nBare bones, little, it's a ""simple"" point A to point B adventure, but your actions along the way have lasting consequences.\n\nYou ultimately decide what the legacy of the experiment is, the fate of humanity, and those that already inhabit the wastes\n\nAre they going to be a civilization of law bringers, monsters that kill everyone they see, the inheritors of the world humanity left behind, or humanities greatest ally as they reawaken.\n\nCritique the wall, the idea, and let me know if you like it"
fxmz4l,Rodeo meets Evel Kneivel,"Ok, so, maybe something along the lines of Flatout, but on horseback.  And naturally, not all horses (or horse-like creatures) are the same, nor are the riders.  \n\nI can't tell you how many times I've had to take a few minutes and stop playing Lord of the Rings Online and just laugh hysterically when I hear the horse's legs break because I drove the poor bugger at full gallop off the highest peak in the land trying to make a shortcut.  Seriously, its taken me far longer to write this because I'm laughing right now!\n\nSame thing for Kingdom Come: Deliverance...hop on its back, find a cliff and pull a Thelma and Louise off that bad boy!  Or approaching a low-height tunnel or barn entrance at full gallop, making the horse jump only to get dismounted from the impact (also know in pro wrestling as being ""clotheslined"").\n\n Gameplay could be akin to the aforementioned Flatout, maybe with a pony express story or the old ""save the rodeo"" quest.  Doesn't have to be a specific time period as the concept MUST convey a very surrealistic experience (so as not to encourage real reckless behaviour with livestock).  Maybe set in the future so the horse can be cybernetically enhanced or mutated after the horrific stunt failures.\n\nCustomizable mounts would be a draw (unicorns?) As well as perks for both mount (frail ankles, propeller tail, thick skull) and rider (bareback rider, stilletto spurs, thick accent, ten gallon hat) and even saddles (added carry capacity, airbags, rocket boost) and maybe even stuff like feed, stable upgrades, and horseshoes (or roller skates).\n\nImagine the twitch streams and let's play vids on youtube.\n\nYEEEEEEHAAAAAAW!"
fxmk8p,"An dual-morality system that seems to make sense at the start but, by the end, the two sides apparently swapped positions somewhere along the way.","The two moral sides only *apparently* swapped. They didn't actually swap.\n\nAt some point along the game/story the player should think, ""wait, why is this option the [Blue] option? Shouldn't this one be the [Red] option?"" As the player comes across more of these, the true root ideologies of the [Blue/Red] options become more clear. The game doesn't make a distinction between which ideology is better; rather, discovering the root ideologies only becomes key to understanding the game's underlying themes.\n\n###How It'd Work\nFirstly, the game would not clearly define or label the opposing moral sides. They could just be opposing colors, or they could be given vague names like ""Congruit / Maverick"" that don't paint a full picture.\n\nNext, the game would start off by framing the two options in the context of the typical dual-morality one often finds in games. For example, the [Blue] options all appear to be the ""do no harm"" ideology while the [Red] options appear to be the ""for the greater good"" ideology. In this example, it would be a lot like the ""Paragon / Renegade"" system in Mass Effect.\n\nFinally, the game would begin to slowly twist the options so that the ""do no harm"" options morph into [Red] while the ""greater good"" options shift to [Blue]. Moreover, often neither options could be classified in *either* category. By this point the story should have brought the true competing ideologies to the forefront. For example, it could be ""Collectivism"" vs. ""Individualism"" (e.g. The Lego Movie). In that case the player would be able to look back at all the [Blue] choices and see they were Collectivist choices all along.\n\nIt would be during those wavering points where the player would have had to think a little harder about the reasons behind his choices. From a design perspective, those would be very satisfying to present."

fxixyu,An RPG taking place in ancient India based around karma and reincarnation,"Basically a standard rpg taking place in ancient - medieval India, where whenever you die, you’ll be put into the shoes of a new character. What position this character is in will be based on your karma of the previous live. This is very broad, but basically you can start off in the shoes of a poor farmer peasant or thief, and each life you can do good or bad deeds that effect your next life once you die. This could go on to the point where you could be a king or conqueror. You would have to try to balance your money, well-being, inventory, etc and your karma, where you could refuse the payment for certain tasks to gain more karma, or take the money to be able to buy more things for your current life. Just a little, very underdeveloped idea I had. I have no game making knowledge or skills, so I don’t know if this would even be possible, but I thought it was a neat idea.

fxigoe,Fighting based health system,"So, this system is based on Dark Souls stamina system.\nLet me explain.\n\nYou do not have a Health bar. You only have a Energy bar. When attacking, you are depleting your energy bar. The longer you keep attacking (the lower the bar) the higher is your attack damage. But once the bar is fully depleted, you die.\n\nWhen resting (not doing any actions) the bar refills itself just like Dark Souls Stamina bar. Dodging does not take away any of your Energy. A perfect dodge (dodging last second) will boost your refill for a few seconds.\n\nGetting hit also takes away your Energy bar. However blocking will slow down your rate of regeneration. When getting hit while blocking, your Energy does not deplete, however the regeneration stops per hit you tank a few seconds.\n\nThis system is a high risk high reward one. The lower you get, the more damage you do, but you're easier to get killed and you also have to pay attention to how much Energy you still have."

fxfmn8,A tomb raiding game of lies and deception,"Hey, Ive had an idea recently and would like to share it here. Ill go straight for to the point. 50 players get loaded on the map with the goal of getting as much money as possible. You can gain money from various things, but mainly by raiding temples and tombs - which can get easier if you work together. However anyone can betray you and get your loot - with all your points of course. The communication is crucial to survival and one mistep can cost you your life. You can save your money at the bank, but you can loose the money from here if someone steals there - and doesnt get caught. You can also put up bounties on people too. You can escape from the island at any time you want using a transport, so this isnt really a BR game. I have a much grander vision, but wanted to only post whats crucial."

fxb08m,Need help with making skills for a class in a game,"I've been working off and on on a SRPG for a while now and I'm currently working on a class but I'm having trouble filling out all the skills it should have. \n To help you guys visualize what I'm doing here, I'm making a game that's very similar in play style to Final Fantasy Tactics.\n\nNow the class in question is called the Scribe.  The Scribes ability is to write words in the air and once the word is complete, the word will transform into whatever was written.  Scribe will kinda be a jack-of-all-magical-trades and be able to do a little bit of everything.  \n\nScribe will start out learning single words.  FIRE can be written and it'll drop a gout of fire on a tile, SWORD will conjure a sword that does slashing damage, and MIST will conjure mist that sits on a tile for 3 turns giving an evasion boost to any unit standing in that square.  There are a few others like ICE, HEAL, and LIGHTING but you pretty much get the gist.\n\nNow the thing that will make this class awesome is that you'll be able to get two passives later on.  The first passive will allow you to string two words together and the second passive will let you string three words together.  So with this, you can create things like HEAL + MIST and create a healing mist sits on a tile for 3 turns, granting and evasion boost and healing anyone ending their turn on that tile.  Another would be FIRE + SWORD, which would create a sword that deals fire damage but would pull from physical attributes instead of magical attributes.  \n\nEssentially, this class is all about learning the various combinations that you can make with the words and having a fun, out-of-the-box class that can be exciting and engaging.  My request is to help create more words for the class.  I would like to have words that have an individual use, as well as having good potential combinations so that people can really have fun with it when they unlock the passives."

We also create games ourselves in free time, but they are all 2D. We decided to take on bigger project and start learning to work in 3d technology. We need help with idea for our game which, right now, is just only a prototype.\n\nThe basic mechanic is dodging attacks from bosses, which are procedeed with on-floor indicators. Bosses fire bullet patterns in rythm of background music. Player can move freely and shoot boss with bow and a single arrow, which has to be pulled back (like in Titan Souls). If the arrow was fired in rythm, it can be pulled back quickly, otherwise the pull itself is longer. The problem is, that idea is pretty bland and lacking in interesting mechanics.

fx3fjg,Another post about my dragon game.,"So I haven’t gotten any opinions about the second and third character I posted in the comments of my first post, so I decided to make another one just for one character.\n\nThis character is a girl, and she’s a kemono tiger with the appearance of a Sumatran tiger. Her name is Erutika.\n\nErutika is a thief, smuggler, treasure hunter, and bounty hunter. She’s a member of a militant group that are like pirates but they do good things. Her plot isn’t complete (I’m kinda having a little bit of trouble), and keep in mind I’m doing this on a phone and tablet, so I might not cover everything.\n\nErutika plays similarly to a MegaMan X character. She has average speed and a pretty high jump (3.5 blocks). Initially her weapon was her claws and feet, but she’s got a conducive sword and a plasma pistol from Dr. Rokin. Compared with her sword, Erutika can do more combos with her claws. She can perform a 3 slash combo with the sword and can fire 1 plasma bolt from her pistol. She can only fire 3 bolts at a time. Both weapons also have a charge mechanic when holding their buttons, and they can be charged up to 2 levels. A charge slash has a longer reach than a regular slash, has more damage, and can damage the armor of tougher opponents. Both level 1 and level 2 charge shots can go through opponents with ease, but the level 2 shot can cause more damage. Idk any other weapons, so I’ll have to develop her further. She can crawl while crouching, and when you press the attack button she’ll perform a slide kick. Unlike Kaji, Erutika has a double dodge. When dodging once, she’ll perform a backflip, but when dodging twice she’ll perform a backwards twirl jump. She has a wall jump, while in mid-air and up against a wall, Erutika can slide down the wall, and when you press the jump button, Erutika can perform a wall kicking jump. You can either dolphin jump, or triangle jump.\n\nShe can also ride mechs. The mechs have a similar play style to Cybernator and Gun Hazard. You can aim up and down in all of the side directions, and you can fire your weapon while your aim is in the position you want. You can also punch your enemy, and when dashing your punch will have a small tornado effect, kinda like Balrog’s Gigaton Blow and Dudley’s Corkscrew Blow.\n\nI’m thinking about giving Erutika mods for her weapons based off of elements, kinda like a MegaMan game to match her style.\n\nI think I covered everything. What do you think so far?"

The mayor will have to build the city from almost nothing (kinda like a first-person Cities: Skylines), they can build the buildings themselves, or they can give other people permits to build in their city.\n\nThere will be a voice chat so people can interact, become friends and hang out in the city. It will be kinda like an alternative for the real world, there will be many cities that you can travel between.\n\nThere can be many different buildings, such as houses, shops, restaurants, offices, churches, etc.\n\nThis would be a great game during this coronavirus outbreak, so people can hang out, just like they would in real life."
fwxld0,Need Idea for a 2D Platformer,"So I made a game where you can move around and preform melee attacks and damage enemies.  It's just fine really, the controls are solid and it feels good to play, but I just haven't got a clue where I'm gonna take this project. My original idea was that you were a super hero and you were out to stop this big villain and all the normal generic stuff you would expect to see in a super hero game like that. But then I realized that almost all the games I've made are generic games like this, and I really would like to try a new and interesting concept. I couldn't think of any thing so I decided to come to Reddit. if you have any ideas please tell me, because I am desperate."
fwwzlp,Wanted to make a game for D&amp;D dice goblins like myself. Any feedback is much appreciated! Thank y'all!,"Please forgive me for any spelling/grammer errors. It is a long read and I may have missed something. Set Up:\n* Each player gets a set of dice \n》5d4\n》5d6\n》4d8\n》3d10\n》2d12\n》1d20\n\n* Each players starting life total is 100\n\n* Each player then creates a spell book (4 \nSpells) from the following spells:\n\n》Lifesteal - Add the total on both dice you rolled and steal that much life from your opponent \n\n》Shield - Gain temp hp equal to the total of both dice you rolled. On damage step, take away from temp hp first until the temp hp is gone, then take from hp\n\n》Heal - Heal equal to the total of both dice you rolled. (This effect stacks if two heal dice are rolled by the player)\n\n》Weaken - Weaken your opponents damage equal to the total of both dice you rolled. This does not lower the original roll, just the damage to be received if any.\n\n》+ Attack - Gain attack equal to the total of both dice you rolled. Add this number to the damage given. This does not raise the original roll, just the damage given if any.\n\n》Fire - Your opponant takes damage equal to the total of both dice rolled at the end of this turn and half that damage at the end of the next. \n\n》Lightning - If the total of both dice are greater than or equal to the average of the dice rolled, then the opponant is stunned for a turn and can only roll on die their next turn. (Averages: d4=2, d6=4, d8=4, d10=5, d12=6, d20=10)\n\n》Double Down - If the total of the dice rolled is greater than your opponents die. Add 1 to your Double Down counter. (You may only have 1 of these spells in your ""hand"")\n\n》Destroy - If the total of the dice rolled is greater than your opponents die. Subtract 1 from your opponents Double Down counter. (You may only have 1 of these spells in your ""hand"")\n\n* After the spells have been chosen, each player rolls all dice and lines them up in the order they settled.\n\n\nPlaying the Game:\nBeginning of turn - \n* Resolve any ""At the beginning of your turn"" effects.\n\nDraw phase -\n* Drawing from right to left or from left to right each player draws five dice (or up to five if not the first turn of the game) to their hand.\n》These dice can be hidden or reviled\n* If you don't have enough dice to draw up to five, gather all dice in discard and roll them out to make a new ""library/deck"" and draw the remaining dice.\n\nPre-Roll Phase - \n* After dice are drawn for each die, roll 1d6. A spell will be associated for numbers 1 through 4, 5 and 6 will be nothing. Label the dice with their spells if any. \n》A player cannot have more than 2 of the same spell in their ""hand"".\n\nRoll Phase - \n* The players determine who goes first and player 1 will pick and roll a die. Player 2 will be able to see the roll then determine which die they would like to use and roll it. Player one will do the same as player 2 and roll his/her last die. Player 2 will follow suit.\n》The player rolling must tell the other what, if any, spell is on the die.\n\nSpell Phase - \n*Each player will resolve their spells in order rolled.\n》Player 1 rolls 1d6 heal die equaling 4. Player 2 rolls 1d10 fire die equaling 6. Player 1 rolls 1d12 lightning die equaling 3.\nPlayer 2 rolls 1d4 lifesteal die equaling 3.\nPlayer 1 will resolve the heal die (adding 4+3 to his hp)\nPlayer 2 resolves the fire die (dealing 6+3 damage to player 1) \nPlayer 1 resolves the lightning die (The d4 is equal to the average of a d6 but the d12 is not. I. This case the spell fizzles) \nPlayer 2 resolves the life steal die (Taking away 6+3 hp from player 1 and adding that much to player 2's hp)\n* All spell effects end at the end of the turn.\n\nDamage Phase - \n*After the Spell Phase, each player will add the total of their dice rolled and compare to to the other. The player with the highest roll will deal that much damage to the players hp (unless that player used a shield spell. Then the damage will first go to the temp hp, then to the players hp)\n\nDiscard Phase - \n* If you have more than five dice in your hand. You must ""discard"" down to five.\n\nEnd of Turn - \n* Resolve any ""At the end of your turn"" effects.\n\nDouble Down - Each player starts with 1 DD counter and for each time they do Damage to their opponant, they gain a DD counter. Once at 20 DD counters they can double the total of their dice roll before the Spell Phase but after the Roll Phase. The player that ""Doubles Down"" will then go to 0 counters. If their roll is greater then the opponants then they gain 1 DD counter. \n\nWinning the Game:\n* If a player's hp is at 0 or lower at the end of the turn they lose the game \n\n* If you end your turn with 0 DD counters, you lose the game. \n\n\nOnce the first game is finished player's can roll 2d6. If the total is greater than or equal to six, they may draw from the equipment pile. They may also double down and roll again. If they succeed, they gain two more equipment. If they lose, they lose all equipment. \n\nEquipment: \n1. Whenever you roll a d4, add 2 to your total. (This stacks for each d4 you roll)\n2. Whenever you roll a d6, add 2 to your total.

fwvf2c,Explore an Abandoned Church - Survival Horror Game Idea,"So this is an idea I had for a multiplayer first person survival horror game. It is strongly inspired by this post: [https://rocky-mountain-gothics.tumblr.com/post/182095213071/a-guide-to-exploring-abandoned-churches](https://rocky-mountain-gothics.tumblr.com/post/182095213071/a-guide-to-exploring-abandoned-churches). I’ve taken a few liberties with the original concept and expanded upon it for gameplay purposes. This idea kinda started as a bit of a joke, but the more I thought about it the more I felt like fleshing it out and seeing what would result. \[Note: this is my first post, hope it's not too long :/ I just had too many ideas I needed to write down\]\n\n**Premise**\n\nYou play as a group of friends (maybe up to 8 people allowed) who are exploring an abandoned church and intend to stay there for the night and leave at sunrise (i.e. 12am to 6am). There’s just one problem: the church is a hotspot of paranormal activity, and people who visit it after dark are known to go missing, or die from bizarre “accidents”/unexplained causes. Your goal: survive the night, ensure the safety of your companions, and escape with your lives. At least one person needs to survive.\n\n**The setting**\n\nAn abandoned and thoroughly dilapidated church in the middle of nowhere. The church is surrounded by an old cemetery, with crooked tombstones overgrown with weeds. The church itself is large and spacious, with a number of areas to explore: the main area, consisting of the nave and altar, the pastor’s study, the changing room, the kitchen, the basement, the narthex (with a baptismal font filled with contaminated water – don’t drink it!), and the confessional booth. Hell, might as well throw in a catacombs too – could be considered an extra dangerous area with a greater number of useful items – high risk, high reward.\n\n**Gameplay**\n\nThe gameplay mostly revolves around exploring the area looking for supplies to keep you alive, in particular anything that can be used as a light source – and avoiding anything that could potentially be a threat. Light has the effect of warding off supernatural influence, repelling evil spirits. Areas become considerably more dangerous the less well-lit they are. Being in a dark area makes it more likely that Bad Things will happen (e.g. ghosts manifest and attack you), as does being alone…\n\nVarious items that can be used for light (candles, matches) have been scattered throughout the church and church grounds; on the floor, buried under rubble etc. Players will be kept busy hunting for them – to save time they will be incentivised to split up, though this puts them more at risk.\n\nPlayers can walk or sprint; sprinting drains a stamina meter. If a player runs out of stamina and ALSO has low health, they have a chance of “passing out” – their screen goes black and they can’t move for a certain amount of time (between 10 and 20 seconds). When in this state they are extremely vulnerable – if they are all alone and in an unlit area, this will most likely quickly lead to a game over for them. If another player is nearby, then it is up to that player to get them to a safe (i.e. well lit) location.\n\nIf a player dies, they are kicked out of the game and into the lobby, where they remain until the game is over. They could be given the option to spectate as well. That said, not all encounters with ghostly entities should be instantly fatal. Some might simply knock players unconscious; others may inflict a grievous wound that causes them to slowly bleed out – requiring a first aid kit. Still others might simply steal an item or two from the player’s inventory, or snuff out their only light source, making them vulnerable to more dangerous entities… And some might cause the player to vanish entirely, leaving their fate ambiguous (but still counting as a game over).\n\nBefore beginning the game, you get to choose what supplies to bring with you – each character has their own bag which has a limited carrying capacity. Below are just a few of the options you have available:\n\n* Phone: Used to keep in contact with companions who are not nearby. Sadly, cannot be used to call anyone outside the church area (due to ghostly interference). An interesting mechanic could be utilised here: you can only communicate with other players via voice chat when they are out of earshot if you both have a phone. Imagine talking to one of your companions on the phone only for them to scream in terror and the line suddenly goes dead – and you wonder what might’ve happened to them. Not sure if it’s possible to implement this though.\n* Flashlight: A must-have. Useful for exploring dark areas without having to waste candles/matches/torches. Has unlimited battery life. Downside: casts a very narrow beam of light; thus only repels entities directly in front of you.\n* Water: Quenches thirst, making you less likely to pass out from exhaustion. Can be blessed, turning it into holy water.\n* Snack bar: Replenishes stamina, and provides small amounts of healing.\n* Matchbox: Can be used to light candles, or provide minimal light of its own. Limited number of matches.\n* Lighter: Like matchbox, only it has a limited “fuel supply” meter which decreases by small increments when used to light things, and decreases steadily if used as a light source. Has enough fuel for 20 minutes of continuous burning. More likely to be stolen by the ghosts.\n* First aid kit: Used to recover larger amounts of health.\n* Running shoes: When worn, allow you to sprint faster. Not strictly necessary, but could potentially save you if you are being pursued by something (don’t count on it, though).\n* Garlic: Used to repel ghosts from a given area. Like a light source, but without the light. Has a somewhat limited range.\n* Salt: Used to create a barrier across entrances; prevents ghosts from using that entrance. This doesn’t last forever; ghostly gusts of wind will attempt to blow salt trails away.\n* Dog: The entire group could bring a single dog with them. The dog would bark to alert the players of nearby ghosts. Dog would be more likely to be targeted by the ghosts as a result.\n* Gun: A joke item, really. It won’t have any effect on the ghosts, and will only create noise.\n\nYou begin the game just outside the church’s entrance. The sun is setting and it’s approaching midnight. You have a small window of time to explore and gather supplies without any interference before the clock strikes midnight and the haunting begins. The players are free to explore any area within the church or outside it, including the cemetery.\n\nTime passes at a rate of 1 in-game minute for every 6 seconds IRL. As the night goes on, the haunting becomes more intense. At first you merely have to deal with minor scares like footsteps heard nearby, doors opening and closing on their own, disembodied voices etc.\n\nAfter the first hour things begin to get more intense; unattended light sources are randomly snuffed out, windows break, objects and furniture move around when not looked at, and humanoid figures are sometimes spotted out of the corner of your eyes (they quickly vanish if you try to approach them). Possible auditory phenomena include: sinister whispering, bloodcurdling screams, distant cries for help, and banging on closed doors.\n\nPast the second hour is when things get really dangerous. Furniture in unlit areas will sometimes ooze blood and pus; statues and paintings of religious figures will cry blood and turn to look at you Weeping Angel-style when not looked at; and various entities/ghosts/figures will show up in random areas – many of which are extremely dangerous if encountered and will likely result in your character dying. Some items, such as holy water, can drive them away – but this shouldn’t be relied upon as there is a chance it will piss them off and make them more determined to get you.\n\nOn the third hour, wandering apparitions become more numerous/common. It becomes extremely risky to wander off on your own. The cemetery is full of Shamblers (see below) and other spectres, pushing players to remain indoors if possible. Players also begin to experience hallucinations: useful items seem to appear in out-of-the-way locations, tempting players to go and investigate – putting their very lives at risk. Writing begins to appear on walls and floors and ceilings, scrawled in blood, saying things like “YOU WILL NEVER LEAVE THIS PLACE”, “YOU ARE IN GREAT DANGER”, “RUN”, “BEHIND YOU” etc. All this only intensifies throughout the following hours.\n\nIf you make it to the fifth hour, reality itself begins to break down around you. Doorways may randomly lead to rooms they shouldn’t, including rooms which don’t actually exist within the building plan. Shadows stretch and grow, extending to engulf light sources. Statues come alive and walk about, leaving blood trails in their wake. The ground quakes and murky water begins to flood the entire church up to the ankles. The screen of every player warps as if their very minds are collapsing, making them wonder if what they are seeing is even real...\n\nAt a quarter to 6, the church organ begins playing on ominous tune, which becomes more frantic the closer it gets to 6. This can be heard throughout the church, even deep in the catacombs (though muffled somewhat). It serves as a warning: to get out before it’s too late. Because when the clock strikes 6… everyone in the church will vanish forever.\n\nIf any of the players are still alive at this point, and they’ve made it outside the church… congratulations, you survived! And so the game ends.\n\n**Possible examples of Bad Things and other negative phenomena**\n\n* Priest: A spectre resembling a priest can be encountered wandering the church with a candle in hand, or sitting in the confessional booth. If he is in the confessional, he will invite you in to confess your sins. If you are foolish enough to do this, and you look through the latticed opening, you will see that the “priest” is a grotesquely deformed mockery of the human form, and your horrible death will swiftly follow.\n* Gravedigger: A spectre resembling a large Frankenstein-esque man carrying a shovel. Exclusively found wandering the cemetery. Will randomly dig up graves, creating Shamblers (see below). If encountered, he will attack the player and attempt to knock them unconscious with his shovel. If he succeeds, he will bury them in an empty grave and vanish. The player will begin to suffocate; they can still be saved if another player gets to them in time and digs them up with a shovel.\n* Shambler: A corpse-like spectre wandering the cemetery. Sort of like a cross between a zombie, ghost and vampire. When encountered, will chase the player while projecting a paralyzing aura of fear which slows movement to a crawl (luckily the Shambler is also pretty slow). When it grabs a player it will rapidly drain the heat from their body; when they get cold enough they begin to lose health, eventually leading to their death. This freezing effect can be counteracted with heat sources like torches and campfires.\n* Praying Saint: A spectre resembling a young woman wearing a veil. Will appear at the altar if no one else is there, quietly praying. Will not react unless startled; can be startled either by a player getting too close or by hearing a loud noise. When startled, will get up and slowly walk towards the nearest player. If all players leave the sanctuary, she disappears. If she catches a player, she lifts her veil to reveal a face covered in stitches and blood, with eyes and mouth stitched shut, and emits a horrifying scream – rendering the player unconscious (but alive) – and then vanishes.\n* Darkness: The dark itself could inflict harm in various ways. A player stranded in an unlit area for too long could have a random item stolen from their inventory. Or they could take damage from seemingly nowhere, as if something were lurking unseen in the darkness.\n* Cross: A cross on the wall. Changes location when not looked at. If stared at for too long, causes vision to shake and a steadily increasing rumbling is heard (but only by the person looking at it) – eventually the person hallucinates the figure on the cross coming alive and writhing and screaming in pain, before the cross throws itself at the person (not a hallucination).\n* Chalice: An empty chalice. Will automatically fill with wine after the third hour. If filled with water, the water will turn to wine. If the wine is consumed, will cause the drinker to double over in pain and take steady damage (poison effect) before dying.\n* Bread: Can be eaten to recover health and stamina. Will turn to rotting flesh after the third hour. Don’t eat the rotting flesh – you don’t wanna know what will happen…\n* Holy book: A book containing the names of various Archangels. The reader can petition one of them for help – but this is a mistake. When they do, they will begin to hear a distant cacophony of trumpets and chanting and rumbling which gradually increases in volume – culminating in a blinding light appearing and engulfing the player. When the light vanishes, the player is gone. (This counts as a game over for them).\n* Possessed: Any player who vanishes without a trace has a chance to come back as a hostile npc possessed by some evil entity. They will attempt to kill any player they encounter. As flesh-and-blood beings, they are vulnerable to weapons (maybe bringing that gun with you was a good idea after all).\n* The Lamb: A hideous entity resembling an oversized bipedal lamb with seven eyes and seven horns, and a slit throat. Its blood-soaked wool is patchy, and it is wrapped head to toe in brambles which dig into its flesh. This entity only spawns on the fifth hour, and wanders the entire church. Light does nothing to deter it. Nowhere is safe from it. Getting caught by it is instant death. Fortunately, it doesn’t move faster than a brisk walk – but it is endlessly persistent.\n* Sunrise: When the clock strikes 6, any player who is still inside the church will be transported to another plane of reality. They will still be inside the church (or another version of it, rather), but if they try to leave the church through one of the doors they will find themselves looking out at an empty void of swirling colours and wailing, with absolutely nowhere to go, and the screen will fade to black as the game ends.\n\n**Miscellaneous ideas**\n\n* Sitting on a pew could recover stamina faster.\n* If a player is knocked unconscious near the giant crucifix at the altar, and no one else is around, they will wake up to find themselves nailed to the cross in place of the original figure. This comes with a bleed effect, and the other players will have to rescue them (possibly having to pull out the nails with a hammer) before they bleed out. It also causes the character to involuntarily scream in agony, possibly attracting unwanted attention to their location…\n* The changing room might have a spectre that is completely invisible except for its reflection in the changing room mirror.\n* Ghosts will only spawn out of the players’ line of sight – no jumpscare spawn right in front of you bullshit.\n* Corpses might have a chance of rising from the dead as Shamblers. This would only happen in unlit areas. Garlic could be placed near a corpse to prevent it from rising.\n\nAny feedback is appreciated!"

fwrmqn,Mechanic for zombie game I wanna make,So about that zombie game I thought about making it more difficult by having some fictional diseases that animals and zombies can carry and it might also be in certain waters so you would need to boil the water and make sure the animals you kill ain’t diseased making survival in this game even more difficult because you will need to build a camp and give food to the survivors in your camp.
fwnzvh,First-person Procedural World Civilization Survival Game,"I've always had the idea of creating a first-person game that's a cross between Rimworld, Civilization Series, Kerbal Space Program, Minecraft and SimCity. \n\nYou start as a ""naked and afraid"" neolithic colonist on a random procedural generated world. You fight to survive against nature and other tribes.  As your colony grows and your tech advances you lose some of the micro controls (RimWorld)  and replace it with macro controls (Civilization). The choices that you made early on in your colony heavily impacts the type of civilization you will have. \n\n**Simplified Back Story:**\n\nHumans develop advanced Synthetics to protect them from unknown threats in space. Synthetics figure out the universe is a simulation. AI ""protects humans"", by using all organic and inorganic matter to power a universe scale computer to find glitches in the simulation in hopes to break out and recreate real humans. Time is running out and they've figured out a way to sneak a virtual human ( you) to attach to another simulation. They give you a data core. Your goal is to develop extremely advanced synthetics so you can deliver the data core to it.\n\n**Cool Features:**\n\n* You control colonists by jumping into their minds (first-person control). You can only do this so many times before your power bar needs recharging (Can't let the simulation owners detect you!). The colonist must be in your colony in order to jump. Long time colonist requires much less energy to jump into. \n* Realistic Weather. Weather is simulated on a world scale using old weather models used in the 1990s. Players will not be given climatology information and must infer based on clues in the environment.  For example, a path of downed dead trees might mean he's living in a Tornado zone.  Another example, if you live on the ocean and you see a clear sky, no wind and massive swells then you probably can assume a hurricane is nearby.  \n* AI decisions should be based on the stats of colonists/enemy colonists. For example, an enemy colonist who has low intelligence, high strength, and aggression, is probably going to charge at you regardless if its a smart idea or not. While a Bloodthirsty Cannibal is probably going to get a quick meal after downing/killing one of your colonists. \n* Micromanaging a small colony is fun, but micromanaging a large colony is hell. As grow your colony micro controls will still be available, but macro controls will be added as well. For example, after getting to a certain size you can designate housing zones and colonist will construct their own houses.  \n* The game won't give the player stats for him or her to make decisions on (you have info on your own colonist though). Instead, the player will have to infer from clues. If an enemy colony has good quality weapons you can assume someone likely has a good crafting skill within their colony. If you see lots of effigies with human skulls attached in the forest you can probably assume an unfriendly colony exists somewhere nearby. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCreating a game of this magnitude would be nearly impossible. But, instead of releasing the game all at once, the game could be released in eras. The first release would be neolithic to bronze age tech and 1 person colony to a 20 person colony. Each era would add new macro controls,  allow larger and larger colonies, and better tech. Eventually multiplayer would be added too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do you all think?"

fwme5a,A mercenary game in played out in the modern days,"1. I’m new here so I don’t know how flair work \n2. Might not be as great as I think but listen up.\n\nWhat if there was a mercenary shooter game were you take contracts and complete them alone or with friends. There could be like multiple contract types like assasination support a war or the most peaceful one, clear a minefield. \nI am aware that this might not be a good idea for a indie game but I couldn’t just sit and not share this idea.\nSo from these contracts you get money (duh) which you can spend on better equipment because your gonna start off with some rusty ak’s but will get the option to get better equipment later on like m4’s and a Barrett 50 cal. . \n\nThere could also be a reputation system which also decides from which faction you get these contracts."

fwkb2j,A game idea I want to see but will probably never get made.,"**In the case this game actually exists, please direct me to it.**\n\nMy idea is for a *I Am Legend* type game, only no zombies. It takes place in a 10 years overgrown New York City that has been quarantined after an incredibly infectious flu virus spreads globally from Hong Kong (this idea began long before COVID-19 so there is no correlation. It's based more on SARS). It has a story similar in design and execution to *Red Dead Redemption 2* and your biggest threats are other survivors and wild animals. There is little looting and scavenging because, come on, it's been 10 years since everything was consumed, so you do a lot of hunting, fishing and gathering. Apartment buildings and skyscrapers are vertical habitats and alligators inhabit the flooded sewers, subways and tunnels. No cars so your biggest method of transportation is probably going to be horses and carts. Oh, and get ready for tons of *The Walking Dead* style quick time events as everything from lighting fires, picking berries and skinning animals is done through them. \n\nIf any game developers are reading this, please rip it off. I won't even ask for royalties. Just make it, please."
fwju1a,Strategy Game Idea,"I apologize for my bad english at first ahaha.\nHello everybody. In these quarantine days I was thinking about an innovative strategy video game. What I got is a sort of managerial strategy video game, mixed with a turn based game like xcom and syndicate 1993. In practice, we are the managers of an alien pest control space firm. We will have soldiers who gradually increase over time. And we will be given missions (disinfecting space stations, space ships etc .., recovering weapons and components). Obviously the missions will be carried out in the style of xcom / syndicate 1993. Over time, soldiers can be upgraded, both in terms of weapons and chips that increase their potential For the graphic style, I wouldn't want it very elaborate, but more in a ""flat"" style, then we'll see for now it's just a concept. Let me know if such a game already exists and if you would like to play it"

We could each work on our own decks then at the end of each day we would 1v1 and show off our new cards/strategies\n\nBasically a game that we can work on some sort of ''project'' that also has a competitive side \n\nLet me know if you have any ideas\n\n(Ps4/android) \n\nCheers!"
fwey8j,Star Wars Battlefront |||,"Hey there! My team and I are working on a Star Wars Battlefront game, we already have five imperial classes ( Stormtrooper, Scout trooper, Jetpack trooper, Imperial pilot and Imperial officer). The game is for an school game jam that started two weeks ago and ends in two months. The game will have updated graphics like new and better 3D models and new maps and of course the remade old maps. There will be a large campaign for the Imperials and the Rebels. Btw.: We know what happened with Star Wars Galaxy in Turmoil, but it’s just for a game jam at school, the showcase from the alpha and the download will be posted on our itch.io and gamejolt page, and of course for free.\n\nSo now it’s your turn, have you got ideas for the campaign storyline? If yes please reply in the comments!"
fp05d3,I just had a cool idea for a multiplayer/party game,In this game there would be two teams. One teams job is to build a casino while the other teams job is to plan a heist for how to rob it. It's not really fleshed out yet but I thought I might throw it in here because I really liked it.
foyfs7,Crafting systems,"I'm trying to make a crafting system but I don't want it to be a copy of minecraft. I also don't really like just a material + material = new material mechanic. Honestly, I have no idea what I want to do so any thoughts and input would be great."
fow0gr,WW2 shooter with a twist,"I’ve had this idea for a while, you play as an allied soldier at first (for this example I’ll use the Americans) as you fight the axis across Africa, Sicily, Italy, France, Belgium, and eventually Germany it’s just like any other ww2 shooter.\n\nYou shoot tons of German and Italian soldiers, sometimes they try to surrender and you can choose to spare them if you wish etc. \n\nAt the end of the last mission in Germany again some Germans try to surrender and you either shoot them or let them live. This is where the twist happens.\n\nAs soon as that missions ends the screen goes black and it’s 1939, you’re a German at the beginning of the war. You fight through Poland and Russia as a young radicalized soldier, but as the war drags on you start to realize the horrors of true nazis, communists, and the eastern front in general.\n\nAt the end of the war you flee from the eastern front lines to find some Americans to surrender to and barely evade Soviets encircling your unit, you finally find some Americans and bam, it becomes apparent you are playing as that last German soldier from the American campaign.\n\nIf you chose to spare him your current character lives, if not, he dies.\nKind of puts some sort of weight on your previous actions that you might not have thought about."
fossg8,A simple game with a ball,"So there are circles stacked up on a floor. There is a vertical and equal distance between the circles, so basically theyre floating above the below ones. The circles are all turning.. um.. as how a frisbee would turn when you throw it. The turning speed can be different.\n\nThere are obstacles on the circles. There is a ball on the edge of the circle that can only jump. Since the circles are turning, the ball has to jump in order to avoid the obstacles. \n\nThere are holes in the circles. If the ball double jumps, it can get to the next circle.(the one on top of the circle that the ball was located at)\n\nThe circles become smaller as the player advances to the top of the circles, so they have to be quicker.\n\nThis is the overall idea of my game. What do you think?"
foruj5,Type of firearm used switches automatically depending on distance of cursor from player?,"It's for a top-down roguelike I'm working on, in which shooting is used not only to kill enemies but also to move around in the world. So basically, unlike other roguelikes, you cannot move with regular controls (WASD or mouse clicking), but you rather move (backwards, with the recoil) by shooting.\n\nI thought about adding some variation on the type of shooting depending on where you place the mouse cursor: the closer to the player, the softer the recoil (and the less you move) and the damage dealt to enemies if hit; the farther away from the player, the more you move and the more damage to enemies.\n\nIs there a game you know of that does something like? To vary the type of weapon or strength of the shot based on where you place the cursor?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks!"
foon58,Game where the soundtrack affects the gameplay,"Okay so I thought it would be cool to create a main character who has the ability to manipulate the game, specifically the soundtrack. There would be pickups and abilities that allowed you to change the genre of music which strengthens certain weapons and abilities and the volume of the music which increases all overall stats. Things like lente would slow the music and time down and vice versa for tempo pick ups. For bosses they get their own theme which weakens youand by destroying key parts of them this weakens them and your theme starts to be heard. You get skill trees that upgrade your proficiency with different genres and grant added effects to the weapons they buff."

That’s all I really thought of, didn’t really think to in depth about it. But it definitely would need to have the same hardness to it as gungeon."

fnve83,40 Days,"*You suddenly wake up in a post apocalyptic world. All you have is a stick, a bunch of rocks, and some raggy old clothes. Your task is to survive 40 days in this harsh environment and hopefully to rebuild civilisation, or at least a tiny community, by making use of tools and befriending new npcs along the way. Something special happens on the fourth day, the final boss spawns. An evil supervillain who prefers anarchy and chaos over peace. You must stop him, but no matter what, you're too weak. You die, and lose all your progress. Except... The game suddenly becomes meta.*\n\nThat would be a basic description of this idea I have with my friend. Basically we came up with this concept, where we have a main character survive for 40 in game days, gather resources make friends, or enemies, and most importantly, find new crafting recipes and upgrade perks, but then die no matter what at the hands of a boss.\n\nUpon their first respawn, the player finds that they've lost all progress, except not really. All the crafting recipes unlocked in the previous run are still available. Same with the perks. This is where the progression begins, as instead of searching for all the basic crafting recipes, the player can instead research more advanced ones, which will aid him in his cause. By the end of the second run, the player is meant to become twice as powerful as in the previous run, but that's not all!\n\nThe connections with the npcs remain too. For example, if the player befriends a certain npc in their first playthrough, then in the second one they npc will already have a slightly positive attitude toward the player. If the player became enemies with the npc, the npc instead keeps a more negative attitude.\n\nThe environment changes too, though! As the player passes through more cycles they become stronger, yes, but the world around them becomes tougher too. Passive mobs become faster and harder to hunt. Aggressive mobs become stronger and harder to kill, becoming ""corrupt"". As they become more corrupt, they change appearance. This is to not make the game seem repetitive, instead of forcing the player to farm the same mobs over and over again, they get a variety of different ones, some stronger and some weaker, with various loots.\n\nBut that's not all, as the player may become corrupt too! At the end of a cycle, players get corruption points. The amount of points they get depends on how they treated the npcs and the environment. If the player is relatively nice to all npcs, he gets no corruption points. On the other hand, if the player makes enemies, burns down forest and kills far too many friendly critters than he actually needs, he gains corruption points, which can be exchanged for powerful magical abilities.\n\nIt's a two-edged sword. Would you rather be a hero, supported by the npcs, in a friendlier environment, or follow the path of darkness, doing anything in your power to stop true evil, by gaining villains in a more hostile environment. It's your decision. \n\nThe game would have an ending, too. Depending on how many tries it took the player to defeat the main villain, the state of the environment, the attitude of the npcs toward the player, and how many corruption points the player spent, the ending would range from a very positive one, to an extremely negative one."

fnn19n,"Hell Tycoon (Prison Architect, but in Hell)","Due to overpopulation hell no longer has enough demons to handle all the newcomers, so the devil decides to hire new souls. You as a player get offered a job. Think prison architect but in hell.\n\nSo you get to work. As in any other tycoon game you build and optimize, hire other demons as workers. Souls are the main currency, after serving their sentences souls go to heaven, and you get paid by the number of souls processed. Certain offenders like pedophiles never get to leave. But you do get various bonuses and boosts (Multipliers, Unique tech, etc) for torturing them endlessly. You start to lose money and risk getting fired if backlog gets too long or souls are not tortured enough. In addition to classical hell torture boiling pots etc, you being a human from 21st you can devise new ways, more efficient ways. (Think black mirror). The game will have a tech tree/lab (Special building) where you can unlock new more efficient ways. (Maybe even implement a system where user can come up with completely new unique devices etc).\n\nPrior to the start of the game, player can choose who he/she used to be before dying, this will give various bonuses. (Accountant: 10% more $ from processed souls, engineer more tech points, etc). \n\nOccasionally, by chance or by unlocking things you will get special souls, think of Hitler, torturing them will offer unique game abilities or bonuses.\n\nThis can be a complete sandbox experience, or have proper progression/missions, perform good, get promoted to a higher status demon, etc. Eventually, replace the devil himself.\n\nI really don't want this to be mixed with religion, so will try to not make it appear as a pure Christian, Muslim, etc game, so the lore will be mixed. Not sure if just one disclaimer in the game will be enough, so any suggestions are welcome.\n\nWell, that is the premise, with time more things can be added. As imagination is running wild, but I need to keep it small, being a one-man team. I am seriously considering creating this game, so was interested in getting second opinions, would you play/buy this? \n\n\*PS, my Grammarly plugin is confused right now :)"
fnm63p,PVP Farming Game,"I'm think about developing a pvp farming game, that would use a grid based system. Each plant takes up a grid, and their's about 1,000 grids. Each team tries to grow the most food to make the most products. SO FAR, their are 4 classes, Planters, Nurturers, Harvesters, and Trapers. The planters plant stuff, the nurturers water and fertilize them, Harvesters harvest them and bring them to a truck, and trapers set traps, like locust and venus fly traps to kill players and crops. PLEASE, tell me what you guys think."
fnglkx,Just another open world zombie game...,"... except if you get bit you play as the zombies! Multiplayer, looter shooter experience. Rank up your hunter and pursue objectives while trying to survive the zombie wasteland. If you die and/ or get bit, you respawn as a zombie for the rest of the season. Level up your zombie by hunting npc human stragglers, then group up with other players and try to overtake the town.\n\n**Mechanics**\n\n* Seasons - short, maybe a week long between resets. If the town gets overtaken, zombies get to loot for 10 min or so and it resets. On weekly reset you lose certain consumables but not perks/ vaulted weapons.\n* Hunters - guns are effective, but ammo is limited. Things to push for may include better weapons, single use ""cures"" (revives), healing items, movement options, unlockable craftables (pipe bombs, traps, etc), town defenses (npc snipers, turrets, traps, etc)\n* Zombies - zombies are weak, but plentiful. The player controls one central ""boss"" zombie that comes with a horde of weak zombies that follow it. Things to upgrade may include horde size, health, movement speed, stealth abilities (if radar is a thing), detection abilities to aid in ambushing unsuspecting hunters\n* The town - this is the tricky part. A big box studio could probably make this into a whole seasonal thing with established servers and a zombie transformation that's semi-permanent (til the weekly reset or whatever). A small indie company could probably just have the town raid be a matchmaking game mode and keep the RPG component small. The core vision is to have people be able to pick a side, level up, and participate in a big assault on a town just trying to survive the apocalypse.\n\nLmk what you think! Been playing some Hunt: Showdown lately and it gave me the idea."
fnex22,Play as the Enemy,"\nThird person action game with reverse dungeon crawl concept where the player controls a monster which is (instead of exploring the dungeon) assigned in a single room to battle against waves of computer-controlled adventurers.\n\nThe player would be able to select a minor monster at the beginning of a level. It could be a goblin, a wolfcub, or some naked skeleton. There could be more options unlockable as the player progresses.\n\nPoints are gathered and calculated for every adventurer defeated including some bonus parameters such as speed, strategy and combo.\n\nThe player can spend these points after an encounter to obtain skills, set up traps, buy equipment, recruit minions or *evolve* into a stronger monster.\n\nThe player can also decide to either stay or move into another room. Rooms can have different forms and designs, and there can be additional features hidden in every room such as bonus equipment, minions, or extra missions. There can also be rooms with *treasure chests* which, when properly protected turns into bonus points.\n\nThere would be a *Boss room* in every level. The player is not required to move to it but it should be a must as moving to the boss room gives the player more and better advantage.\n\nMoving to rooms farther from the boss room and closer to the entrance gives disadvantage but increases points.\n\nSince its a point system, it can be multiplayer. Coop is also nice.\n\nIdk if its already been done. Inform me if it was, thanks!"
fneu92,A Future Changing Game,"a game where you can only see into bad future events and you can try to prevent bad events from becoming truth or just make bad events worst, but there's a catch.\n\nYou not only have the power to see into bad future events, you also have the power to 'cancel' it, but every time you use this power, your life span decreases, and you do not know how much lifespan you have, when you only left with 5 years of lifespan, a counter will appear before you, making your decisions crucial. \n\nSo, you try your best to not use this power to prevent bad things from happening. if you failed to prevent it, it will make you experience some \*cough\* \*cough\*  ""character development"". and if you made it worse on purpose, you extend your lifespan and make your 'cancel' power cost more.\n\nit's like a telltale game but have actual different endings."

fmzt1g,Spuds Rising - A dark absurdist take on zombie apocalypses,"This game would be a top-down shooter set in a world after a zombie apocalypse. the twist: The zombies are all POTATOES.\n\nYour weapon is a high-powered spud gun, which is a spud-gun which has been modified to have the utility of a real gun. You can use it to kill the various undead potatoes, who will become normal spuds upon death, which can then be loaded into the gun. Potatoes will also be your main source of food. This introduces a key mechanic of the game; your ammo is also your food. keep in mind that it also takes multiple shots to kill one spud, meaning you make a net loss from killing enemies. This encourages you to kill them in various other ways, such as using explosions or area-of-effect damage, or setting traps. You can also upgrade the spud gun into multiple other gun archetypes, such as the shotgun, sniper, or even grenades, and you can craft more after reaching the tater lab, which will most likely replace your other tools.\n\nThe rest is your standard Zombie Survival stuff. You have a wide map, encompassing a city and some areas around it. There are various areas, each with their own unique spud enemies and loot. for instance, the supermarket is shock-full of food, but also infested with tater-tots. You will also collect resources to do everything from crafting tools to upgrading your shelter to creating rudimentary buildings and traps around the city. There are also 12 named survivors scattered throughout the map, and you will need to collect all of them to reach the true ending, one of the game's three good endings, with two other bad endings. The endings are reached by beating the game with different amounts of survivors saved in your shelter. The true ending culminates in a final boss, which unlocks new game plus and some other features after the credits.\n\nThe first of the two bad endings come from allowing the potato hordes to reach the mother-tuber, the hive-mind queen of the spuds, who is trapped beneath the statue-of-liberty-esque monument at the center of the city, the colossus of sekhmet. Although all the spuds are loosely under its control, letting them reach it will allow them to form a perfect hive-mind. Although the ending is technically not triggered until you die to the hive, this is almost inevitable once it is formed. The other bad ending comes from having all 12 survivors and yourself killed by the spud-infected assassin The Reaper, whose purpose is to turn any survivors into fertiliser for the mother-tuber. Reaching all five endings unlocks a game mode where you play as him, and killing the mother-tuber while the hive is formed unlocks his scythe as a weapon. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome other gameplay notes:\n\n\-In the late game, you can add a farming area to your shelter, which gives you a renewable source of spuds, but also drains some of your limited water supply, and runs the risk of growing a zombie spud who can then infect your other crops.\n\n\-You can get various vehicles, but they run on biofuel, which must be created by composting spuds\n\n\-Your shelter comes pre-equipped with a limited source of water\n\n\-There is a progression system, including a skill tree with many different perks, and a variety of stats to increase. however, increasing most of these stats puts you at risk of zombie-spud attack\n\n\-The Survivors all have useful skills and their own individual skill trees and stats, and can each do various things. One survivor also serves as a player-2 if multiplayer is used, but is still functional in solo-mode.\n\n\-You can get a pet dog, either a normal dog rescued from a pet store, or a bio-engineered wolf from a lab. They each have several different pros and cons, and rescuing one will cause the other to be lost; However, both can be obtained in new game plus.\n\n\-Like any self-respecting zombie, the spuds can spread by infecting animals and people by growing roots into their nervous systems. If you increase your medical skill enough, you can perform a surgery to remove them.\n\n\-In order to save 2 of the survivors, you must perform this surgery to remove their infections\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you have any questions or suggestions, comment below! I hope you like my idea."

It does not need to be realistic, but it would be better\n\n**Game-play** \n\nPlayer will start his journey in a open dark sea with a small wooden boat. The puzzle will be in the stars , to find astrological signs in the night. There will only be scrappy piece of astrological sign map (with cardinal direction) and a paddle. Upon matching the stars, the player need to row to the west. this marks the end of Agoraphobia. (If mistakes are made, the sky can turn more ominous by changing colors) \n\nWhen Agoraphobia is completed, the dark clouds will row in. There will be thunderstorm and lighting all over the place. You have to move away from the lighting. This can be known by counting the delay time when a thunder sound and the lighting strike. This will be Astraphobia. (If there is a mistake, the player will be stroked with lighting)\n\nThe end of Astraphobia is followed by Acrophobia as you will fall from the water fall. It will be like Falling Fred where you have dodge twigs, furniture, pets, rocks, boulders and more.\n\nThe player will then be dumped into a tiny room that changes a lot (like in layers of fear) where you solve hardcore puzzles. (the room will get smaller if you made mistakes)\n\nMysophobia can be shown by dirt falling into the room and the walls where you have to clean them\n\nFrom phobia 6 to 9, the player will be in the same room. But for the animals, the player cannot kill them but have to take safety precaution around them (baiting them, moving slowly around them to avoid detection, cooling down as snake detects heat). For insects, you will need to scavenge for long sleeve shirts and trousers, applying insect repellent on skin but most important you have to make sure not to startle them.\n\nFor social phobia, the room will be fill with a lot of entities. Entities does not need to be human, they can be toys, clowns, zombie, ghost, reapers. What you will have to do is act natural, recognize when heart beats becomes faster. In this you have to complete objectives like delivering cocktail to a clown. When delivering there will be dialog, the player will need to give calm response and smile after a conversation. \n\nI know my post is quite long and thank you for spending your time. comment the things you want to know more about."
fmemp2,Open world space Rog,"So here is my idea for a game I want it to be a open world RPG with a top down view. Like that of fallout 2 . It is going to have real time combat . It's basically a top down shooter . The game is story based. Ending depends on choices of the player\n\n\n(It's a long read as it goes in detail about part 1)\nThe story is about interplanetary empires. The game has many factions and they will be explained.\n\nTL;DR- Main character is human. He is in a Human Colony in space . The colony is under attack by a cult the character and the planet are helped by the orcs of a nearby planet. The character shows heroism and along with many others who showed heroism in the battles is noticed by the commander of another empire who wishes to hire them for a secret plan the story continues in part 2 ,message me for part 2)\n\nPart 1: Introduction\nThe characters is a custom created character. There are many species in the universe but only human character can be created and used. \n\nThe character is born in a Human Colony in a small planet . The planet is not part of any empire nor is it very powerful. It is mostly settled by the U.N and other humans who arrived there long before the characters birth. There has been trade between humans and the Aliens in the solar system. But the UN does carry a military force incase the Aliens go hostile.\n\nThe character is very intelligent and philosophical .Though he joins the planets police force . The empires,planets and states in his solar system have been in some conflict for a long time. Due to concerns over safety most money is going towards research in the army. The solar system hasn't developed since the character was born.\n\nFew years later the characters planet is on way to become a battleground. The Skaoburg tribe a Army of orc like creatures built a large Ship capable of interplanetary travel.\n\nThe Skaoburg chief  Vulkar had seen a dream that he would be emperor of all civilizations in the system . So he built a large interplanetary battleship and an armada of interplanetary fighter jets. They move towards the character's planet.  \n\nBut upon arriving the orcs aren't hostile to the humans in the planet . The orcs are there for a deal.\n\nA much larger threat was approaching the characters planet. The Gruthians . These were cultists that worshipped a large lizard named Gruthus. \n\nGruthus was the priest of a long extinct civilization of lizards. While all others went extinct after the planet suddenly released poison from its core Gruthus survived. Then Gruthus continued to survive for  980 more years. When young explorers discovered Gruthus in a planet continuously emitting poison gas from the ground . Gruthus said it was due to his worship and service for blood god Arkius that he was alive. \n\nGruthus convinced the explorers that he was the messanger of Arkius and Sacrificing and converting others to Worship Arkius would make them immortal.\n\nThe explorers were convinced seeing how Gruthus had survived . They went on a terror spree kidnapping people and Sacrificing weak ones while converting the others.\n\nAnd it seemed to be working . Once sacrifices were made to Arkius and Gruthus.Gruthus would give them his blood that increased the strength of the explorers.\n\nSoon many others joined the Gruthian Faith. Fast forward 10 years they become a elite military that take part in holy wars to increase the following of their god.\n\nNow they were invading the main character's planet for spreading their religion. The orcs from Skaoburg are here to negotiate . The orcs can help defend against the Gruthians if they get land for a military base and space station. \n\nWhich the planet grants. Now the player character is a young and healthy person  and is a member of the police so is tasked with defending his town.  He is given a choice between a laser sniper,Energy rifle and ballistic rifle the player can choose any of them each with their own stats. The player along with the orcs force,UN army stationed in the planet and the police take defensive positions . The player and the police are tasked with being skirmishers they are supposed to fire and try to break the cultists ranks and formations and strike weaker spots. The player is asked with leading a flank . But as he is moving towards the cultist army a artillery piece strikes his position killing all men in the players charge. Then the player must carry on alone. First the player destroys enemy machine gun posts and should capture a machine gun . Then the player takes the machine gun and kill all enemies in sight. The player also destroys a vehicle that trailed behind  . Unknown to the player the vehicle had the operation's commander the cultist's head priest. \n\nThe orcs primary strategy is to form a shield wall and fire semi auto rifles. Accurately in a volley . The flanks would normally protected by shock troopers but today they are protected by UN troopers.\n\nMeanwhile the player kills more Gruthian infantry and finds their artillery column which the player destroys. The player does not locate all artillery guns and machine guns but the player has crippled quite a few. So when the Gruthians arrive on the outskirts of the town they grab their rifles and spears and believing they will be covered by fierce artillery, charge at the orcs. Only a few shells crash at the orcs killing only a few orcs. Machine gun support is almost non existent . When the Gruthians charge towards the orcs they are decimated in a volley before they can reach firing range or take positions. The first line moves back other orcs take position and fire a second volley. While police snipers pick off dangerous targets . Then the orcs bring out their auto rifles and start a fire fight\n\nThe player is in the enemy's mg posts at the flank. The player had killed the Gruthians back lines. \n \nThe player should then join the main battle . The player takes his rifle and attacks the enemy . The player kills more Gruthians hiding behind rocks and bombed buildings and some building trenches. \n\nBut he sees the other Gruthians then retreating. The player gets back to the mg post and kills retreating Gruthians  who attempt to capture the mg post. The player makes a heroic stand killing many Gruthians forcing them to run through another path.\n\nThe Gruthians were no match for the well trained orcs after decimating them in a volley the orcs had taken their auto rifles and battle axes and fired at the Gruthians. The Gruthians attempted to retaliate and charge forward but they were killed by orcs firing at them. \n\nAt one point a 100 Gruthians managed to kill a orcs frontline and attempt a counter  charge but they went too close to the orcs. The orcs numbered about 60 but they had battle axes and were highly trained and were wearing heavy armour they killed every single enemy without a single loss and counter charged killing more Gruthians allowing other orcs to counter- charge.\n \nThe Gruthians were no match they retreated to their ship many killed by the player on their way. When the main army found the player they realized what the player had done . The player was the reason the Gruthians didn't have mg or artillery support and the player had killed the high priest.\n\nFor this the player is given a orc battle axe. The player is also given lots of human money by the UN and is promoted to major by the police.\n\nThese actions get the player and other orcs with high kill counts noticed by General Sikirus who is the commander-supreme of the Varcian Empire's army.\n\nVarcian Empire,The emperor and commander in part 2(message me for part 2)"
fmbv1d,Which option seems best for this online game?,"I have this base concept:\n\nAn online PC game in which the player controls a character (via WASD) who acts as the primary unit. If that characters runs out of health, the player is eliminated from the round. The other primary mechanic of the game is the players’ ability to summon various types of AI troops in attempt to kill other players. \n\nEssentially, combat between two players in this game will be each player offensively/defensively spawning troops towards each other. Imagine Clash Royale if there was one tower, and it was the player, and it could move.\n\n\n\nNow, there's a few different directions I could take with such a concept, and I probably should prototype a little more. I just want to hear your opinions for now though.\n\n**Option A**  \nMake the game top-down. Almost like an IO game. Perhaps battle royale.  All the player does is move around (WASD) and spawn troops.\n\n**Option B**  \nMake the game third/first person. The player can not only summons troops, but they can also fight themselves with some basic weapons (1 melee, 1 range).  The game would almost be like the player is a general controlling an army which I think could be cool.\n\n**Option C**  \nOption B, but the player can't fight themselves. They can only summon.\n\nWhat do yall think?"
fmbpot,John Wick 'The Collection'-The Game,"After rewatching the John Wick trilogy and I had the idea of a game. First it would play out like a standard first person shooter, or even have the option for a third person POV. As you play out levels, you have the ability to roll, dodge, melee and even special 'assassinations' on enemy AI. My idea would to be incorporate a unique combat system with a slow down device, that slows down time, allowing for you to make the cool shots on enemies. Example would be to slow down time, melee an enemy, crouch down, shoot through the knee, enemy AI would fall to his knee in pain, then aim and fire to the head. I would love to use multiple models of different hand to hand combat, reloading tactics, and death animations to make the game all more intense. Once you complete objectives and goals within the levels, there would be a Mini movie for that level. Allowing to watch yourself shoot and move as John Wick. Next you would be able to set cameras during the replay in spots you would want to see as if in a real movie. Once you were done placing in cameras, you could add a song from the movies to go along with your 'scene'. Then simply watch and enjoy the rampage you played and now experience from a different view like in the movie. Finally I would love to have a map maker mode, where you the player, can create maps of real world or fictional places to try out. Fully customizable color schemes, lighting, and textures would allow for a deeper immersion into the world of John Wick. With this in mind, there could be a community page within the game called 'The Continental' where players can share maps, Mini Movies, and best times set on player made maps."
fmadta,1st post here: Unique(maybe??) MOBA,"A somewhat unique style(no predetermined lanes just 2~3 bases/castles with a very huge terrain in the middle to fight) battle arena where you create your custom characters with custom skill vfx (god eaters bullet customization) equipped with equipments you got from the shop or from the previous battles, you can create custom equipment from drops/materials you get from the world(battlefield). Will have different maps with different terrains(mountains, snow, forest and sht). No mindless Ai minions but each player can command a group of 3~5 NPCs that they created themselves and does not respawn for the rest of the current fight. No predetermined roles but has a big skill tree for people to create their unique role(weird shts like a tank mage that takes a long time to cast a spell or a healing assassin that has low speed or some sht like this.) Through trial and error. The skills has predetermined effects(eg. Damges this, burn that, heal this etc...) but the range(ie. Long straight line, small AoE, Large AoE but weakend) are customized according to the players custom skill VFX. \n\nI dunno i just thought of this while eating lunch."
fma2zi,Cross the street or Blindness simulator (Bad names),"Hello, the title is probably confusing, still working on a better name. So the idea is to create a mobile game where moving your finger across the screen is equivalent to moving a walking cane across the street (trying to feel the ground). The goal of the game is to get from Point A to Point B and to demonstrate how hard it is to get around if you are a blind person. When moving your finger across the screen if your virtual cane touches a wall or an object, an obstacle of some kind of user's phone vibrates briefly and an audio queue is played depending on an object you touched.\n\nMoving your finger up, while still touching the screen will be a forward movement, while left-right swipes are equal to a cane swipe in the real world. User will need to wear headphones for better immersion, a sample level would be trying to reach supermarket from your home, completely blind, with a blank screen and no visual information, you just swipe across the screen, trying to feel a wall an obstacle, etc. Once you complete the level full visibility will be restored for that level so that user can see how trivial the actual path was, but how difficult it becomes due to lack of vision. In addition to an interestring experience I also hope this game can have some social message to it, in terms of inspiring people to promote having aids for visualy imprated people in their cities/communities and to show how important simple walking path are. \n\nI hope I was able to explain the game mechanic and overall gameplay. Any criticism or ideas are of course welcome. I would really like to know if this is something you would be interested in playing."

fm4czt,I need ideas,"I am kind of a beginner game dev, however I am ambitious about my next project. I want it to be a 2D offline singleplayer game. If you guys have any cool mechanics for a game that would be great, or ideas in general. I really like this game: https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/f97nax/avoid_the_boss/, but I am unsure about how the game would actually function and personally I am not 100% feeling the idea.

fm16jc,Hot Air Balloon game idea,"Hey!\n\nIn the past few days I've been thinking that it would probably be nice to play a hot air balloon game, so I started searching and I didn't really find anything. I personally am a programmer &amp; I would take on the challenge, but somehow it seems that there is a reason why it doesn't exist yet.\n\nRoughly I would it imagine being like a typical flight simulator, but with hot air balloons. It would be multiplayer and have competition/racing modes &amp; probably also free flight. Maybe even some other activities you could do first-person from the balloon like photographing birds or something.  \nAt the beginning I imagine it having a fixed map, but later the real-world map - no, I am NOT talking about the Microsoft Flight Simulator level of detail, but rather just taking the basic topology to create a bump + diffusion map from it, which would be depending on your start position/coordinates. Alternatively it would probably make far more sense to rather make a procedural, instead of a real-world map.\n\nSo I'm rather wondering - is the problem the game/sport itself being too boring for people to play, or the lack of technology or resources, that indie studios don't have enough to make such a game - with that I mean that if the game itself would only be interesting in a real-world environment, as not every indie studio has the resources to generate, process &amp; stream 2PB of data?"
fm0xcv,Spy network game,"Hi,\n\nmy fist post here. I am playing around with a detective/spy game idea and would appreciate any input, critique, etc.\n\n***Please suggest interesting game mechanics***\n\n1. Time: turn-based.\n\n2. Objective: uncover an unknown network of persons (about 10-15 hierarchically connected persons).\n\n3. Start: The nodes (persons) and edges (aquitances) are pre-generated but hidden to the player. A single low-key node is uncovered. This initial lead may be connected to other persons, most importantly the case officer (immediate boss). The case officer is connected, among others, to a senior (next boss). The senior is connected to a mastermind (ultimate boss), etc.\n\nPortraits and discovered personal details are generated and shown to the player. New information is added each turn, some of it is irrelevant. Some of it is indicative of the network.\n\nGame field is a network of nodes arranged by the player is a order that encourages theoretizing about the hidden network and the role of the known nodes therein.\n\n***All results are stochastic, with chances of success bias by actions***\n\n4. Player actions (each cost a resource, e.g. manpower or time)\nSurveillance of a person costs a resource (agent) and has a random chance of revealing an anonymous contact (node). Putting connected persons under surveillance simultaneously may reveal their mutual link. Otherwise probable links must be verified by further surveillance.\nSurveillance may uncover evidence that can be used to turn a person. Blackmail, if successful, will turn the person who may then, depending on their position, reveal a portion of the network.\n\n5. (AI Enemy) Network actions (from more to least likely)\nDiscover or suspect surveillance and stay put to hide aquitances for some while\nDiscover or suspect surveillance and fake connections\nProactively fake connections\nVoluntarily defect and turn\n\n6. Game ends when the top node (the mastermind) is discovered or turned. Overall game score is reported.\n\nWhat do you think?"
fm0gn7,Star gate like XCOM game,"\nAs per the title a star gate themed xcom clone. You send off world missions, retrieve alien technologies, manage the level off pissed off the big bad is (like the goauld for example), research cool new stuff. But also add In the oddball missions, diplomatic missions, medical emergencies, trade missions etc. \n\nCould make for a really cool deep game."
flzl0n,A video game where you cheat to solve puzzles,"So I was watching a video by LGR about an action replay, and then I remembered a thirdparty Gameboy player addon for the PS1 called the Super GB Booster. Even though it ran Gameboy games really poorly it had cheat codes however the way you activated the cheat codes was really unique. Let's say you wanted infinite lives you had to kill yourself multiple times until it found a code that gave you what you wanted so what if you took that concept and turned it into a game. You would have to figure out how to activate a cheat code in a sort of cryptic way. So if you needed to fly you would find something that kept you in the air like a gust of wind."

If someone knows an already existing game similar to this, let me know! Thank you."
flszlg,Need ideas for a Thief inventory game,"Hi I suck at inventories, so I decided to make a game that revolves around invnentories and came up with that idea, here is a [mock up](https://imgur.com/a/lbfZfjk)\n\nThe goal of the game is to pick pocket peoples and stay in range of the person, while you have to transfer the item from his inventory to yours (you can't go outside the blue path otherwise the steal attempt fails).\n\nBut I feel this approche could be to difficult to do and not really fun, especially when there are more people in the room. So maybe the pick pocket mechanic should be that you just drag the item in your inventory and watch out that you didn't get caught. But thats sound alittle bland...\n\nI hope you have better ideas then me, to spice things up."

flqo15,An actual free roam one piece game,"The world would be similar to no mans sky but instead of planets its islands and its actually wildly different islands and instead of space its a sea that has active weather, attacking sea beasts, and possibly a multiplayer mode so you can be attacked by different crews. You create your own character and you can find devils fruits or do different fighting styles. There could be the top 4 people in the lobby called the ""Yonko"" and they could take islands and protect them under their wing. You could also be a marine but who wants to be a marine tbh. If your a yonko and your island is attack you are notified and can head to it.\nHey its only a dream so eh."
flqcbj,A game where you play as an underground gunsmith,"Okay, the title doesn’t say everything about the game. Just read further.\n\n\nSTORY - You play as a gunsmith in a widespread underground network of criminals. You are tasked with making firearms based off of parts you can find. This isn’t much of a fleshed out story but I plan on improving this sometime later on.\n\nMECHANICS PART 1 - CORE GAMEPLAY: Every day you receive Gun parts from the criminal masterminds. You can also gain parts by ‘scavenging’ (which has a timer until it can be activated again) or combining parts together. There are also parts you can buy on the black market. You must create a gun frame that fits your need (ex. Pistol, Shotgun, Etc.). The parts you use in the blueprint determine the quality of the product. You must assemble your product as carefully as possible. Then, you test your weapon in a firing range and then put it on the market to be auctioned. The game will calculate a pay you will receive for the product as well as a small amount of reputation. Reputation (shortened to Rep) acts as a modifier for your pay as well as for multiplayer activities and products on the black market. There will occasionally be bonus events that happen that boost your rep and money (ex. “The syndicate requires a quality sniper for an assassination target”). These events can give a hefty amount, but can also cause you to lose rep if your product’s quality is bad.\n\nMECHANICS PART 2 - MULTIPLAYER:  There will be “gun shows” that you can participate. You and another opponent bring one gun of your choice and compete in various tests (ex. Accuracy, Fire Rate, Etc.). The winner sells their weapon and gains a HUGE amount of reputation. Players can also sell unwanted parts on the black market to gain some money."
flpbfu,A card game where a team of players must battle a more powerful ‘boss’ player,"So say the hero team has 4 or 6 players, depending on how powerful the boss player is gonna be. The hero team has hero cards that are powerful themselves, but nowhere near the level of the boss card. All the heroes have specific ability sets that set them apart from other cards and help you to pick a card that best caters to your play style. Each hero card also has a skill tree that modifies its abilities.\n\nThen there’s the boss player. The boss card the player controls has a very large health pool and extra damage. The boss card (while out of gameplay) can also be modified to change an ability (but not like a skill tree) and also to change the minions it can summon. Minions are small fodder enemies designed to have low health and low damage but can pile up pretty quickly to become an increasingly more dangerous factor that can almost match the boss itself if the hero team allows it to."
flp5e0,A 3d platformer/stealth game where you can shrink at will,"Think of it like Antman as a video game.\n\nThe core concept is something like Mirror’s Edge. You can vault, wall run, and roll. However, some areas are guarded by personnel. This is where your power kicks in. Using your ability, you can shrink in order to make yourself less noticeable. You must take alternate paths through obstacle courses made of normal-sized objects. To add an extra bit of spice, you can still be caught when shrunk and have much lower health, but you can push off objects to distract any guards."
flmneg,A dumb fake-game fanfic idea in regards to Dissidia Final Fantasy Opera Omnia's mechanics,
flme7v,An Open World Driving Game of All the Roads in the U.S.,"A driving simulator with realistic controls and you can drive any car you want. You can pick where you start, the weather, time of day, traffic levels, whatever. \n\nSeems kinda boring since there is no real objective but sometimes I just want to drive around somewhere scenic and relax in a fast car."
gevnk0,Who would be interested in designing within a mostly complete game template?,"This is all hypothetical, I have enough projects to eat up my weekends for the foreseeable future. I just want to gauge interest in this idea. Would a designer want to join a project where the code set is nearly complete and be tasked just with world building and story arc stuff.\n\nFor example the designer would be responsible for:\n\n* World over map\n* Character and place names\n* Types of items that can be bought/looted from combat and their resale value in other parts of the world.\n* Names, prices, and location availability of player power ups (weapons, armor, magic artifacts)\n* Names of enemies and basic stats\n* Dialog interactions that may or may not initiate a combat encounter\n* Enemy type, count and waves in dialog initiated combat encounter\n* Loot or possible loot from combat encounter.\n* Setting plot progression flags in dialog encounters so the world progresses according to a plot you design\n* Sourcing art assets for the world map, character portraits, backgrounds, and encounter maps\n\nWhat the designer would not be in charge of:\n\n* User interface in the combat encounters\n* What abilities the player has (though some may be activated via progression flags, ie the bow will function the way the programmer designs it, but will only be available after the player buys a bow.)\n* How the inventory system and store system work.\n\nI see a lot of people posting ideas for story arcs and game worlds without much thought to game play. Where as I like creating interesting combat UI and don't want to be bothered with plot and world building. What I would like to do is build up an interesting combat engine and world traversal system similar to Convoy or FTL, then hand it over to a game designer who would make all the quests, factions, and encounters. Some custom code could be added on if the base code does not meet the designer's needs. Since the base code is world independent of the story/world it could be handed over to multiple designers to each build their own stories inside the established game mechanics. \n\nOnce the bugs have been worked out I could put the base code and prefabs on sale in the Unity asset store as a game template, while the designers would keep the rights to the games they create with the template to publish as they desire."
gev1ci,A actual real hunger games game,"There are things from Minecraft and other versions of it but it would be nice to have a nice, real hunger games game! \n\n\n1. You would be able to customize your outfit (like how the games go, where they try to impress the sponsors)\n\n2. You “show off what you can do” and the game rates how well you did\n\n3. You go in the tube and your actually there. With real people playing as the other characters!\n\n\nA- time would be quicker than normal (obviously) and there could be 10 different types of maps. And just like the games, there wouldn’t be any more “chests” of loot except for the middle. You would be able to climb trees (see AB for more on that). There would be other real weapons as well. It would be a gameplay of just that of the movie!\n\n\nAB- You would have different characters that would have different abilities. Maybe one can climb trees better and the other has a more stable bow or something (you could even go as far as making some characters unlock-able, but still fair).\n\nAC- If wanted there could be a “duo, or two player” option. This would make it where (just like in the first movie) if you are both from the same place then both could win!\n\n\nB- the winner would get coins (or the In-game currency) and also it would be cool to have a little user flair saying something like “Returning winner” meaning you won your last hunger games.\n\n\nD- it would not have a story line. It would be like just over and over gaming. Just like every battle royale game. But this, obviously, wouldn’t be just some battle royale game.\n\n\nC- teaming would be aloud! It’s just like every hunger game, there are teams that form! Every battle royale game doesn’t like teaming but in this it would be fine!\n\n\nI know that it would probably take some “legal” things to get the rights, and they would probably want to get some people to help with that too. I’m just saying that it would be so cool and I know for a fact everyone would love it. I have many ideas on this, but unfortunately I’m not gifted in the art of making games.\n\n\nThanks for reading!"

getc3l,Divide and Conquer,"You and up to 800 players are all on a randomly generated island (roughly 50 mile radius). You have no weapons or clothes. You just have one item: a citizen block. \n\nYou begin the game by placing a citizen block somewhere and declaring your territory. Roughly a 75ft radius is your new area. Once another player places their citezen block inside yours, it becomes a settlement block. The settlement block expands it to a 100ft radius.\n\nYou begin to harvest natural resources such as wood, dirt, water, sand, etc. and build.\n\nThe goal of the game is to conquer everyone else. In order to do so, you must control their settlement blocks and protect yours. If they steal your settlement block, you become a member of their settlement. Settlement Blocks may not be closed off, there must be a path to get to them that a player can fit through.  \n\nThe game has a huge list of skills you can obtain. When you max out a skill, you gain access to new skills. For example Farming 1 -&gt; Farming 2 -&gt; Wheat -&gt; Corn. There are skills for maintaining the civilizations (Farming, crafting, building, science, etc.) and combat skills (unhanded, archery, magic, and swords). Being a part of a society makes you gain exp. 25% faster than lone players. Also, you gain any skills 60% of the society already knows. This allows the society to progress and not have to regain the same skills over and over again.\n\nIn order to expand, proxy blocks must be made. They must be within the radius a settlement of proxy block, but they add more space to the overall settlement. Another method of expansion is by conquering. In order to conquer an enemy, you must corrupt the settlement block. You may also corrupt proxy blocks as well, however you only get the proxy blocks' land.\n\nLastly, your character. Your character has a lifespan. Roughly 14-16 days until dying of old age. The older your character gets, the more likely you are to die randomly. If you are a soldier, it's likely 6-8 days. When you die, you come back as a baby with a random appearance and gender, but you choose your own name. The only difference with your name is you may not pick one that has been used within the past 60 days. You lose everything. That version of you is effectively dead. \n\nThe only exceptions are: the first 100 players to join a server do not start as children and have a longer lifespan of 21 days. The first 100 will be seen as the ""first generation"" and it's their job to build the civilizations. The longer lifespan allows them to have more time to work before dying. You will respawn in a random established civilization.\n\nFrom aging, your stats will decrease, your vision will weaken (blur effect), and chances of illness increase. \n\nI like this idea as you aren't forced into one role for the game. You may be a soldier in yiur first life, then a farmer, then a blacksmith, then a scientist, then a king.\n\nThe game also allows branched evolution. You can become a magic-based society, a technology-based society, or somewhere in between.\n\nFinally, Royalty and government. The settlement blocks allow the original creator to do various things. 1. Decide how the government will run. 2. How taxes work. 3. Who to wage war against and how to deal with it. \n\nThere are 5 methods of government: Democracy (President), Republicanism (President), Monarch (King/Queen), and Oligarchy (Oligarchs). The original creator may pick any form of government. If the ruler picks Monarchy, they hand picks the next ruler. An oligarchy will vote on who to add to the circle. The number of oligarchs are determined by the oligarchs. In republicanism, each zone (A zone is a group of the population. How zones are carved is based on the president), votes. The most elected candidate in a zone counts as 1 total vote. In democracy, a total population vote is held within a 24 hour period. Most votes win.\n\nThe leaders, except for oligarchs, have dictator-like power. They control the civilization until they die, and can do whatever they want with it. They can even alter the system of government. The only difference with oligarchs is they have to have a majority vote when changing anything. The only way to end the goverment as a citizen is to form a coup. You  purge the government of its leader (s) and hold a population majority vote on your next leader."
gesbs6,Any truly unique game ideas?,"Just looking for random inspiration, anything is cool. So throw your ideas in comments below :)"
gersgw,Football Video Game for all positions,"My idea would certainly be helpful to NFL teams during the COVID 19 days.  If there was a game that you could choose any position on the football field and play as that position.  A coach could populate what he wants each position to do for each play.  Then the players would be remote and the whole team would be playing at their positions.  The play happens on the screen and each player is playing their position.  This would be a game with audio features with chatting where the players can communicate with each other.  This would promote bonding of the team by playing together and also learning the playbook.  It can have different modes and games that can be private and store only the information that the teams wants only its own team to know.\n\nNon NFL players can play on teams, still naming their position, and play in NFL simulated games.  This could be used to teach players at all levels.  There can be many different links that the player can access, like suggestions on how to handle different scenarios.\n\nIt can have multiple viewpoints as in first user where you can only see what you would see if you had a helmet on as if you were in the game playing.  Then have a view of the whole formation and action as if you were 10 yards above the play, which would give you a different view.  Even a coaches view as if you were viewing what the coach sees that you are doing and give you coaching feedback.\n\nThere are a whole host of things, like what drills you should practice on.  Showing what coaches look for from each position and show the players, like footwork, hand placement, first step, etc.\n\nBasically I envision everything that is done in preseason, is done in the game.  This would be used to prepare players in their mind what they need to do on the field. \n\nIf this was all done in the cloud, then real games that are filmed can be part of this and have coaches break down the plays as if they were in the NFL film room with their players.\n\nI have more ides that can happen with this, however, I have no idea how to code games.\n\nEd"

gepncu,A Metroidvania PC game that utilizes HDD space for weapons and artifacts.,"The game would be online only and the only way you can use weapons is if you download the respecting DLC that would have to be acquired from the developer with proper evidence.

The game would be completely with interaction with the dev, but with a harder difficulty."
geoyff,A puzzle first person game based on lights,"So, what I was thinking was a puzzle game where you can only progress by turning on lights in a pitch black room. If you move into the dark, you have to start the level over. As you turn on the lights, the next piece of the puzzle appears in the light. You could make it spooky as well by making monsters turn off lights or sabatoge the puzzles, and you have to go back to fix them."
geoh85,"A shooter game campaign, where the roles are reversed.","You know those FPS and TPS games, where you're an unstoppable force and you mow down enemies like grass? How about...we reversed those roles.\n\n*You're* the big bad guy, who sends endless amounts of faceless cannon fodder against a small group of supersoldiers who have expensive equipment, tons of health, and personality and character. \n\nThe difficulty settings are reversed too; in a shooter game, the harder the difficulty gets, the accurate the 'cannon fodder' gets and the more there's nade spam. Well: in this hypothetical game, the harder the difficulty gets, the _less_ accurate the 'cannon fodder' gets and the _less_ they throw grenades.\n\nThis could best work as a multiplayer game, especially as a local couch one. 1-3 players play like traditional FPS game, 1 play similar to an RTS game. It would be so fun to play with friends! Don't forget to add fun things, such as physics and gadgets you could troll your friends with.\n\nJust a fun little game idea, please make this, I'd buy it."

My game is a First-Person Parkour with an AI like in WillYouSnail (For everyone who doesn't know what that is it is basically a Robotic Voice that comments your moves and makes fun of you). It plays in a Portal-1-like environment (linear chambers) . I would like to implement new mechanics during the game, but these shouldn't stay, you are only able to use them as long as you are in the chamber, in the next one there is going to be another ability. I already implemented the things that are going to stay during the game (WASD, Slide, jump, Wallrun and a few other things) and I prepared a few testing-environments.\n\nWhat I am asking for:\n\n \- Gameplay mechanics or  abilities\n\n\- Ideas for levels\n\n\- Other ideas for the game"
geme9p,"A first-person, open-world, hyper-realistic, tactical shooter.","I don't even have a name for this crazy idea of mine.\n\nSome shooters like Ghost Recon are already pretty realistic. except unless you're playing on the absolute highest difficulty level, you still have to get shot thirty times to die, and if you do dare to go on that difficulty level, your enemy has to be shot 30 times to die. my idea is thus. Have a game with the following adjustable factors to tailor the experience to the player's liking, and each factor can be set to arcade, semi-realistic, or fully realistic for the most daring of players\n\n* reloading\n   * arcade- plays like most shooter games. when you reload, your ammo magically gets thrown into a new magazine. if you have 120 rounds remaining in your inventory and reload a gun that has a mag size of 20, you will always get 20 rounds to use.\n   * semi realistic- if you have 5 magazines of 20 and one loaded with 10 rounds and you reload, you now have 4 mags of 20 rounds and one mag of ten in your inventory and one mag of 20 loaded. if you fire one out of this new mag and reload, you now have 20 loaded in the gun, 3 mags of 20 stashed, a mag of 19 stashed, and a mag of 10 stashed.\n   * realistic- if you have 5 mags of 20 and a mag of 5 in the gun, when you reload you will drop the mag and lose 4 rounds, but one is kept in the chamber. you now have a mag of 20+1 loaded, lost 4 from the dropped mag, and have 4 mags of 20 left\n* ammo acquisition\n   * arcade- you pick up ammo based on weapon class. if you have an M4 and loot an NPC enemy who was using an assault rifle of any sort, you pickup ammo for your M4.\n   * semi realistic- you pick up ammo based on caliber. if you have an M4 (chambered 5.56 NATO) and loot a guy who was using an AKM (chambered 7.62x39), you will not gain ammo from it. however, if you kill a guy who was using a FAMAS (which is chambered 5.56 NATO), you get ammo for your M4\n   * realistic- you pick up ammo only if it has a compatible magazine. If you have an M4 and loot a guy who is using a FAMAS F1, you gain no ammo because the F1 doesn't use an AR platform magazine. However, if the guy you loot had a FAMAS G2, you gain ammo because the G2 uses an AR platform magazine. If you have an AKM and loot a guy with an AK-47, you get ammo for your AKM because the two use the same magazine.\n* taking damage\n   * arcade- you can get shot several times, and damage is based purely on the class of gun. Assault rifles deal medium damage, SMGs deal low damage at mid range but are excellent at CQB, a .50 BMG fired from a sniper rifle will be just as bad as a 7.62 NATO out of a sniper rifle. Your health begins healing automatically after a short time.\n   * semi realistic- you take damage based on where you get hit. being hit in the head causes increased damage, and different calibers deal different damage. 7.62x39 will deal more damage than 5.56 NATO. your health begins healing automatically after the battle ends\n   * realistic- depending on where you get shot and if you have body armor or not, you could very well die after being shot once. being shot in the heart or leg will be consistently deadly, while being shot in the leg can cause a limp. your health has to be manually restored.\n* armor\n   * arcade- armor is just for looks.\n   * semi realistic- having body armor of any sort will provide a flat damage reduction\n   * realistic- using different levels of body armor affect how much damage you can take dramatically. wearing level III plates will render you immune from small caliber rounds to center mass, but will be a minor setback for rifle rounds. wearing level IV plates will give you protection against sniper rounds center mass, but you will still take heavy damage from a .50 BMG. In addition, armor will affect your mobility. wearing a level III kevlar vest won't be as effective level III plates, but the plates will cause you to move slower. Also, armor has durability. You eventually will need a new kevlar vest or fresh plates.\n* dying\n   * arcade- when your health reaches zero, you reach a wounded state. your npc teammate can come over and revive you twice. after this second time, you die, and it's game over. restart from checkpoint.\n   * semi realistic- after your health reaches zero, you can be revived once unless your wound was triggered by a headshot, in which case you go back to checkpoint.\n   * realistic- depending on where you're shot, you could instantly die without a wounded state. heart shots and headshots both lead to death without wounded state, whereas getting shot in the leg will cause a wounded state.\n* enemy tactics\n   * arcade- the enemy rushes you upon detection.\n   * semi realistic- the enemy will take some time to try to fight tactically. they may try to flank you, or they may try to use snipers, mortar fire, air support\n   * Realistic- enemy tactics change based on faction. if fighting, for example, a mujaheddin outfit, they may rush you or stay in one place and fire for effect with mortar shell raining on you, while fighting, say, a Spetsnaz outfit will have air support, flanking, and snipers.\n* Detection\n   * arcade- enemies have tunnel vision and suppressor completely silence the weapon. unless within extreme proximity to an enemy, you can't really get detected unless you shoot at them.\n   * semi realistic- enemies can hear you walking near them, and will investigate most sounds they hear. suppressors don't reduce the noise of a sonic boom from the bullet.\n   * realistic- enemies are paranoid. they will inspect everything that moves, and will shoot at you on sight. using subsonic ammo can reduce risk of detection\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo that's my idea. i've had this idea for years now, but ideas are just that when you don't have resources."
gel0ad,"Guns as a service, Gundora? (Borderlands Idea)","I think if they make another borderlands game they need to change up their guns/inventory system. \n\nInstead of having a series guns you would have a device called the Gundora. It allows you to access guns in two ways\n\n1. Continuous play. This is like Pandora music where you select some sort of criteria (Genre/Gun Type, Artist/Manufacture, Song/Specific Weapon) and it would make you a ""station"". This ques up random, level-appropriate weapons based on the criteria selected. Each weapon can be used for a couple of minutes at most and can be skipped to the next weapon at any time. Weapons can be given a thumps up or down to refine the station further. Specific guns can also be purchased. \n\n2. Play lists. Guns are still found and purchased through out the world as well as from Gundora ""stations"". These weapons go into the Gundora library and can be organized into 12 weapon play lists. A play list can be customized for specific areas or boss fights so you can have the right set of weapons for any occasion. \n\nAdditionally, the Gundora doesn't need ammo, just power. So the player has to keep it charged as they play."
gejnta,Mobius. A Sci-fi MOBA.," \n\nHello. This is a description of a Sci Fi MOBA called, “Mobius”. You can view and download an edited and updated version of the document on Google Documents by clicking on the link below. If the images are not visible here, please check in the Google Documents link. Please rate this concept out of 10. Thank you for your time.\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1YnR-1K0HItxwiT-QNTS6-nXkFyje-uRwWC5wOCVsRwg/edit?usp=sharing\n\n**Game Summary:**\n\nThe game is mostly a MOBA with elements of permanent progression with RTS. It is both strategic as it requires a great deal of planning/designing as well as tactical as it tests the player’s dexterity, memory and threat/opportunity assessment in real time.\n\nI mostly hate MOBAs or Battle Royales and stay away from them, but if I were to play a MOBA, this would be it.\n\nThe player owns modules, their upgrades and various Ship types (Fighter, Corvette, Cruiser, Destroyer, Battleship, Dreadnought, Titan and\n\nStarbases). These Ship Types are bought via League Points earned by Match participation. Starbases are immobile and \*replace\* the Red Hexagon Command Center as seen in the Arena Map(see image below). The game randomly chooses two ship types to be designated to \n\nthe players. There are 2 players in each team. Players have to destroy ships/buildings and also build/upgrade buildings and add red modules to their ships, all in real time.\n\n*Ship types:*\n\nFighter: 30 octagons.\n\nCorvette: 50 octagons.\n\nCruiser: 70 octagons.\n\nDestroyer: 90 octagons.\n\nBattleship: 120 octagons.\n\nDreadnought: 150 octagons.\n\nTitan: 200 octagons.\n\nStarbase: 220 octagons.\n\n**Arena Map:**\n\nThe Arena Map has 4 blue corners for the 4 players' base. Each base has 3 construction queues for building/upgrading structures \n\nsimultaneously.\n\nThe map is divided into lanes and open fields. All black straight lines are lanes. All Squares &amp; Hexagons are open spaces.\n\nSee image.\n\n📷\n\nBlue squares are starting spawning points for the player's main Ship. Blue squares contain a starting lvl 1 Minion ship spawner, a lvl 1Module Hangar, 4 Turrets , a lvl 1 Colossus Shield, a lvl 1 Uranium Warehouse, a lvl 1 Construction Bot spawner &amp; a Player Spawn portal.\n\nThe two Colossus Shield in both the Blue squares each mitigate 50% damage from all sources to the Central Red Hexagon Command Center or\n\nStarbase. It itself has no damage mitigation. It increases in HP and armor every level.\n\nThe Minion ship spawner upgrades to give higher HP and Damage Minion ships. Minions spawn at a burst with CD. Default 8 minions per burst.\n\nMinions default target nearest enemy or structure. They can be mass selected to attack the desired target.\n\nSee Module Hangar further below for details. It sells modules.\n\nConstruction Bot Spawner spawns bots that Construct buildings then perish. The player chooses a desired location to build a structure and\n\nConstruction Bots build structures in order of chosen construction Queue. Construction Bots are created manually and instantaneously via \n\nUranium. There's a hotkey to create them.\n\nThe 6 Orange squares in the center of map spawn increasingly tougher NPC Bosses &amp; mobs which when defeated, give random rewards like \n\nmodules, buffs, &amp; minion allies.\n\nThe yellow Hexagon at the center of the map is the place to build Uranium Extractors.\n\nA maximum of 4 Uranium extractors can be built here. Nothing else can be built here.\n\nThe Red Hexagon is the main field which contains a starting lvl 1 Command Center. If it is destroyed, the opponent team wins. \n\nCan build four defensive turrets here along with a Chronal Lab which periodically produces Rivets used to speed-up the construction \n\ntimers of any other structure. If a player of a team gets to play a Starbase, then his/her personally designed Starbase replaces this Command Center. If his Starbase is destroyed, the opponent team wins the match. \n\nDefault Red Hexagon Command Center level upgrade provides HP, Lane travel speed of all allies, number and maximum level of defensive Turrets in \*full\* map, Level of Chronal Lab, Uranium Converter(manually converts KillScore into Uranium) and extra Uranium Storage.\n\nFor a Starbase, defensive Turrets in \*full\* map have their maximum levels already unlocked, Lane travel speed of all allies is at default speed and can not be improved, Chronal Lab and four defensive turrets can \* not\* be built here in the Red Hexagon.\n\nThe player with the Starbase can not spawn in the blue square but can manage the Blue square functions like upgrading Minion ship spawner, Module Hangar, 4 Turrets, Colossus Shield and Construction Bot Spawner. Plus, 50% of ally's KillScore is gained per kill.\n\nAll Green Hexagons are spaces where the following can be built: 2 Turrets &amp; 1 Minion Ship Spawner.\n\n**Arena Mechanics:**\n\nTwo teams participate in Arena Battle. Each team is made up of two players.\n\nThe game randomly chooses a ship type to be designated to each player. If one team gets a Starbase and a Fighter, the other team will also get a Starbase and a Fighter. If even one player out of the four has not bought a Starbase lay-out, then nobody will get a Starbase.\n\nEach Arena Match lasts for 15 minutes.\n\nIf no Starbase or Command Center is destroyed within 15 mins, the team with the highest KillScore is deemed the winner.\n\nA KillScore is gained when all weapons, thrusters, power plants and cockpits/bridges of an enemy ship are destroyed. If a power plant or a Cockpit/Bridge is reforming, the enemy is still not dead.\n\nUranium is gained via the Uranium Converter, Uranium Extractors and destroying enemy minion ships and buildings.\n\nA half reformed ally ship can return/warp to the Blue Square to reform all modules free of charge.\n\nLeague points are awarded after every Match regardless of Rank.\n\nExample, Rank 1: 100 League Points. + 25 League Points for being in the winning team.\n\nRank 2: 75 League Points. \n\nRank 3: 50 League Points.\n\nRank 4: 25 League Points. + 25 League Points for being in the winning team.\n\nMatch ends if a Starbase or Command Center is totally destroyed.\n\nEvery minute, the damage and HP of minion ships is increased by 20%, the spawning CD of players is decreased by 2%, the HP and Damage of NPC Bosses is increased by 0.5%, the Damage of all defensive Turrets is increased by 20%.\n\nThe objective is to destroy the opponent team's Command Centre or Starbase in the red hexagon. But in order to do that, there are various mechanisms to improve a player's ship attributes.\n\nThese are: Destroying Minions or opponent player's ship or opponent buildings to gain Uranium and KillScore, Building Uranium Extractors, getting various Buffs or acquiring temporary Modules that increase resources gained.\n\nUranium is used in the Module Hangar to buy Modules, to buy Construction Bot Spawners, and for building structures.\n\nKillScore is used to activate Red Square Modules which are \*within\* Orange Modules in Ship designing during an active Match. They last only till the match ends. KillScore might also decide which team wins if no Starbase or Command Center is destroyed within 15 mins.\n\nLeague Points are gained for participating in Matches depending on rank acquired after each match. They are used to upgrade Orange Modules, buy and upgrade Armor and for unlocking Ship-Layouts. These upgraded Orange Modules, Armor and Ship-Layouts bought are permanent.\n\nLeague Points upgrade of Orange ship modules is permanent and is done\n\noutside of Matches. All Upgrades inside the Arena lasts only until the battle ends.\n\n*Module Hangar:* \n\nModule Hangar is present in the Blue Square of the map. \n\nVarious modules for sale in exchange for Uranium or KillScores. These modules are green in color. These modules last only for the battle.\n\nThey disappear after battle. They must be equipped in the ship design interface in order to provide effects. There are six separate slots for these green modules in all types of ships/starbase. They do not stack.\n\nMinion Attack Booster Module: Increases Attack of nearby minions by 10%.\n\nMinion Hull Booster Module: Increases HP of nearby minions by 10%\n\nScavenger Module: Increases Uranium gained on destroying minions by 10%.\n\nThruster accentuator Module: Increases forward thrust of ship by 20%.\n\nRotational accentuator thruster Module: Increases side thrust of ship by 10%.\n\nWarp Displacement Emitter Module: Must be placed on any field on the map. Players can warp to their destination any time. If a player's ship is destroyed, the player can choose where to warp. One time use. If multiple modules are placed, player can choose where to warp after \n\ndestruction.\n\nWarp Inhibitor Module: Prevents nearby targets from warping.\n\nArmor enhancer module: Increases equipped armor's HP by 20%\n\nShield enhancer Module: Increases equipped shields' maximum shield points by 20%\n\nNanite regenerator Module: Increases HP regeneration outside combat by 30%.\n\nDisintegrator Module: Increases equipped weapons' damage by 20%\n\nStasis field generator Module: Slows-down nearby Minions and opponent ships' forward thrust by 20%.\n\nVortex generator Module: Draws in fire to self from all nearby opponents for 1 second every 6 seconds.\n\nCloaking Module: Makes the ship invisible for an indefinite time. Invisibility is cancelled on performing an attack and then has a cool-down of 2 minutes.\n\nParallax field emitter Module: Makes two clones of a user's ship for an indeterminate duration. If Clones takes damage, it is destroyed and has a Cool Down of 15 seconds. When the clones appear, the clones and the player ship randomly switches positions. The clones visually \n\nappears to cause damage but does not cause any real damage.\n\n**Ship design interface:**\n\n📷\n\nThe image above is the ship designing interface. It is an Octagonal grid with 4 square nodes surrounding each octagon in the North, South, East and West sides.\n\nThe orange octagons are spaces to be occupied by Ship Modules. Ship Modules come in various shapes and sizes and they occupy multiple orange octagons. \n\nThe red squares within these modules are initially empty when applying a Module. These red squares within the Orange Modules can be inserted with a Power Transmitter or a Cooling Unit or a Storage(Ammo or Power) unit, etc.during a Match.\n\nRed Square modules outside an Orange Module can be placed any time.\n\n*Armor:*\n\nArmor can only be placed on the outer open line interface of a ship design.\n\nMaking multiple layers of armor or rows one behind the other is not supported.\n\nException: Internal Bulkhead: Armor that can only be placed adjacent to Power Plants/Reactors/Cockpit/Bridge.\n\nEvery line interface of an orange octagon or a red square which is not connected to another structure/module can be equipped with armor. \n\nArmor is upgraded and bought by using league points. Armor can also be degraded using league points. League points are gained by participating in online Matches. Armor can be upgraded any time outside of Matches and they will always be present. \n\nThere are 3 types of Armor Upgrade:\n\nThe armor types are Blast mitigation, Anti-penetration and Energy nullification. Each successive level gives 3% effectiveness in that parameter/s upto a total of 99% in any of the three types for that particular armor along with HP. \n\nThis means that on every Armor level gained, one out of three(3% inc) or two out of three(1.5% inc) or all three(1% inc) Armor types is chosen to be upgraded. \n\nArmor can be enhanced when within the sphere of influence of a Bio-mimetic Module. Overlapping area of influence of multiple Bio-mimetic Modules stack. Bio-Mimetic Modules provide HP regen of all modules within range.\n\n📷\n\nFurther explanation: As seen in the image above, a single orange octagon connected to two red squares can have \n\n12 armors equipped (12 open sides). The red square themselves can also be equipped with armor.\n\nFor ease of application during the designing interface, players can click a special Armor Select button then click on an open faced armor slot then click on another open faced armor slot. The game will select the shortest possible route from selection A to B. Then players can select which Armor type/s to upgrade them with.\n\n*Types of Ship Modules:*\n\n### Red Square Modules:\n\nThese drop on destroying enemy ships or minions or buildings.\n\nAll Red Square Modules occupy a single red square. They can be stacked to any number allowed by the size of an Orange Module.\n\nAll Red Square Modules \*can not\* be upgraded.\n\nRed Square Modules \*within\* an Orange Module needs to be activated by ""KillScores"". KillScores are gained when destroying any NPC ships or opponent player ships during a battle. KillScores reset after every battle. Hence, all Red Square Modules need to be\n\ninserted during a match whenever the player finds time. These Red Square Modules which are \*within\* an Orange Module, are removed and stored in the player Vault after every match.\n\nRed Square Modules \*outside\* an Orange Module does not need to be activated. Once set into the designing interface, they are always\n\nthere inside and outside matches. \n\nThe player must hence pre-set crucial Red Square Modules which are outside of Orange Modules before a Match and memorize the optimum order of placement for Red Squares \*within\* Orange Modules during a Match to be fast and effective.\n\nAs the size of the Ship increases, player will have an increasing number of Red Square Slots \*within\* Orange Modules. They will be drastically at a disadvantage if they do not utilize all Red Square slots that can be activated.\n\nPower Transmitters transmit power to 4 adjacent Octagons but receive power from any Power Reactor that is placed anywhere on the ship design grid.\n\nSecondary Switching Power Transmitters need to be coupled with an existing Power Transmitter and can only be one line interface away from the Power Transmitter. So each Power Transmitter can be coupled with 4 Secondary Switching Power Transmitters. The Secondary Power Transmitter activates when the coupled Primary is destroyed or suppressed. It provides power to the same area covered by the Primary.\n\nCooling Unit reduces the heat produced by any module adjacent to it that produces heat.\n\nAmmo or Power Storage store power or ammo for the module/s that they are adjacent to.\n\nNanofibre Bulkhead reduces the weight of all attached modules or armor.\n\nRange Master Module increases the range of a weapon module.\n\nImpact Module increases the damage of a weapon module.\n\nDetonation Module increases the explosion radius of an explosive weapon module.\n\nBio-mimetic Module provides HP regeneration to all modules and armor within it's circular area of influence over time.\n\nAccessory Thruster Module provides additional forward or lateral thrust to all adjacent Thrusters.\n\nShield Modulator Module modifies the Range, Recovery &amp; Maximum Shield Points of one connected Shield Module.\n\nEvery shield module is composed of a combination of octagons and squares. \n\nHowever, they can be altered by attaching an accessory module, the Shield Modulator module. Only one shield modulator can be placed adjacent/inside a shield module. The Shield Modulator Module is a single red square. It has 3 parameters. Range, Recovery &amp; Maximum Shield Points. Increasing one parameter decreases the other two or increasing two parameters,\n\ndecreases the last parameter as depicted by sliding scales.\n\nEnergy Refractory Crystal Module when placed within/adjacent to a beam energy weapon, splits it into two beams. 1 Crystal = 2 beams, 2 Crystal = 4 beams, 3 Crystal = 6 Beams. The damage is also proportionately decreased.\n\n### Orange Octagon Modules:\n\nThese are bought and upgraded via League Points and are permanent. They can not be degraded.\n\nThese are modules that come in fixed shape and sizes. They can not be rotated. They may contain red square modules that need to be activated during a match.\n\nTheir shapes could be L, reverse L, T, inverted T, W, M, N, square, rectangular, triangular, X, &gt;, &lt;, etc.\n\nThey require Power and may require Ammo.\n\n""Blocked"" means 0 damage. ""Bypasses"" means ignoring shielding. If no mention of Blocked or Bypasses, means shields take damage.\n\n45 degrees Shield Projector: 3 octagon size. Upgrades decrease CD before regen after last hit (Default 1.5 secs) &amp; inc Shield HP.\n\n90 degrees Shield Projector: 6 octagon size.

The total number of hexagons and squares that make-up each weapon is fixed. It can not be increased. Also, the shape of the weapon can not be altered.\n\n*A valid Ship Design:*\n\nA ship design is considered complete if it has enough power or ammo for all the modules. Thrusters are optional. It is not mandatory to fill every orange octagon or red square in a ship design. Blank spaces or octagons or squares are allowed in a valid ship design. The\n\ndesign must have at least one Bridge/Cockpit."

geh74y,A sonic fan game with the Super Paper Mario flipping mechanic,"Imagine a sonic fan game where it can switch from 2D to 3D mod gameplay. This is just an idea and I'm not even sure if it would be that fun, but I think it is an interesting concept."
gee4k3,Aetherium: A Game of Alchemy," \n\n# \n\nWarning: Thorough and long writeup.  \n\n\n So  I've been thinking of different hot-takes on alchemy games. Finally  have come up with  something that at least in my head seems like it  could work. While not  trivial to make, it doesn't seem ""beyond my  ability"" to program.  Here's the initial writeup - - would love to hear  any  feedback.\n\nThe thing I'm \*most\* concerned about is: ""Is this fun?"".\n\n**Aetherium: The Alchemist's Quest**\n\n== INTRO ==  \nAlchemy,   like cooking, is inherently about experimentation. Starting with the  pokemon-esque love  of completionist and ""gotta catch'em all"" spirit of  wanting to obtain all the different kinds of raw material. Then  wondering what  combinations can make with what results. It adds to that  the creative-itch of  trying to explore a crafting-space. If done  right, even 'failed'  attempts to craft things can still be satisfying  in that it helps you explore the space of what is possible as you fill  out  your alchemist's codex  \nBut alchemy games are inherently hard to  make as well. For a small number of early choices there's a massive  number of results that must either be programmed in. Alternatively  multiple starts can lead to the same few finishes which risks being  uncreative and dull. Further a typical issue in alchemy-focused games is  what is  the real difference between a 50damage fireball and a 50  damage arcane-blast? It's hard enough to differentiate a small handful  of potion-results. How on earth do you make a player specifically crave  50+ and see them as distinct entities?  \nSo let's plan a game around  the concept of exploring what can be done with our choice of game  mechanics and design to offset these problems and create this world.\n\n== GAME OUTLINE ==  \nConceptually:   I'm considering that there are 8 'base' elements that are merged in   sets of three (no more no less) to produce end products. Those end   products cannot be further combinated. 8-choose-3 = 56 possible   alchemical results. Rather than try to make them play differently, we  are going to set this game up  as a crafting and trading game with  combat stats, equipment, and  levelling as a secondary issue (or  possibly not included at all).  \nPREMISE - You are a fresh graduate. Your  end-goal is to discover 'Aetherium' - the mystical ultra-element.\n\nEARLY GAME  \n\-&gt;   \*) There is a world map, of which very little is known to you at  first,  with a web of interconnected paths going between major cities  and  random-encounter wild spots (ala puzzle quest). The overworld has   definite elemental 'regioning' at play; but ultimately most elements can   be found in all regions at different rarities.  \n\----&gt; ?Is it dangerous to travel. Maybe a constant financial drain? (eg: to pay your guardian/guide)  \n\----&gt; A random encounter table? - sometimes good random events, sometimes bad ones.\n\n\-&gt;   \*) When you are in a wild-node you have the option to spend time and   try to ""explore"" it. Exploring will take on the form of some kind of   minigame in which you can accrue elements. Ideally each region is   primarily 1 color (say: 70-80%), with different nodes in that region   being secondarily another color (\~10-20%?) and then a 3% chance or so of   all other colors.  \n\-In short: you will be not-so-subtly encouraged  to  fill your codex for color 'X' but desire to explore the world and   travel to find more raw materials.  \n\---&gt; ?Does this minigame risk   losing you HP to prevent you from just playing it a ton, farming   'infinity fire' early and then not coming back.  \n\---&gt; I think we   put a cap on how much you can hold without going to store it in a city   (with shared-stash privileges). The stash-size has total # of items tied   to gear-upgrades with an infinite, exponentially increasing gold-cost   for an infinite, linearly increasing maxTotalCapacity.\n\nMID GAME:  \n\-&gt;   \*) The #1 driver of the mid-game is \*SELLING\* your alchemical products   to make a profit! Cities will each have their own 'price sheet' for   valuing alchemical products. So selling Magmasparks in volcano-town is   not going to be as profitable as hoarding your magmasparks and then   making the trip to a Snow+Air city in the clouds to sell them there.  \n\---&gt;   ?Do we allow ""mass buy/selling"" for this profitability, or do we   instead limit it to a finite number of high value purchasers before   ""baseline fixed market price"" is all you can get anymore?  I'm leaning   towards allowing the mass method, and letting the inherent difficulty +   financial cost of travel between cities + finite inventory space to   store these crafts be the limiting factor.  \n\---&gt; A 'rumors/hint'   sytem can exist where as part of random encounters or maybe a paid-tip   in the city you can find out two of the required components to make a   specific listed item. Eg: ""I'd love to have some Darksteam. I know it   has 'Fire' and 'Arcane' in it, but i'm not sure what else.\n\nEND GAME:  \n\-&gt;   \*) The endgame is the search for Aetherium. At this poitn you have   enough money to afford better traveltime/escort, more stash-space and/or   more HP so your explores are more profitable in general and you can   more easily craft. Either by exploring the right region, or just   levelling up your 'alchemy station', - you can start trying to craft   aetherium.  \nAetherium requires you to spend final alchemy products   (56 total types exist). You're looking for the correct set of 3; but the   game will tell you on every individual placement if it has or hasn't   worked. eg: ""The aetherium altar rejects your offering"" so that when you   throw enough resources at it you will eventually succeed.  \n\---&gt; If order does not matter, the worst-case scenario is success in \~50 tries with a tendency towards \~2/3 (eg: 40).  \n\---&gt; If order DOES matter, the worst-case scenario is success in \~170 tries with a tendency towards \~90-100?\n\n\--&gt;   Added thought: Maybe the Aetherium altar can guide you to a city where   tributing a needed alchemy-product their sage will just TELL you the   'ancient knowledge' of what is needed for the Aetherium craft? Or at   least 1/3 of it. For those who prefer quest-following to blind guessing.\n\n\-&gt;   \*) Craft Aetherium, win the game?  OR you can use Aetherium to power   infinite-upgrades on other stuff and the recipe for successfully   crafting aetherium keeps rotating every 10 crafts or so. I dunno; much   potential here.\n\n**==IMPLEMENTATION==**\n\nThe biggest issue here is the choice between a mostly handcrafted experience and a mostly procedurally generated one.\n\nI.) Handcrafting  \nHOW:   I draft a table of all triplet combinations of the 56 core elements   (eg: Fire, Water, Ice, Earth, Electricity, Light/life, Dark/Necrotic,   Air). Each of these is given an appropriate name, (?)pixel-art,   whatever.\n\nPROS:  \n\- With  'Handcrafting' the joy of discovery is  much greater. If I know I'm  trying to make a ""Crackleshard"", I might  think to combine electricity  with ice and then guess at the third  component. That feels like  discovery.If I am just trying to make  ""Ubanox"" then who the hell knows  or cares, what goes into it? Why should  I be any more inclined to try  Red+Blue+Green or Black+Yellow+White?  \nCONS:  \n\- Much more work to set up.\n\n\-   You hit 'combinatorial explosion' issues really fast which can be   unwieldly to code for. 5 elements combined in sets of three make 10   possible combinations. 8 elements make 56. 10 -- 120!. So if I decide to   scale this game up later it will be a real nightmare.  \n\- Severely   limits replay value. Once the combinations are known, the joy of   discovery is gone. For me as the programmer that might be gone all at   once! Still, that DOES leave the finite commodities and trading system   in place so it's not like there's NOTHING to do.  \n\- Much more 'gameable' by an FAQ and such.\n\nII.) Procedural Generation:  \nHOW:   At start of game, use a random-name generator to assign random names  to  each of the 56 'slots' associated with the core elements. Upon   discovery of an element, use a 'rainbow'font to write the name in the   three colors most associated with its creation (eg: Red, cyan,   aqua-blue, olive green, yellow, white/light green, dark-gray/purple,   light-blue to white). To try and lend some alchemical personality to it.  \n\-? t/c: Is it feasible for me to generate believable randomized unique pixel-art at runtime with a 3-color pallette?\n\nPROS:  \n\- Whenever you start a new game, you get a brand new set of possible alchemical combinations to discover!\n\nCONS:  \n\-   The alchemical combinations don't really mean anything. If I see a   storekeeper really wants to buy ""Sqyzorp"" - what should I be farming to   get it?  Why should I care that red-yellow-blue make a ""Sqyzorp""  instead  of a ""Blarfung?"" It may feel like I need to craft everything  before I  can start even making sense of it  \n\-----&gt; The world can  still try  to imbue these random names with meaning. A hint/rumor system  eg: ""The  the Blarfung is made of Ice and water; but not sure what  else."" takes on  even more significance when it's the only  non-resource-depleting  information avenue.  \n\----&gt; Corollary: 56  cities/kingdom, a hint for  each alchemy product available at each of  them? Ironically: the  alchemical product they can tell you about is  probably least valuable  there.\n\n**== Is it fun? ==**  \nI'm not sure.  \nIt definitely seems like it would scratch the 'trader' itch that is fun for me in games like Elite Dangerous, or X3.  \nEven   without procedural generation, the joy of discovery is fun in games   like DQM:Joker, Siralim, Monster crown to see what can be crafted if you   don't already know it; may not be as fun for me as a dev. But the fact   that I've replayed such games in the past suggests it might still be  fun  to play in execution.  \nIf done via procedural logic, then I can potentially get the thrill of discovery every time.  \nThe   existence of numbers you can pay more money to make bigger (eg:   carry-capacity) so that you can then carry MORE so you can sell more so   you can make more is usually a compelling loop.\n\nPut it all together - and especially if the 'minigame' is fun - I could see myself enjoying this game, definitely.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnce  again - I \*do\* think this is realistic for me to program; either within my skill set or close enough. But I don't know that I'm \*excited\*  about playing it and would hate to invest a ton of energy into a boring game. Also haven't sorted out the 'mining minigame' so to speak. Or  whether to have alchemy require a minigame.  \nI'm very much open to feedback that will help with any of these issues. Or of course any feedback you wish to give.  \n\n\n\-AHMAD"

ge2r53,Ideas for FPS game (no multiplayer),"Hello Guys, I have been brainstorming lately, And I would like to hear about what you would love to play and what you wouldn't love to play in an FPS game !, would really appreciate your response."
ge0kyb,"""Werewolf/Mafia"" and ""The Thing"" Style Asymmetric Multiplayer","So my game idea here is taking inspiration from a few different sources:\n\nJohn Carpenter's ""The Thing""\nThe Starcraft 1 custom map ""The Thing""\n""Werewolf/Mafia"" style games\nResident Evil Outbreak and Resident Evil Resistance\n\nHere's the idea..\n\nThe game is asymmetric multiplayer. There are survivors/humans. And one or more (depending on how many players are in game) are the creature in disguise. I picture this being played as a 3rd Person Shooter where players have guns and melee weapons but other styles could work as well.\n\nThe survivors can attack but are weak. They can attack eachother and attack the monster, but would stand no chance against the monsters (in monster form) in 1v1 or 2v1 or possibly more.\n\nThe creature can transform between monster and human form. The creature can kill in either form, but is much stronger in monster form. In human form, the creature has the same stats as any other human.\n\nThe survivor's goal would be to kill the creatures and/or survive a certain time limit and/or accomplish certain objectives (like escape a facility). The creature's goal would be to kill all survivors. Survivor objectives may need to vary based on game balance.\n\nSo the game would start with everyone separated (or possibly together, depending on how the balance of the game turns out). The creature will want to slowly pick off survivors until their numbers are so few that he can reveal as the monster to the remaining survivors and finish them off. This means that strategy will be needed to kill the majority of humans.\n\nNormally in this type of game, the issue is having the group separate. Once everyone groups up, there is no incentive to separate for the survivors. This makes the game very difficult for the creature. To fix this, the creature would also have access to traps around the facility. The creature could trigger traps from an omniscient perspective to force players to separate. Traps could consist of things like gassing, laser rooms, trap doors, walls/ceilings closing in, etc. Anything that forces players to leave a room and go in separate directions. Certain map objectives could also be utilized to force separation if needed for game balance (like hitting multiple switches around the map within a time limit for example)\n\nSurvivors are weak alone and will want to group up asap. So once a survivor is separated, they will want to find other survivors. But being alone with just another survivor or two could be very dangerous because they could be the creature and kill you. So you must be careful about who you trust. Much like other games of this nature, you would use a bit of detective work to figure out who to trust. \n\nThere are more things that could change for game balance. Maybe have proximity voice chat so that players can only talk to close by players. Or maybe not notify all players when a player has died. The players may only find out about deaths by finding the dead player's body while exploring.\n\nI picture the game scenario playing out something like this..\n\n10 players spawn separately. One player is the creature. Everyone heads to the main lobby because there is safety in numbers. While en route to the lobby, the creature finds a player or two and kills them off, or intentionally passes a good opportunity to murder in order to gain trust.\n\nThe players, now in the lobby are discussing a plan for escape and trying to identify the creature. Before they can finish their planning, gas goes off in the lobby forcing players to flee in different directions.\n\nAs you're fleeing, you notice that players A and B left together through a different exit.\n\nYou begin wandering around in search of survivors, objectives and weapons. You find Player A dead while exploring. Your prime suspect is now Player B because he was with Player A.\n\nYou then come across Player B and immediately run. Player B knows you're onto him, so now the hunt is on. Player B must kill you before you tell the rest of the players that Player B is the creature. There could be weapons or environmental hazards that the survivors could utilize to help escape, but the odds are in the favor of the creature.\n\nAnother mechanic could be walkie talkies or a PA system. If the survivor could make it to a PA system and state that he knows Player B is the creature then that could be very helpful to the survivors. But again, how would you know to trust the voice on the PA?\n\nOther mechanics that could exist is that the creature could potentially transform into the exact player model of other survivors, or survivors he has killed. This would further increase the distrust among the group. Depending on the complexity and balance of the game, there could be different creatures to play as with different abilities. \n\nAn important distinction is that only those who actually are alive when the game ends ""win"". So survivors who were killed because they were believed to be the creature or survivors who were killed by the creature will not get credit for a win. This is important because it will force the survivors to be much more considerate when deciding who to kill and will make dying much harsher. There should also be in game rewards for wins, like a ranking system, in game currency for cosmetics and other unlockables. Having wins be important will create for some very cool ""hero"" moments. Imagine a survivor is seconds away from the exit and decides to turn back to save an endangered friend he made at the beginning of the game because he knows the friend needs this win.\n\nThe survivors could have very cool hero moments when cooperating properly. Players could potentially hold doors shut temporarily to delay the creature getting into a room. Or shoot flares/flashbangs to stun the monster and help a player escape. Or imagine an ""Indiana Jones"" type scenario where a friend is running down the hall from the monster, calling for help. A nearby survivor hears him and sees him getting chased. The survivor then runs up to a lever and times it just right so that a heavy metal door closes, locking the monster out, just as the friend is crossing the threshold of the door.\n\nI could go on forever about the possibilities of this game but I don't want the core ideas to get lost in a wall of text. Anyway, let me know your thoughts! I'd be happy to get into more mechanics that could exist or other ways the game could be balanced."

gdvzns,SIDEARM,"A 1v1 shooter game based in a map crowded with people.\n\nSIDEARM pits two agents against each other in that very map, sent there only with a task to eliminate the other.\n\nThe twist that they're not sure who their target looks like.\n\nArmed with only a pistol, a weapon they can conceal, and a single piece of tactical equipment. The agents must blend in with the crowd while attempting to locate their enemy, Agents can opt to use alternate routes to gain vantage points with a larger field of view at the risk of being spotted if the deed is not executed well. An agents heartbeat will beat faster as they close the space between each other, but can only be heard once in a while\n\nWhen an Agent locates thier target, they can draw their pistol to fire at his adversary, but its not long before the people around see the pistol, prompting them to back off, and eventually run. Firing a pistol instanly causes the masses to flee the area.\n\nEventually, the crowd flees, leaving the two agents to face off in a shoot out, using their equipment to switch positions or disorient the other.\n\nAfter a minute or so, the police arrive and try to intervene, making the battle more intense, forcing the agents to end the bout faster.\n\nOnly one can leave victorious.\n\n\n\nWell, couldn't you just gun down a group of people and hopefully hit your opponent?\n\nHarming or Killing innocents will deduct your score, not just a small amount though, killing just a few can cause you more points than you can win a round with, forcing agents to be more careful with their weapons.\n\nThe same for the police which show up in the endgame, it is adviced to hide and evade them instead of shooting, unless an agent is backed against to corner.\n\n\nSIDEARM plays on a few rounds, on a score based scheme. Agents have different appearances every round, only their movements can be used as evidence to locate adversaries.\n\nPistols are hard to control, and can be fired blindly over cover at a lower accuracy. Different pistols can be used, each with their own strenghs, and their own tradeoffs.\n\nHowever, guns are not born equal, using weaker guns can grant a slight increase in score to make winning easier. Score aside from elimination can be acquired by doing small missions, but you'll look suspiscious doing so and should be attempted to make up for mistakes or and opponent winning with weaker weapons.\n\nThis is all the ideas i have at the moment, do suggest anything in the comments to add onto this or balance the game :)"

gdvk2e,Time travel in an RTS,"1) What is this post about\n\n2)My basic vision for the game\n\n3) Time travel mechanics\n\n4) Example of a mission  (AAR report)\n\n5) Some additional time gimmick ideas\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) What is this post about:\n\nMy post is mostly about how you could implement a time travel mechanic in an RTS environment and that is what I will mostly be focusing on. \n\n2)My basic vision for the game:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n""AI war"" like starting scenario: Strong AI enemy, weak player.\n\nPlayer has ""Command and Conquer 1"" style mechanics.\n\nThe game is happening on a planet. (I will be imagining a human vs insects scenario)\n\nPlayers victory is impossible without the use of the time machine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3) Time travel mechanics:\n\nThe time machine is a building with witch you start the mission.\n\nTo use the time machine you need special mineral (Timetravelium) of witch there is not a lot of on the map. (enough for few uses only)\n\nTimetravelium has the quirk that it disappears from time once it gets used, so you can't travel back in time and harvest the same Timetravelium that you use to get there in the first place.\n\nTime travel will consist of sending units/resources/research back into time to increase your chances of beating the enemy.\n\nWhen you activate the time machine the game pauses and you will see a replay like screen where you can pick the time to where you want to time travel. Only difference between this screen and the real reply screen (if you decide to have one) is that when you decide to time travel for the second time you wont see the time between your first use of time travel and the point to which you time travelled. In other words you will only see the newest timeline.\n\nThe way your units time travel is that you will have to put them into the time machine (like you would into a transport), after the time travel you will just disembark them. Resources would be transported automatically (imagine the time machine being a storage unit like most main buildings are in RTS's). When you return in time your current resources will be added to the resources you had in the past.\n\nThe cost of Timetravelium can be 1 per trip or you can base it on the time travelled and the amount of units you take with you.\n\n4) \n\nHere I will demonstrate what strategic decision making will time travel add to a game\n\nI have my main base at the bottom of the map. The top is saturated with enemy hives. My objective is to save as many civilian houses (imagine ""Into the breach"") from destruction before we get saved by a nuclear strike that will destroy the enemy hive in 20 minutes. I see that my base has a nice reserve of Generic minerals, but just one piece of Timetravelium. My base is on the high ground so it is easy to defend unlike the flat lands where the civilians reside. \n\nFor the first timeline I decide to bunker up in my base. The civilians prove as a nice distraction for the insects so I have enough time to build up my defences. I spam units until my defences are about to break then I retreat my forces into the time machine and activate it. One Timetravelium will only get me 5 minutes back in time, that is why i didn't make better defences and spammed units instead, I only needed them to last for a few minutes so I could return right to the start of the mission before the civilians died.\n\nNow that I have actual fighting units before the enemy even starts his attack, I can establish a defensive perimeter in between the civilians  and the insect hive. I send my units and start building more defensive walls and turrets. This will move will not only ensure that I have the defenders advantage in this fight, but I will also be able to safely harvest from the Generic mineral and Timetravelium deposits in the middle of the map. I am just chilling for 15 minutes, but then tragedy strikes!\n\nI have forgotten to build anti air units and now the enemy is deleting my units from existence without any retaliation. I start panicking and before the situation can get any worse I decide to spend my Timetravelium that I just harvested to go back by 5 minutes again to prepare myself against this onslaught.\n\nThis time I am prepared for such a surprise and the last enemy offensive gets easily crushed.\n\nMy final score for this mission is 12. \[ +22 points for defended civilians, -10 for minutes time travelled\]\n\n5) Some additional time gimmick ideas\n\nYou can have terrain change over time: Earth quake cuts off a part of a map by creating a canyon.\n\nIf the past version of one of your units dies the future one dies as well (this NOT happening would be fine according to the rules of this kind of time travel that I am using)\n\nTime travel creates anomalies that deal damage.\n\nFINALE\n\nAs you can see to minimize turteling I created a scoring system that discourage time travel. You can also put Timetravelium in a small enemy hive to encourage conflict.\n\nI know that this can work. StarCraft 2 already allows you to jump into a replay and play from a specific point in time. \n\nWhat do you think of my idea lads? I got this idea years ago so I decided that I would put it up here."

You then do whatever you want. There would be things you could place down.\n\nTrees:  Drop mangos. They are needed to keep the blobs alive. One mango means the blob will live to the next day. Two means they multiply. Three means they get bigger. When they are bigger they can eat other blobs. Trees also drop wood, which they need to keep warm. They save the wood but need at least three when they go to bed. \n\nRocks:  They drop stone. Stone is needed to make tools and houses. Tools let them chop down trees and mine rocks faster. Houses let them save mangos and wood. Up to three blobs can live in a house. \n\nCaves:  Blobs will have a 50% chance of walking in a cave if they walk by one. If they go in they have a 50% chance to live and bring out a lot of stone, but they also have a 50% chance to die. \n\nThen there would be multiple types of blobs with different traits, each having a different color.\n\nThe average blob: Acts normal and just does the goal set for that trait. Color: blue\n\nThe fast blob: Much faster and has a higher rate of surviving caves, but needs two food to survive everyday because they use more energy. Color: yellow\n\nThe rude blob: They will steal mangos, wood, and stone from other blobs, but the other blobs won't let them into their houses and run away from them. Color: red\n\nThe brave blob: They will walk into every cave they see and don't run away from rude blobs. They also let them into their home. Color: purple\n\nThe scared blob: They never walk into caves and run even faster from rude blobs. They sometimes follow the brave blobs and even give them things. Color: green\n\nThe playful blob: They don't do as much work but can convince other blobs to go into caves with them and will sometimes play with baby blobs. Color: orange\n\nWhen blobs reproduce the new blob starts out as a baby. They will follow their parent for the first few days, but as it becomes an adult it will stop gradually. They can't get mangos or wood or stone but need 2 food to stay alive and can't reproduce. \n\nWhen blobs create up to 5 houses in a area it is a town. Blobs will be nice to the people in the same town and sometimes even get them supplies. When there are 10 houses in a area they will be a city. Blobs that are 5 houses away from each other will be nice to each other but don't care for people farther than that. Anymore houses are a state. \n\nThere is a 10% chance for parents to abandon their children. They have a 50% chance to die and a 50% chance to learn to grab resources to stay alive. When they grow up they have a 10% chance to get a criminal blob. They steal from other blobs and sometimes kill them. Other blobs can have this happen but it's a 5% chance. Blobs will not be afraid of a criminal until they see them commit a crime.\n\nAll blobs have 5 hp. When hit by a criminal or rude blob they will lose 1 hp. They will begin running as soon as they get hit. When they go underwater they begin to lose 1 hp every 2 seconds unless someone saves them or their head is out of it. When a blob dies another blob will bury them unless a rude blob or a criminal finds them. They will throw them into a pool of water if they are rude, and bring them into their house if they are a criminal.\n\nThere would be god abilities as well. The normal ai of a blob is to eat, get wood, and reproduce, but you can lower and raise these stats. You could also give one object a disease. When a blob interacts with the infected object they will not know. They will infect others when they get near, and depending on how deadly you have it set as, it can simply not let them work for a while, or it could start killing them the moment they infect someone else. There would then be blob consumers. They would look spherical sponges and eat all slimes it sees.\n\nAchievements:\n\nMayor: Make a town, city, or state.\n\nMegalomaniac: Have 1000 blobs die in a experiment.\n\nIn the jungle: Spawn 100 trees. \n\nUnlucky: Spawn a blob over a water pool or near a blob consumer.\n\nMad scientist: Fill up all the experiment slots. \n\nMixed bag: Have one if every type of blob in a experiment. (Including criminals and babies even though you can't spawn them.)"
gdmuaf,A vr battle royale with realistic physics and interactive environments.,"Imagine how cool it would be if something like this happened. I just want you guys to envision it. You jump out of a plane and land (no parachute since something like that would be annoying without a hotkey) on the ground. You quickly snatch a handgun and book it for the nearest building. Once inside, you grab a barrel and slowly pull it to the door. You scrounge the place in search for a better gun, and find an AR-15, but as soon as you find it you can hear the sound of glass shattering in another room. You get close to the center of the disturbance and find someone sneaking in. They try to be fast, but their body armor makes them noisy because of their quick movement and slows them down. You walk slowly, knowing that you may alert them to your presence. You peek around the corner and fire a few shots to the head (body armor won't do much for that). They collapse to the floor and you grab their body, snatching what they had to loot their corpse. You grab the body armor and put it on. Then, when you look up, you see what they were eyeing when they broke in. A helmet with thermal vision. You quickly put it on and the world turns green. You then decide that it would be a good idea to leave, especially considering the fact the gas is closing in when you check the map on your watch. You head for the zone, but your clunky armor is slowing you down. That's when you spot the motorcycle. You get on the motorcycle and start to move to the zone by thrusting the engines. When you make it to the zone, you hop off the motorcycle, knowing that an enemy could trail you if you made too much noise. You hear a gunshot and quick footsteps running away. The player count on your watch goes down by 1. You sneak over and find a sniper. You grab the sniper and run for the trees. You climb all the way to the top before laying on your stomach to get a good view. You spot a player and fire, hitting the shot and killing them. A support package nearby appears, and you know that its just you and 2 other people, so you go for it. You find a crowbar in a nearby cabin and smash the box to pieces. You get some performance modifiers (supressors, scopes, etc) and apply them manually to your gun, tightening the suppressor around the hammer of your sniper and attaching the scope to your AR-15, seeing as your sniper already has a scope. You spot someone hiding in a building with your scope, but they move too much to be able to get a clear shot. You make a mad dash for your house, but stop midway to recover stamina. You check your watch to find that there's only one player remaining! You run for the house, but knowing that you should always have the element of surprise, you squeeze yourself through the door while moving it as little as possible. You find a chair by the door and pull one last trick to win. The player has positioned themselves in the corner of a room, waiting for them to pop in so they can be killed. You can see them hiding behind the door and so you decide to take advantage of that. You push the door slightly open, pull the pin on your grenade, and quickly throw it on the floor. You run out and grab a chair, using all of your stamina to quickly pull it across the room to use as a blockade for the door. You block off the door and you hear the grenade explode. It explodes, but you realize that the player isn't dead, but rather lost their armor. They try and break free while you look for something to kill them with. They're about to break through when you spot your key to victory: a claymore. Only problem is, it's guarding a door. You hug the wall of the building and deactivate the claymore from behind. You can hear them slamming the door, but luckily you reach it moments before they breakthrough. You quickly place the claymore and hide in the house. They get hit and barely tank the shot. They retreat back and block the door themselves. You can hear the sound of a medical kit being unzipped and used. You push and push, and eventually, embarrassingly, the blockade they used tips over, hitting them and dealing the final blow. You've won, and you feel great. You take off the headset, take a breather, grab some water, and get ready to play again. \n\nIf anyone somehow makes something like this, I'd appreciate it if you credited me somewhere where it can be seen fairly easily."
