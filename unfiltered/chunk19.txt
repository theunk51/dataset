agr8qf,The Most Absurd Idea You'll Ever Read,"Now, I'm writing this with the knowledge that it could even take a decade for this type of game to even be plausible, and in fact, it could be argued it borders not being a game at all. That being said, I love this idea with a passion by its sheer concept alone. I'll call it Promethia for this.\n\nPromethia is a game designed for a very small group of people, somewhere from four to eight people. It's a virtual reality role-playing video game meant to be played much like Dungeons &amp; Dragons, but in a video game. However, this game is only designed for one group. Ever. That group of people may as well have to audition it's such a specific roll. Each player is given a briefing of the lore of the game space (classic fantasy, space opera, whatever it is.) From there, the players can make any character they want, discussing with each other in how they plan to make a character. Based on the character and the player, each person is given a single ability, which I'd think of equivalent to a superpower. An example could be the ability to change the state of water at will in the game world. Note this single ability has many uses for combat, puzzles &amp; many other situations. \n\nOnce done working with the players to create a group of protagonists, these will be the only characters playable. But each will be unique in how they interact with the world around them, their gameplay style, etc. Hold out for a sec, I'm going somewhere with this idea. The original players and the game developers, once done with designing most the game, will buy out a large space where they will test the virtual reality space. Finally, the first day of launch. \n\nThis is D&amp;D, the TV show. Livestreams every Friday 2-6.\n\nYep. You take the single team of players, put them in a virtual realty set, and then improv your way to glory. Is it plausible? No. But would it be cool? For sure. It's not exactly D&amp;D, to make it feasible as a show it needs a visually coherent design which conveys the world. Plus, the reason I made the characters have their own unique abilities is so that people can easily identify them and know their ability set when walking into a situation, and then the game slowly could become more complex as they explore the world. Think like the Avatar, slowly pushing limits of how they can use their abilities.\n\nThere's something so special about shows like Critical Role in that they have a special connection from the characters to their players. However, it falls short in that it is too much content, and at too slow a pace, for most people. I think this would be the most impractical and expensive way to do it, but some way to make the idea of improv storytelling blend into high-quality show production. \n\nI still consider this a game because the game exists, its just not for public use.\n\nOh, one last thing - Yes, this would be a financial disaster. Only a billionaire could make this game without ruining everyone on the team."
agq2jc,"A FPS Horde Defense game, Starring different characters from different time periods, and around the world.","It's like Mann vs Machine from TF2, but starring many made up characters from history. As for a story, it would not have a heavy emphasis, but I have an idea. A scientist from the future invents the first time machine. He uses it as a test subject, and travels to many different periods. As he is doing this, it gets the attention of an alien race which is not pleased with humans knowing how to time travel. They send armies of aliens to fight this scientist, and destroy the technology. The scientist is set off course, and unexpectedly is sent to Feudal Japan.

agjnkx,"A real life time based Fantasy RPG mixed with MMO and Battle Royale elements, hear me out","Ok so before you write off ""ooh it's a battle royale"" it's really not but kinda, let me explain. \n\nYou start the game by making your character however you like, like an MMO, but the servers are locked on month time basis. Everyone has to start on the same day, but there are multiple servers to offset so people can just hop in whenever. It's supposed to be team oriented, but you CAN play solo. You drop into a massive world with tiered zones starting from outside the edge of the map you arrive on the beaches, this zone is level 1-25, you level your character as a normal MMO, questing, doing dungeons, gathering gear and equipment up to level 25, this goes on for a week, then the massive wall guarding zone 2 gates drop, levels 26-50 are now available as is zone 2, new area opens more towards the center of the map, you have new enemies new quests, new gear, the entire thing is open PvP btw, so going in as a team makes the most sense, though of course there will always be the solo god. Another week passes, the 3rd zone opens, levels 51-75, the last phase week passes, the final zone opens, levels 76-100, then finally after that the FINAL gates open to a huge tower of babyl type of thing with bosses to the top, first team/player to clear it wins. These zones are level blocked so if you join late you could still win if you worked your ass off"
agh07p,Open world detective game.,"A first person open world game that takes place in a small town or county. You play a private detective searching for a missing person. \n\nYour mission would start out simple enough, find so and so, they were last spotted in this small town. As you poke around the town, asking questions and searching for clues, you start to learn about the town’s many dark secrets and hidden criminal factions. How you interact with these factions would be up to you. A request for information might require a favor from you that would deepen your involvement with certain characters for better or worse. The scope of the mystery / investigation would greatly expand as you progress further into the story. Your relationship with the town and your involvement with certain characters will also grow and develop dynamically. As this happens, the seriousness, intensity, severity of situations and decisions will also increase. \n\nTo make the game as intense and engaging as possible, a one life mechanic would be in effect. Life threatening situations would be few and somewhat far between depending on the choices you make, but if you die or get arrested you would have to start the game over. \n\nThe idea behind the game is that it is completely non linear. How you interact with the game dictates the information you receive and the situations presented to you. A dynamic, context sensitive dialogue tree would be employed to make interactions with Npc’s realistic. What questions and how you ask those question will dictate the kinds of information you receive. Also, the information you reveal to npc's is just as important as the info they reveal to you. \n\n Information between npc’s would have to be shared in real time in order to make things like eavesdropping and surveillance possible. Everything npc’s do for that matter, would have to occur in real time. If someone decides to have you followed, they would call some thugs and tell them to follow you , those thugs would then contact people around the town who may have seen you. Once they lock in on your position (the hotel your staying at, for example) they would then drive to that hotel and monitor your actions. They may follow you throughout the day. This would give the observant player the opportunity to notice they are being followed and react accordingly. \n\nA game like this would require a complex and advanced npc schedule system. Most if not all Npc’s would have a daily and weekly routine. If you interfere with their routine, npc’s would have the ability to adapt wherever necessary. In order for information such as rumors to circulate throughout the community, a complex web of relationships between npc’s would have to be created so that all npc’s would either know each other or know someone that knows someone else. Basically, a game version of five degrees of separation. \n\nSome examples of how this game would play:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. The clues you leave behind would be just as important and the clues you find. For example, gloves are required if you don't want to leave fingerprints, your shoes will track blood and spent shell casings will linger at the scene. Anything illegal that you might do will need to be covered up otherwise police or criminals will track you down.\n\n 2. You break into someone’s house and kill them. Maybe the neighbors heard the gunshot and called the police, giving you limited time to flee the scene. Maybe the body isn’t discovered until days later when a loved one decides to check on the person. Or, maybe nobody discovers the body and the crime scene is left as is for the remainder of the game. \n\n3. Maybe you go to someones house to interrogate them. As you approach the front door you notice the lock is smashed. You enter and find the person dead. At this point it would be up to you to find any clues about the deceased person with zero hints from the game. Most if not all objects can be interacted with and examined closely. You can take pictures with your cell phone and notes with your notepad. Neighbors can be interviewed, etc. \n\n4. You're interviewing someone and they leave to use the restroom for a moment. While they’re away you decide to search their desk for clues. Perhaps you find their diary or something else useful. Maybe you look through their phone for info, etc. Maybe you decide to follow them and monitor their actions. Maybe you break into their house for clues after they leave for work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA slight survival mechanic would be employed. If you go to long without food or sleep your character will act accordingly. Your reaction time when driving or firing your weapon might be affected, for example. Perhaps your options on the dialogue tree are limited because your character isn't thinking clearly. \n\nThe game should be very difficult with zero hand holding. The game would not provide the player with any hints or strategies. \n\nBecause the game is so dynamic, it would be near impossible to play the game the same way twice or to have two identical play experiences. \n\nI imagine the game opening in a diner at night, a meeting between you and a man hiring you to find his missing daughter. You are briefed on the situation and given some small bits of info. Maybe a couple names or a specific location. After that you would drive to the town. Along the drive, circumstances would be presented that would act as a simple tutorial to explain the basic game mechanics to the player. After that, you arrive in the town and the rest is up to you.

agcy00,An open world game set in a prison with RPG elements,"Sort of like a mix between The Escapists and GTA, (With a bit of Bully thrown in too) you could do stuff like join or even form your own prison gang, do favours for other inmates, lose or gain favour with certain inmates depending on what you do.\n\nAt the start you pick your character, you choose the characters name, what crime(s) they did, what they look like and there skill set.\n\nYou can get more time or get in trouble if you do more illegal activities such as being caugt smuggling in items like drugs, alcohol, phones or cigarettes, killing or beating up other inmates (or guards), stealing, or being caught trying to escape, although you have to be caught doing these things in order to get into trouble.\n\nCertain inmates will judge you based on what crime(s) you're in for, some might respect you for what you've done, others will fear you and others still will hate you for what you've done. \n\nIf you see another inmate doing an illegal activity you can help them, though if you get caught you'll get in trouble just as if you were doing said activity yourself, but if you don't the other inmate might reward you or help you out later, you can also tell one of the guards, but this will get you reputation as a snitch, meaning most inmates won't like you or ask you for favours unless you build your reputation back up, but the upside to this would be that you will get a good among the guards and you will get some time taken off of your sentence."
agcahv,''Disrecommend'' (Dark/Horror/Sexually-Possessed/Suicidal Game Idea),"Name Of The Game: Disrecommend\n\nStory/Game Moral: This is very deep to me, so I won't go in too much detail. Here's a summary; boy starts dating a girl, who later kills herself due to the boy treating her bad. She haunts him at night, he got insomnia because of her. He never sleeps and starts taking random pills to treat this, but it doesn't stop anything &amp; just makes it worse. The guy is very antisocial, and doesn't talk to anyone about this. He starts dating other girls, which makes the dead girlfriend/wife even ''worse'' (This is where I got the title ''Disrecommend'' since dating someone else is disrecommended, plus it has a dark vibe to it) and she starts hurting the guy at night (Sexually, scratches, abuses him) till they breakup and later he finds out every girl he has been has cheated on him, which makes him feel worse. The dead girl cheated on the guy on the last day of her being alive, so the guy is mentally asexual and isn't allowed to have anything sexual with other girls since he doesn't like the thought of it. Later, he goes mental. He starts being sexual on purpose to punish himself, it's like self-harm in a way. The end of the story is basically the guy killing himself. I hope you guys like the idea, I really disrecommend games that aren't unique."

ag9wys,The Soul System from CV:Dawn of Sorrow in a 3D RPG,"**Back in 2005**\n\nDoes anyone remember the soul system from Castle Vania: Dawn of sorrow ? Basically, every single enemy in existance could drop its own soul alongside 0-2 item drops. These souls could be used by the player to mimic certain attacks/abilities/stats from the individual enemy (Kill a Skeleton, get its soul, be able to throw bones with the cost of Mana) or to upgrade your sword into that enemies sword.  \n\n\n**The feature presented in nowadays RPGs** \n\nThis mechanic has infinite potential, yet I have never seen it in a new game. Especially since 3D games were revolutionalized since then, you could have a lot more possibilities with movement based souls which would make exploration extremely versatile (You could fly, slide, morph into animals, the possibilities are infinite because of third dimension) and combat could also be enhanced greatly. For example by implementing this in a Dark Souls gameplay kind of game (Controller based movement, Rolls, Blocking, Parries, right/left hand weapon, slow or fast weapons, HP, Stamina, Magic, Poise) you could basically add infinite build customization to an already very indepth combat system.    \n\n\n**What it could mean for an RPG**\n\n**Story:** This feature could be the base of an entire Story as well, make the protagonist someone from a shaman race that always extracted power from other creatures souls or make it more subtle and the protagonist only heired a strange artifact from his grandma which started glowing when he stepped on a bug by accident or something, you can turn this basic concept into such a twisted story so easily.  \n**Gameplay:** The same goes for the gameplay, this could turn into such an amazing PvP game, imagine defeating a monster mole, then literally being able to use the move ""dig"" from pokemon in a medieval like person vs person fight, yet again, you can make so much out of this basic forgotten concept, this was just one example.  \n**PVE:** Everybody knows that defeating a boss with skill after a failing for a few minutes can feel extremely rewarding but that feeling drops, once you realize that from that boss, all you earned is some weird magic spell that you well never use since you are playing as a knight but this changes with this system as you could give souls several possible transformations: You can make it act as a magic spell(A summonable familiar, a direct attack or a passive buff), an upgrade to a weapon or an upgrade to armor, all 3 options can exist simultaneously so boss fights would be rewarding like never before. This also makes for a lot of possible weapon and armor design, imagine a spectral sword that penetrates only the soul of an enemy, ignoring its armor, thus dealing more damage to certain enemies but decreasing the chance of obtaining its soul since you are damaging that soul directly, the ability to add situational advantages, thus adding versatility to combat and exploration is really easy.   \n\n\nIt's honestly just an amazing mechanic that can be the foundation of any game, especially by adding more depth to armor sets, level up customization and adding a stamina meter which wasnt present in Castle Vania: Dawn of Sorrow, you can really turn a basic concept into your own amazing game."
ag9tq3,We Are Venom,"We Are Venom would be a game where you control the human side of the dangerous duo known as Venom. The Symbiote is controlled by a highly advanced, learning AI, with it’s own personality and reactions to you.\n\nBased on the actions and dialogue of the player, the symbiote will have varying levels of obedience and known skills. For example, acting against it’s desires will lower obedience and it may take you over to do what it wants or even leave.\n\nIt may learn certain skills and tendencies that you have in order to work well together. Attempting a sharp turn by anchoring the symbiote to a building or post may have it learn to do so automatically.\n\nJust like their nemesis, Spider-Man, Venom’s game will be a mostly open world with a general storyline. However, how you treat the symbiote and how it likes you may greatly influence the storyline.\n\nThe main storyline could have the symbiote attempting to get revenge on Spider-Man, and how you react. Maybe you cooperate, maybe you attempt to convince it to forgive him, and maybe you break up over the revenge fantasy.\n\nDifferent symbiotes can be playable. Unlocking the Carnage symbiote can be done as an achievement by going on a murder rampage as Venom. Toxin might be earned by making a stable “play-time” compromise as Carnage. There can be an entire library of playable symbiote partners, each with their own stories, potentially.\n\nOf course, relationship with various factions can vary. Being sufficiently friendly may earn vigilante status where the police are less likely to attack you on sight. Spider-Man may be his own faction, as well as potentially Kingpin’s company, and more.\n\nLearn to share control. Venom is not 1 person. Venom is 2. **We** are Venom."
ag8rs5,Idea for a pvp fantasy adventure/ arena game with pve elements.,"First you create a character just like how most mmos start off.(this is not an mmo)\n Choose race, alignment, faction/or occupation... and some starting gear\n Unlike most every other arena game there isn't the staight foward team death match objective of most kills wins. Instead, race, alignment and faction/occupation will determine a players objectives. Good alignment opposes evil. The elf and goblin races are enemies etc. The Barbarians faction just want to raid the order faction. The good mage faction wants the same power crystals the evil mage faction wants. The aventurer faction wants to kill powerful monster mobs/bosses to farm loot... and thieves want to steal from them. But scouts are good at tracking thieves. Assassins get contracted to assassinate targets while a guard player protect that target.\n\nPut all these unique objectives into a variety of dungeon/wilderness style maps with random monster,loot, traps and secret doors etc. and let the adventure begin. \n\nPlayers earn rewards by collecting loot, completing objectives and escaping the dungeon area. \n\nAfter a successful match players can keep treasure found or turn it into more points. Points can be used to create new equipment and skills for the next match.\n\nThis is just brainstorming a few ideas to create a fast pace, new and different kind of rpg dungeon experience. "

ag3xp2,Superman - Manual Transmission,"I love comic books and I drive a stick shift. I've spent a lot of time, while driving my stick shift, thinking about what would make a good Superman game.\n\n**Concept:**\nA Superman game which featured ""shifting gears"" as the central superpower mechanic (pun intended) coupled with a ""moral synchronization"" life system. Being Superman is a plate-spinning act, not one of might.\n\n**Gameplay:**\nAt the most basic level, you play in a set area in which threats and assets randomly appear and disappear. You must protect as many of the assets as you can as long as you can. ([Screencap of a super shitty version I made in GameMaker featuring heat vision](https://i.imgur.com/OZSMUQW.png)) If you fail to protect the assets, excessively harm the assets, or deal with the threats too forcefully, you lose.\n\n**Superpower Mechanic:**\nShifting Gears for superpowers would portray the TRUE challenge of being Superman: [control.](https://youtu.be/Cl_5UwS57X8?t=51)  Super speed, for example. If you move too slow, you can't protect civilians from bullets, but if you move too fast and bump into someone, they get hurt.\n\n**Life System:**\nMoral Synchronization would work like Assassin's Creed desynchronization. The more stuff you do out of character (e.g. hurting civilians, collateral damage, lethal force), the less Superman-like you are, and if you pull a full Face-Heel-Turn, you ""lose.""\n\n**Platforms:**\nA simple version like the one I tried to make (with a LOT of polish) would be fun even on a browser, mobile, or arcade platform. But like I said before, these concepts could be greatly extrapolated.\n\n**Developmental Complexity:**\nI tagged this as ""Beginner"" because even I, someone with no programming or GameMaker studio experience, made a (imo) fun, playable version inside of two weeks. More experience and know-how would only add to it.\n\nIf you use these ideas and make a game, I WANT TO PLAY PLEASE. And a shout-out would be pretty dope. If you've got questions about my shitty GameMaker version, ask away!"
ag20nl,A game like Spider-Man (2018) but with Thor,"I love the combat in the newest Spider-Man game, almost as much as how fun and easy it is to get around the map. I think that if a game similar to this, but with Thor would be a big hit. He’s the God of Thunder, and there are so many different moves the developer could incorporate. Swinging that hammer around and doing combos/AOE attacks would be awesome, and he has multiple ways of getting around easily, which would be perfect for a free-roam world. "

afzbrl,Highly customizable Star Wars based RPG,"The idea consists of the following: the player creates a character of his/her choice (perhaps like Skyrim, except that the non-human races are iconic Star Wars species), and travels from galaxy to galaxy to defeat the antogonist. There would be many companions with customizable attire and equipment. The combat would be very similar to that of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, which would be a time based, turn based (quick pace) combat system. The player’s party would be a maximum of four characters. There could be a few base droid companions, and more could be created by the player (similar to the Automatron robot workbench from Fallout 4). The player could select a base droid model (Ex: Protocol Droid; astromech droid). The droid’s model could be selected with reference pictures beside each model. With some droids, model versions could be combined to create a new droid (Ex: taking a piece from an R2 Droid and attaching it to an R4 model), or even combining droid parts to form a completely different droid. There would be a story that the player would follow, and their choices affect the ending of the game. The player could choose which social class to start their adventure as (Ex: Trader, slave, jedi, soldier of the republic). Perhaps the game would be set just after the Star Wars prequels, and any class that the player choses allows him or her to become a jedi, although it wouldn’t be mandatory to become one. The soundtrack would take from the films, in addition to sound affects. The player could chose which planet/galaxy to travel to, with all galaxies available from the start of the game. The player could also chose custom attire, even if it is lore breaking to own. Weapons would be highly customizable as well. The character could purchase a certain amount of customizable ships, and is given a complimentary ship after a certain quest is completed. I suppose the idea is most comparable to Skyrim, Fallout 4, and Grand Theft Auto 5. "
afya1s,"A space based VR game, that is essentially a engine based ""source"" game, like G-Mod, But with Unreal engine","Essentially the game is released, its pretty bare bones, but the community can make mods, and modpacks for servers. Occasionally if a mod is very popular it gets added to the game. Its based in Space, like imagine a world like ""The Expanse"" where you can tour the galaxy, but you can build your own ship for pretty much free, or maybe there can be roleplay servers on top of creative servers its all up to whoever the host of the server is. Gravity actually works in the game, if your ship isnt moving or your gravity generators are off, your in 0G when your in space. Objects not secured in your inventory, or a locker on the ship will be floating around. If you turn on your thrusters, gravity will start sending things back. You can go on EVA, and use a RCS jetpack, or magboots to walk around if you dont feel adventurous. Thats the core of the game anyway. Just a very accurate space based VR game. People can make gamemodes like Ship Fights, roleplay servers could be formed and people can make factions, like earth is one faction, mars is an other. People can set up bases anywere if they can afford to terraform it. Or space freighter Alien, An alien hunts down all the players on a ship. It can go on for a long time, The alien can come with you if you escape in a spare ship that was docked. Then another server gets ""infected"". You pretty much join a new lobby and the alien is with you.\n\nThere could be hidden easter eggs anywhere. Like if someone builds a ship that can sustain the suns deadly burn, and can build a base on the surface of the sun, of course that can happen. Its a giant space sandbox game, If you can't build anywhere and on anything then whats the points? It could have the destruction level of Space Engineers, but have it optimized in some way so that things arn't laggy. For example each sector of space is a different server. While your going from sector to sector it loads while you are in transit. \n\nBut the idea of a Sandbox Space VR game is very promising, atleast to me. "

aft2pj,A FPS where you use Grenades instead of Guns,"Think of a Super Smash Bros FPS. It’s a 3v3 on fully destructible and cartoonish maps. There’s no guns, just different types of grenades.

Unless you get stunned.\n\nInstead of guns, they’ve been replaced by stunners. Which mimic the style of guns as a wrist-mounted device. You can blast a foe with it to raise their Shock level. At 100%, they’ll go into a stunned state for a few seconds. Giving a good chance for you to toss a deadly grenade in. \n\nDifferent characters can equip different stunners and have specialized abilities.

afsxaa,I need some ideas for 2-d platformer movement,"I am a big fan of 2-d platformers. I recently played through Celeste, I speedrun Super Mario World, etc. I want to work on a project and figured that a nice 2-d platformer would be a great thing to work on. Currently, I just want to work on the physics, the player movement, possibly enemies. Playing through Celeste I loved how the dashes opened up so many creative ways to play, you could dash into the ground, jump and maintain your momentum, jump around obstacles, etc. I like how the wall climbing works, and overall it is an incredibly polished game. There are some of the interactive elements that I never got a full feel for (the feather for example). On top of this you are able to make difficult levels by making rooms small, and respawn times quick. As for ideas from Super Mario World, I enjoy how solid the physics on that feel. I like that you have the option to run, or walk; I like how the cape mechanics work, I like how the setup and bouncing off of enemies can work. I want to take some elements from both. I want to have some enemies (simple ones that do not feel extremely random), I want to have some permanent upgrades throughout the game. I want to have small but difficult rooms that incorporate all aspects of movement available to the player. My big question is what forms of movement would you like to see in a 2-d platformer? I don't want to straight up copy Celeste's movement, and I want to incorporate enemy encounters. Any thoughts?"
afsk1b,Cartoony vehicle team based game,"A game that has warthunder like controls of tanks, planes, and warships but rather than being a grind fest focuses more on team tactics and plays.\n\nEach match will involve all aspects of vehicles to win the battle whether through an objective or not.\n\nThe games aesthetic would be simple and more like a polygonal game with simple textures and a bright palette of both the game world and projectiles and effects.\n\nThere could also be customization of ships that focuses on players designing builds for their ships rather than grinding the levels to unlock better stuff. This meaning players can choose a wide range of different options for their vehicles that have direct consequences aswell as bonuses\n\nFor example players could choose the size of a gun on a tank by spending points on it however with the amount of points left would have to choose between speed and armour\n\nPlanes and ships could follow the similar rule\n\nPlayers would create decks with multiple combinations of vehicles for play\n\nAlso although the gameplay may have realism aka piercing and ricochet physics the vehicles themselves would be simple limiting the players to 3 different sizes and 3 options per area such as (SMALL, MEDIUM, LARGE) and (CANNON, HOWITZER, MACHINE GUN)\n\nIf all else i would like to think these mechanics could work for other games\n\nPlease criticise"

afnj0e,Asymmetrical Multiplayer Tremors game,"I just noticed they’re still making Tremors movies. While watching the latest I had an idea for a multi-phase asymmetrical multiplayer game. The game takes place in the 80’s in some dusty southwest town like the first movie.\n\nIf you haven’t seen the movie then let me break down how a typical match plays out. You’ve got 14 citizen players, and 1 Graboid. The citizens will need to work together to avoid being eaten, gather supplies to fix a broken tractor, as well as explosives to either kill or deter the graboid. All citizens have the same abilities, you can pick up/throw items, sprint, jump, and climb. Every citizen is also able to use a firearm, though they’re not much use in this round. As a citizen you want to stay off the dirt as much as possible, use objects and slow movements to throw the Graboid’s vibrational senses off if you have to walk across the dirt. Players can can even toss items to each other. Every match is different in that the tractor will be missing different parts, and so you won’t be looking for the same things in the same places all the time, you also won’t know what you need until you make it to the tractor. The explosives are dynamite sticks so someone will need to find the lighter in order to use them. If everyone is killed then the Graboid wins.\n\nPlaying as the Graboid is quite different. The camera is always above the surface, and you see everything in much the same way Toph did in Avatar:TLAB. Everything looks grey, but when anything makes contact with the dirt, you see a orange ping that ripples out from where contact was made. If the impact with the ground is too hard then you don’t just get a ping, it creates an outline of whatever hit the ground, the outline lasts for a few seconds. Movement requires awareness, the faster you move the more the ground deforms around you thus giving away your position, when you surface and attack someone they appear as orange silhouette, as if looking through infrared.  Explosions are like flashbangs, they turn your whole screen white and make it impossible to see what’s touching the ground for a few seconds. There are certain structures you can destroy/knock over as a Graboid. These are highlighted by being outlined in white, if you can gain enough speed then whatever you’re charging will either break or topple over. \n\nYou can also send your snake tongues out, their about 15ft in length, and the camera changes to a first person perspective where it’s centered in the middle snake and you can slightly see the left and right snake on either side. \n\nThe game is in color when you’re seeing through the tentacles. (I know the movies make it clear the snakes are blind too,  just roll with me for fun’s sake)  you can move in essentially any direction for 15ft, the action button attacks with the middle head, the L and R triggers attack with their corresponding heads. Hold them down you’ll grab whatever you bite, it might be a player, or some kind of obstacle. \n\nIf you eat dynamite as a Graboid, you die. That’s why there’s only three sticks of dynamite on the map and only two of them are in the same place. When someone takes one slightly too quick of a step, the ping looks exactly the same as it does from a tossed stick of dynamite, so you need to be wary as a Graboid, don’t just go lunging at every ping you see. Don’t even immediately investigate as you could wind up blinding yourself and allowing the citizens to make accomplish some vital task. Which brings us to Phase 2.\n\nThere only has to be one survivor left for the citizens to win round 1, there can obviously be more, but as long as there’s one person then round one goes to the citizens. If you don’t kill any and they get the tractor up and running and make it to the mountains then they win the game completely. But if you manage to take down at least one then you’re still in the game. What happens next is the map changes, the citizens no longer need to worry dirt. They’re making their way through a craggy ravine full of separating paths, little caves, and a pond with some buildings around it. They need to make it to the other side of the ravine where there’s a trainyard. \n\nThe Graboid, metamorphoses and becomes Shriekers. Shriekers play much differently in that it’s first person and everything is in thermal vision. You’re above ground now and can do things like running and jumping, you can even climb on top of each other to reach places. The citizens you killed in round one, become your fellow Shriekers. As a Shrieker you are much more vulnerable, especially if the citizens were smart and armed themselves to the teeth in round one. Their guns can kill you now, going in all alone is not a great plan, even when they’re all by themselves, instead what you want to do is find food around the map, animal carcasses, abandoned campsites, any food that might be in buildings. Eat enough and you spawn a little clone that quickly grows to your size, each Shrieker can have two clones that follow you and can be sent out ahead to draw fire away from yourself. Coordinated attacks are really the way to go this round, otherwise you could find you and your fellow shriekers full of holes. Shriekers can zoom in, by raising their heat sensing organ they can get a closer look at citizens and what weapons they might be carrying. \n\nIf all the Shriekers are killed then the Round 2 is the end and the Citizens win. If all the citizens are killed then Shriekers win. But if they make it to the train, and there’s still some Shriekers alive, then we enter Phase 3.\n\nThe the player who was originally the Graboid is chosen to become the Ass-Blaster. Unlike the previous two rounds however as the Ass-Blaster your goal isn’t to kill everyone, it’s actually to call as little attention to yourself as possible, you’re trying to find a place to lay your egg. The Citizens are the ones doing the hunting now. Your volatile innards make getting shot at very dangerous. The trick to this mode is is it’s safest to fly at night, but you’ll only find a place to lay your egg in the daylight. So you’ll want to get a birds eye view at night, then scope out the area closer in the day. I know it’s not cannon but I feel like the Ass-Blaster should have camouflage ability that allows it to blend in with its surroundings as long as it holds still.  If the Ass-Blaster successfully lays an egg then the Graboid player wins. \n\nCitizens will want to find some kind of incendiary Weapon, if you combine cotton, gasoline and a crossbow you get flaming arrows which do substantially more damage to the Ass-Blaster, three shots and it’s down as opposed to unloading a magazine to take 3/4 of its health down. There are also search lights the Citizens can maneuver around, if you are seen by them you’ll need to worry about more than just player Citizens shooting at you. Computer controlled anti-air guns will open fire if you don’t take cover immediately. It’s not all sunshine and roses for the Citizens this round however.\n\nPlaying as the Ass-Blaster has you playing in 3rd person, and heat vision is toggle ability. You are surprisingly quick on the ground, in order to begin flying you must charge up your ass blast and then jump. Whilst in the air you can preform deadly swooping attacks, holding the attack button will cause you grab your target, you can then release them to their death whenever you see fit. While on the ground you are also capable of charging the ass blast and releasing it, while on the ground it’s much more like fiery shotgun, except instead of shells it’s just a bunch of fire and strong concussive force that destroys flimsy things. Even non-flimsy objects can be set on fire if they’re flammable. The Ass-Blaster is far from defenseless, but the goals have somewhat been flipped for the humans and the Graboids.\n\nIn the end I just wanted an asymmetrical multiplayer game that still gives those who didn’t fair so well in the beginning something to do. And I was watching Temors and I just thought huh, that kinda fits nicely into the asymmetrical genre. "

ajiacm,Taking a step back in Spell Creation.,"[What inspired this idea was this photo.](https://i.redd.it/neaoqp0gvdc21.jpg)\n\nIn a lot of games, spell creation or enchantment are really, really boring. It's basically just ""Acquire rare ingredient. Shove rare ingredient into weapon. Done!""\n\nWhat if the game showed these, too? In fact, made it into a game?\n\nI found myself wondering; what would lead to a tattoo design like that? Oh! What if each different shape amplified a magical effect in some way? \n\nSo, for example, you have a system where *crescents* enhance the power of a spell. *Straight lines* effect the range. Complete circles effect how much magic the spell can hold. Maybe the checkered part influences the type of effect it has. \n\nMeanwhile, the amount of ink you have to work with is controlled by the ingredients. So, for example, [look at this image!](https://i.imgur.com/u1rjlG8.png) Fire essence might draw lots of crescents but be very poor at making circles. While Electric Essence might be great at circles, but terrible at lines! BUT, if you try to overload a spell with too much of one, it might change effects entirely, or the entire spell might just collapse under the strain!\n\nAnd *then*, you can have advanced spell effects that do other things by balancing the various amounts in different amounts! For example, a spell that has perfectly balanced Lightning and Cold essence might provide Paralysis. \n\nSo players would start out with a very basic spell. A straight line connecting a circle to a crescent. And from there, the *players* would have to fiddle with the system to create better spells, find better ingredients, read books ingame on spell creation, and ultimately grow in skill at an *actual* crafting system that is closer to art than stat allocation!\n\nNet result; what once was a boring tedious slog could become an actual fun part of the game."
aj987m,Genie-Aka a card game I'll never be able to make.,"So I came up with a version of this idea a while back and have tweaked it in my head a few times, and decided why not just post it. I'll never make it because I don't know anything about card cames and I can't draw so it'll never leave my head otherwise.\n\nThe game is called Genie and it's a four-player card came where the players take turns between being either being the genie or trying to get their wishes granted from the genie. The problem is these Genie's curse all their wishes. It goes for four rounds so every player has a chance to be the genie once. At the end of each round the current points are tallied and the highest amount at the end of all rounds wins.\n\nThe way to get points is to get the best wishes granted from the genie while your a wisher or if your the genie trying to minimize big scoring wishes from the other players. To this end, there are two decks, the Curse deck that only the current Genie draws from, and the Wish deck which all wishers draw from.\n\nThe game can go with clock or counter-clockwise but always begins with the first Wisher next to the genie either way and goes from there. On their turns the wishers draw six card and can discard any they want and draw back up to 6 once per turn. They then make 3 wishes thus gaining points until all wishers have done so.\n\nOn the genies turn they draw 9 cards but can only discard 3 and pick up back to 9. They have to use theses cards to curse the wishes they are granting thus taking away points from the other players.\n\nThe goal as I said is to get the best score but you can play the wisher a few ways. 1stly You can either go out out with your absolute best wishes and hope to get weak curses thus insuring your score is high. 2ndly You can go for more medium scoring wishes and only curse those who are a threat while leaving others alone. Lastly you can go for the worst scoring wishes while waiting your turn to be the genie.\n\nWhich leads to the ways you can play the genie. 1stly you can just use your worst curses to take anyone in front of you. 2ndly you can be more careful with how much your curse while still spreading them throughout the table. Lastly you can use the curse to better position yourself in the current round.\n\nAnd that's Genie. I know this idea in my head most likely came acoss terribly written out because it's only been in my head before now, and I know I have spelling and gramar errors everywhere, but I hope you can look past them and see what I tried to convey."
aj92i0,The Weatherman,"I imagine it as a 2d platformer, where you play as a character only referred to as the weatherman. Rather than predicting the weather, his forecasts actually cause that weather event to happen. Attacks in the game would be related to common weather events such as water, wind attacks, lightning, hail, etc, and would have different shot spreads, effects based on the damage type. I also thought of a double jump mechanic where he creates a small tornado around his lower half that propels him an extra type. Haven't been able to come up with an enemy or story yet, but I imagine a sort of ""fatality"" cutscene where he says something cheesy like ""I have forecast a 100% chance of severe lightning storms directly overhead,"" and a cloud appears over the boss and executes it, but this can be any severe weather event such as massive hail,  typhoons, or maybe even solar storms later in the game to show his powers evolving.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThoughts?\n\n&amp;#x200B;"

aiqtm7,"Your game ran out of budget, and you, the main character, must play without accumulating debt.","This is not your typical burst of escapism where the selling point is that the player can do anything and everything, destroy and create worlds without a second thought. It’s actually the opposite, a meta, comedic take on the destructive and costly nature of how games are played. The entire game plays out like a normal (imagine 2D Mario) platformer, jumping running and collecting coins, at least that is so until the first fall you take. The character then drops down, holding his knee and moans like a pained Peter Griffin. The game comes to a halt, an ambulance arrives, and takes you away. Then you return to the main scene, now a magnitude poorer by the look of the scoreboard. This is where the game really starts.\n\nThe player is forced to notice the game is just a patchwork, low-budget reality TV production, bursting at the seams. The set pieces fall apart when hit, costing money to fix. The enemies are actors in costume and they play dead. If you kill one of them for real though, well, I’ll let you decide what happens. The game then becomes a puzzle where you think every moment about what action to take and how to take it. The simplest game interactions become a dreadful financial maze to navigate. Need to unlock a chest? Hire a locksmith. Want to make health potions? You know, you should take this online alchemy course.\n\nThere are two ways to take this idea. You can make it a puzzle game where you try to beat a level within a budget. Or, you can make it a Truman Show mystery where the character makes choices that diverge from what is expected by the producers, and unravel a dark secret behind the “game”: They are holding multiple characters hostage and you must band together to find a way out. Or something like that. Have fun brainstorming, and thanks for reading my first idea!"

The time is real life 24 hours and you have a queue system in which you get matched against similarly geared players and spawn at the place at which you last died .

aimunw,"A ""Movie"" that you can spectate as a ghost","I have had this idea for awhile now of a ""movie"" that is executed with a game engine and that didn't have a fixed camera at all. The player would be a ghost that can move through walls and ""stuck"" itself into any person or object whenever wanting to do so. Player could also rewind time back or forward as they like.\n\nLets for example pretend that a batman movie was executed like this. The ""player"" could just stick to batman and watch the whole story from his perspective, or at any point the player could jump into any civilian and see everything from their perspective. Or the player could stick with batmobile if they wanted, which would probably be pretty boring, tbh. \n\nFor this kind of project to be enjoyable from many different perspectives, every single character would have to have a meaningful and exiting story that keeps entwiningwith every other people's stories. So when perceiving the story from a civilians perspective, every now and then that civilian reads or hears something about what batman has done and they would have opinions about it, which would affect their relationships with all the other people they meet. And when batman destroys half a city while fighting joker, some of the civilians would actually die and so on and so on.\n\nAlthough I understand that this kind of ""movie"" would be a massive feat to get to work, I still think it wouldn't be impossible. Maybe scale it down? A Twin Peaks -esque style of story in a small village where you could follow whoever you wanted?\n\nWhat do you guys think of this idea? Or has someone already done something like this?"

aimd98,An idea for a fallout online concept,"Fallout Online (This is just a conceptual idea that I wanted to share)\n\nThis Reddit post has a lot of effort, thought and emphasis on it. Players can host their own custom servers with custom rates, mods and rules etc and there would be official servers. Servers can hold between 0 and 300 players, and map sizes will vary from medium, to very large.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\*Map\*\n\nThe map itself will be procedural generated, with preset monuments. The biome spread out and monument locations will be randomly placed between each server, and each server will be a different layout. Each server will follow a 2 stage wiping schedule to balance the server. The first wipe being the structure wipe, which will remove all structures and items players have built and collected. It will come in the form of a nuclear explosion, and will drastically change the map layout. A mushroom cloud will be visible in the background for one day after wipe, and 2 new monuments will spawn. Players PIP boy blueprints will not be wiped. The second wipe will wipe the map, and players blueprints and will reset the server. It will come in the form of the Enclave FEV virus. 5 days before the final wipe, the map will be patrolled by Enclave soldiers and vertibirds. Every map will spawn with 5 large monuments, those being...\n\n\-The Vault: Will be the area where all players who join the server will spawn at for first time. The vault will have PvP disabled for the first 4 days, after which the vault will be locked down, and players can kill each other. The vault before lockdown will act as a communication area, trading area, safe zone and area to explore. The vaults interior will be the same for every map, and will have: An assembly room, recreation room, armoury, tool room and the tunnels.\n\n\-The army base: Will be a very large compound patrolled by hostile robots and enclave, however the army base contains loads of weapons, armour and blueprints. It is also the only location where signal flares can be found, which can be used to call in BoS airdrops which contain very strong gear, however it will alert all players on the server.\n\n\-The science lab: A large building with underground labs, a hotspot for finding components, blueprints and is the only place where the decoder can be found. The decoder will be explained later in the post. Hostile scientists will patrol the science lab.\n\n\-The broadcast centre: A large radio tower which can be entered by players. It contains a radio room, which acts as a broadcasting centre for sending global voice and text to all players, it is useful as in this game there will only be local VC and local text.\n\n\-Raider camp: A large camp full of raiders, very dangerous to explore but has loads of components, weapons and armour.  Raiders in Fallout Online will randomly patrol monuments and will attack players on sight. Attacking the raider camp stops raiders from spawning.\n\n\-Ruins: A small preset city which has destroyed buildings and areas to explore which has lots of loot. A hotspot for enemy mobs and animals to spawn.\n\n\-Testing grounds: An nuclear testing town which is extremely dangerous to be around. Has loads of small houses to loot, and will not be patrolled by NPC's. Loads of nodes will spawn too. An explosion will randomly occur throughout the server which will change the weather, and will lockdown all monuments, make the map radioactive and dark. All mobs will dissapear.\n\nThe 2 monuments after the structure wipe will be...\n\n\-The crater: A highly radioactive, large crater which will contain loads of nodes, mobs and loot.\n\n\-The BoS settlement: Will act as the safezone similar to that of the Vault, will be permanent on the map.\n\nEach map will have biomes.\n\n\-The greenlands: Areas not affected by the fallout, is green and has blue skies etc...\n\n\-The wasteland: Gloomy and dark biome with some mobs spawning...\n\n\-The tundra: A cold, dark and hilly biome with loads of trees and nodes...\n\n\-The desert: A flat desert with dunes, with loads of nodes and small monuments\n\nSmall monuments include red rocket gas stations, old police stations, buildings, super duper marts, abandoned outposts and more. They all contain ""terminals"" which will be explained later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\*Gameplay and mechanics\*\n\nThe game itself is an online survival game, however unlike many fallout titles, it will not contain RPG elements, no leveling system or stats. All players are equal in health and HP etc, however players can cosmetically edit their characters appearance. They can choose to be a human or a ghoul, however none will have any gameplay changing impacts. Players will need to mine, loot, kill, build, explore and survive in a procedural wasteland, inhabited by other players... friendly or hostile. Players will all spawn with nothing but a map, which will show the entire map layout and where they are on their pip boy. The pip boy will act as an inventory management system, map, blueprint manager and faction manager. The game will be PvP focused, and the gunplay/combat will not be similar to that of previous titles. Weapons are deadly, and it will only take a few hits to kill players, armed or not. If a player dies, they will not respawn with what they had in their inventory.\n\nPlayers will need to craft, find or buy weapons and armour if they want to survive. All weapons, armour and items have a level scale: base, 1, 2, 3 and rare. This means that they can only be crafted at a bench of the corresponding level. All players will be able to craft base items, however they are low grade armour and weapons which are weak against other people. Leveled items can only be made if a player has the PIP boy blueprint for it...\n\nTo get an item blueprint, players will either need to: Find the blueprint for it, research the item, take the item to the decoder, or use a terminal. Item researching consists of taking an item to a research table which the player can craft, and spending bottle caps for the item blueprint. The item will be destroyed if it is researched. A terminal is found at every monument. You can use a terminal to browse through the item tree (weapons, armour) and selecting a level (1, 2, 3). It will cost bottlecaps, and will give a random blueprint of the category and level, for example if I chose to get a level 2 weapon, it would give me a random level 2 weapon blueprint. \n\nTo make items a player needs to make a bench...\n\n\-Workbench: Used to make weapons, tools and traps. Can be upgraded to level 2 and 3. components/materials will need to be placed in the crafting bench to craft items (or you must have the materials/components in your inventory), crafting will be queued, and will be crafted automatically and quickly.\n\n\-Reloading bench: Used to make bullets. Works similar to that of the workbench.\n\n\-Chemistry bench: Used to make chems, meds, some components and energy weapon ammo. Works similar to that of the workbench.\n\n\-Armour bench: Used to make armour. Can be upgraded to level 2 and 3. Works similar to that of the workbench.\n\n\-Radio bench: Used to communicate, send text/voice messages and trade to players far away.\n\n\-Recycler bench: Used to break down components and items into materials.\n\n\-Refinery: Used to refine uranium, and smelt ores\n\nAll benches, traps can only work if they are powered by a generator. A generator is powered by refined uranium. Uranium can be mined around the map, picked up from the floor and recycled from items. \n\nResources that players will need include...\n\n\-Wood: Collected from chopping down trees, picked from the floor, recycled.\n\n\-Stone: Mined from stone nodes, recycled, picked from the floor.\n\n\-Metal: Mined from metal nodes, recycled, picked from the floor.\n\n\-Sulfur: Mined from sulfur nodes, recycled, picked from the floor.\n\n\-Iron: Small ammount gathered from metal nodes, most will be gathered from recycling items and components.\n\n\-Uranium: Mined from uranium nodes, picked from the floor, found around the map, recycled.\n\n\-Electronics: Found around the maps commonly, collected from robot mobs, recycled, made from the chem bench.\n\n\-Clay: Mined from clay nodes and stone nodes, can be found around the map commonly, can be picked from the floor.\n\n\-Polymer: Made from clay and iron at a chem bench. Used to make high tier weapons/armour/items.\n\n\-Fiber: Picked from the floor, used to make rope and sewing kits and is used as a material.\n\nGrinding in Fallout Online will not be tedious, nodes will be everywhere, and players will receive high quantities from them. They can also be found around the map in barrels and crates or at monuments. To make weapons and armour, players will need components which cannot be crafted, but only found, such as: Springs, weapon bodies and gold. \n\nBuilding in Fallout online will be very similar to that of rust and ark. Players will need to upgrade their base to stronger materials, have traps and defend their loot. Players can raid each others bases with explosives, or by doorcamping etc.\n\nPlayers can make their own factions, and it will be listed to other people in their pip boys. Players can join other peopels factions if they are allowed and team with other players. The game can be played solo (unlike ARK and other titles which is extremely difficult).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope you enjoyed the idea, a full weapon/armour list can be found below...\n\n \n\nFallout online \n\n\*Base weapons\*\n\nBow\n\nCrossbow\n\nPipe revolver\n\nPipe shotgun\n\nPipe rifle\n\nNailgun\n\n\*Level 1 weapons\*\n\n9mm pistol\n\nLaser pistol\n\nRevolver\n\nRepeater \n\nDouble barreled shotgun\n\n\*Level 2 weapons\*\n\n10mm pistol\n\nPlasma pistol\n\nMagnum \n\nHunting rifle \n\nLaser rifle \n\nM1 Garand \n\nService rifle\n\nThompson\n\nGrease gun\n\n10mm SMG\n\nPump shotgun\n\nLaser triblaster\n\n\*Level 3 weapons\*\n\n12.7mm pistol\n\nDesert eagle \n\n12.7mm SMG\n\nLaser RCW\n\nM4 carbine\n\nAK47\n\nG3\n\nCombat shotgun\n\nHigh power rifle (Sniper rifle)\n\nPlasma rifle\n\nPlasma scattergun\n\nLMG\n\nLaser MG\n\nBrush gun\n\n\*Rare weapons\*\n\nGatling laser\n\nMinigun\n\nHeavy machine gun\n\nTesla cannon\n\nPlasma MG\n\nWave gun\n\nAlien blaster\n\n\*Base armour\* \n\nLeather armour \n\nBone armour\n\nScrap armour\n\n\*Level 1 armour\*\n\nRaider armour\n\nBucket helmet\n\nBiker helmet\n\n\*Level 2 armour\*\n\nMetal armour\n\nCombat helmet\n\nSoldier helmet\n\n\*Level 3 armour\*\n\nCombat armour\n\nSalvaged power armour\n\nRiot helmet\n\nSalvaged power helmet\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;"
ail5c9,Finishing the NES version of Retro City Rampage?,"The man who studied NES code for Rom City Rampage was a very smart man just to give it up and make ""Retro City Rampage"" instead. The NES version was impressive and I think I'd like to see him finish that version just for the hack of it. \n\nThe first simple thing to put in that game is maybe a vehicle selection variety. Not too much vehicles, just a police car and a firetruck, maybe a corvette and a pick-up truck and you got everything covered for ground. Maybe a skateboard with a design you can look at. \n\nSoda machines- Coke - $1.99 \n\nMug O' Beer- $2.99 \n\nGun - $9.99 (this is a gag) You can find ammo in the sandpit of a playground?\n\nThe radio will have a default song and then one other song you can switch to.\n\nTitlescreen will have music\n\nAmmo is health, maybe? One more thing I would like to see are atleast a couple missions. I don't even care if you just have to rob a bank or complete 3 circles around a moving car. The NES Rom City Rampage was impressive and more could have been done for sure! "
aii4mq,2d Sidescroller where you attempt to pay respects and have to put down the remains of those upon whose graves you've trespassed,"Side\vertically scrolling game, takes place in average ""forest with signs of last civilisation, savage tribes, and occasional advanced alien thing."" You find murals that depict an ancient band of heroes throughout, with the first inspiring protagonist to seek their resting places. Major bummer though, as you progress to any of them the sparsely distributed murals along the way show how they were separated, then went to their deaths, with the final mural(s) after you fight what remains of them depict them meeting their fate, or the last things leading up to it. Our heroes are: The Berserker: big guy with an axe, driven mad by isolation, wandered into a massive hollow log pile (arena time) and part of it collapsed on him, breaking his neck\n\nThe Beast: big crocodile\dinosaur lookin' thing, fell down a chasm and landed in a tar swamp, where it drowned and decayed\n\nThe Hero: small human thing, got lost in ruins and quests on, aided by their protagonisty power to make friends with almost anyone, finds his way to the deepest vault after a bloody encounter in which all their friends were wiped out, goes mad and befriends the spiders... and take that any direction you want\n\nAny alterations or additions (more boss ideas would be wonderful for this) are very appreciated, this isn't coming from a pro\n\n"
aihywh,Bob Ross Platform Puzzle Game,"I was thinking of a pixel game (celeste style) that had Bob Ross as the main protagonist, the mechanics would be quite simple, a jump, a dash and a container with oil from where he shoots pressing some button.

aiesyt,Looking for simple mobile game idea,"So I'm currently in a state of mind where I don't have any good game idea, so I'll just post this here and see. What I'm searching for is a simple mobile game idea, where the player controls the game just with one tap, or gestures, but nothing complicated like buttons or that. I want it to stay simple. The game can be 3D, although it will be targeted to mobile so maybe 3D is too power consuming (but if you have a 3D game idea you can still post it :) ). And also the art style should be low-poly or minimalistic, but that doesn't has to do with the game idea."
aid54a,"An otherwise traditional roguelike but with a real-time ""time only moves when you move"" twist.","Other than this twist, the game would be a traditional roguelike. Top-down dungeon crawling with sword and magic and all that jazz.\n\nTime moves when you move—just like in traditional roguelikes—and the *only* change to tradition is that movement and action is not tied to a grid or any ""step"" system. Time would work a lot like how SUPERHOT's time works, in fact. If you move or perform an action, time advances for everything for the time it takes to complete your actions.\n\nThis allows the player to control the pace of the game just like with a traditional roguelike, but also lets the game be untethered to a grid or step system.\n\n****\n\nThe idea came from an argument over whether games like Crypt of the NecroDancer are roguelikes or not, according to traditionalists that think a roguelike *needs* to let players control the pace. And the idea was to adhere as much to a ""roguelike"" as possible but still having the freedom of movement you expect in a modern game.\n\nEither way, I think this could be a really good mechanic for a roguelike. It's sort of how you complete control of the pace in FTL, or even SUPERHOT of course."
ai5wyd,A FPS with swinging mechanics,"A simple game with maps, high obstacles that you can spawn/stand/walk on, the floor of the map far under the obstacles would kill you. You would have a dedicated button to use your grappling hook to swing off the obstacles in each map, some sort of rechargeable boost to keep you going. You would have some sort of laser weapon that takes time to charge up, but if it hits, it instakills. The game would be hitscan, and gamemodes could be similar to games like CoD, with Team Deathmatch, Domination, etc. I could see this being polished down the road, but I could see a game like this working out really well for people that like fast-paced shooters."
ahzpl3,Cloud Based Evolution Simulator," \n\nThe idea would be to create a virtual ecosystem housing evolving creatures with physics controlled bodies and neural network brains. \n\nIt would be more of a nerdy curiosity rather than a game and perhaps give some scientific insight in to evolution and behaviour though ""players"" could certainly spectate and maybe some servers would allow interactivity, playing God etc.\n\nEvolution simulators are far from new but they have always been extremely limited in scope. Some simulators have simulated [relatively complex behaviour but only 1-2 creatures at a time](https://archive.org/details/sims_evolved_virtual_creatures_1994). Whereas others have simulated [large ecosystems but with very simplistic creatures](https://store.steampowered.com/app/396890/Gridworld/). With cloud computing you could have the best of both worlds.\n\nEach computer connected to the server would be responsible for a certain amount of creature AI and of course there would be backups and redundancies so you don't need to be always online. Simulation speed would also be able to slow down or speed up depending on how many computers are connected and the ecosystem size could grow or shrink gradually (maybe by changing sea level) to account for longer term averages in server activity.\n\nAs far as the simulation works everything would be energy and physics based. Plants would gather energy from the Sun to grow, animals would eat them and use this energy to grow, heal, reproduce, move, sense and think. Animals could eat other animals to gain energy though I would have this governed by evolved behaviour rather than giving animals a carnivore/omnivour property. Movement would be bone, muscle and joint based and use Newtonian physics, strength would be based on leverages and muscle cross-section.\n\nIt would take too long to explain every system but fundamentally movement, combat, digestion, respiration etc would all be physics/logic based and consume energy so there would be a cost to animals getting stronger/smarter. I'd expect the body plans to be a bit more complex than spore plus they would also include various organs. This may sound complex but it could be simplified quite far, for example the size of the digestive tract would modify how much energy the animal uses at rest, maximum meal size in one sitting and speed at which food is processed which could all be handled by a few dozen lines of code tops.\n\nThe terrain itself would be modifiable by the creatures a little more so than Minecraft, they could make shelters, dig burrows, dams and possibly simple tool use.\n\nThe senses would be based on 5 we are familiar with plus maybe a couple more such as gravity. Senses would use energy and also be limited by the size of the organ and parameters. The eye for example could have a lens which can see a wide angle with low angular resolution or narrow angle with a higher angular resolution, bigger eyes could gather more light but would use more energy and a creature could see a wider spectrum at the expense of resolution.\n\nGenetically each creature would be male or female, ""DNA"" would be split in to separate chunks which over time could potentially merge, split, duplicate etc and mating success would be determined by a lock and key section of DNA which would simulate speciation.\n\nI suspect we'd start to see familiar behaviours evolve, cooperation, competition, pack hunting, herding and the beginnings of morality (animals being less inclined to kill/eat from their own group/species etc)"

ahvpsl,Stardew Valley meets Overlord,"I’m far from having the technical skills to make a game like this, but imagine a game where you can run an evil empire day by day, season by season, year by year, just going through the everyday life of an evil Overlord. It’s not just a hack n slash, it’s not just a life simulator, it’s a bizarre hybrid of both. You could explore the world, produce new minions for your adventuring days, gather resources (or assign minions to do it for you), find true love in the strangest of places, and take control of an entire continent.\n\nIt would be so cool to have a game that’s kind of like evil Factorio but with less proc gen and more NPCs to talk to.

I would want the generation of each animal to be as free as possible to get crazy animal designs.\n\nIdeas to go into the game:\n- Have your own research facility to take in these animals to research\n- Research includes studying anatomy, psychology, ecology, etc. of the animal you found.\n- You can give the species a name.\n- Each species has some randomly generated subspecies to go with it.\n- Each species has a common ancestor to show you how the animal was “made”.\n- You participate in the study, feeding, and teaching sessions.\n- You can teach the animals tricks.\n- Animals will have a random IQ factor, which can give you access to teach smart animals weird skills that normal animals can’t learn.\n- To share the animals you find, you have a zoo in which people online can view to see your animals.\n- You can decorate the zoo to your liking.\n- Zoos show all the info you’ve gathered about an animal. \n- Some animals have weird quirks like rolling up into a ball or having acid skin, etc.\n- You discover animals by going on a safari to strange but interesting places.\n- Maybe breeding can be a thing. People can try and get different versions of an animal.\n- Maybe a domestication process and having pets too? Idk\n- Animals have different foot prints,feeding processes, hunting processes, voices and sounds, etc.\n\n\nI don’t expect this to be real, but I think it’d be a lot of fun.

ahtg6f,Traditional fighting game with smash-like elements for its infinite combo prevention system,"This would be a traditional fighting game along the lines of Street Fighter, so KOs are about dropping the health bar to zero as you might expect. The health bar works a lot like Marvel vs Capcom (with real health and red health that regenerates slowly over time), but all matches are 1v1.\n\nA lot of fighters have infinite prevention systems that work in various ways, but this one would make it harder and harder to keep combos up by increasing knockback the longer you combo. The knockback multiplier would mostly only affect the current combo, but some would linger around so that you actually have to mix things up and use different combos as the round goes on. Much like Smash, combos need to be improvised to some extent.\n\nIn addition, rather than characters bouncing off the edges of the stage, there would be ring-outs. Much like Olympic-style wrestling, these do not end the round, but instead returns both fighters to neutral position, knockback multipliers reset, and red health fully regenerates for both players. A point is also awarded for ringing out your opponent, but it only has any value if the round times out. You can only ring out by being attacked; for your own personal movement, the edge of the stage is a wall."

ahle1r,A trap-based stealth game,"It's basically a stealth game but where you have no direct attack, you can only place traps.

alfpuf,Space Robbers,"Isometric game where you and a crew 4-6 rob banks/space stations/cargo ships in space. Your goal is to commit robberies without getting caught/killed. \n\n\- You can play either online 2-4 or offline 1-6 (single man robbery where you take on all roles but will be much harder)\n\n\- Before starting the robbery you have up to 5 minutes to make a quick plan as to how you will execute the robbery. (Online, the leader will set way points and communicate via mic or text where each players goes/does)\n\n\- Once the robbery starts you have 2 phases. Pre assault (scoping out/waiting for the time to strike) and assault phase (initiating the robbery, fighting/negotiating with police and escape).\n\n\- During the pre assault you approach the target and play it cool as if everything is normal. This phase allows you get into position so that you can assault at the right moment. (prevent the alarms from being hit, minimizing witnesses).\n\n\- During the assault phase the robbery begins. This is the point that the masks come on and the guns come out. You need to do crowd control, breaking into vaults/cargo etc, escape.\n\n\- If everything is done correctly it should be possible for a robbery to take place without having to deal with police. Even if the police arrive on scene then there is still a possibility to escape via negotiation. This would allow for more complex game play rather than just shooting everything in sight. \n\n\- Players can take on different roles, (gunman, safe cracker, getaway driver, etc)\n\n\- Adding in sci-fi elements to committing robberies would allow for interesting/funny scenarios to go through.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do you guys think?

alfmbm,A castlevania game but more open world,"Been a long time fan of Castlevania and now that Netflix made a show about it, which I LOVED, I’d really enjoy a castlevania game that’s much more rpg than previous versions. Like in Breath of the Wild, you could just go fight the final boss whenever you want, even though it’s extremely ill advised to go ill equipped. Dark souls level of hard, but better fighting mechanics. "
alfcgc,Scannerz,So way back when there was this handheld device that would scan barcodes and you would either get a monster an item or you would battle. Someone needs to make this game for mobile. 
alfa4e,Game where you’re a wizard. But the only thing you can do is bring statues to life. As you level up you can bring bigger and more powerful statues to life. Starting with garden gnomes. Turn based combat. Enemy wizards can also bring statues to life.,I was in a city looking at an enormous statue and went “hey what if you could recruit statues to fight for you”. It’s very Pokémon esce right now so if anyone has any ideas to separate it that’d be super cool.

al5h35,A game where you are a smuggler working in the middle east,"A fictional arab country, with three fictional rival factions, one is a terrorists group, the other is the local government which has ties with the east, the third is a western-backed rebels group, it'll be similar to shinibido way of the ninja on the Ps2, where the three lords send you mission contracts and you choose which lord you want to assist and empower, in my game, you smuggle wrapons and equipment, bypassing checkpoints, the stuff you bring in are whats keeping the factions in fighting condition but you can do other missions, you May provide armed escort where one of the factions want to strike a deal about new weapons or gear uogrades with sources from outside and want to send a negotiator but also want to keep a low profile so they ask you to send a small armed escort group, other missions include ambushing enemy convoys, attacking outposts, or ration stockpiles, counter-ambush missions where you smuggle false documents about one of the faction's movement routes to a rival faction, luring them into a trap then attacking them, and once a faction is weak, you can then kidnap or assassinate its high ranking commanders until the faction general himself is exposed so you can finish him off, eliminating his faction from the game"
al4pgv,Need help coming up with game mechanics,"About two weeks ago, I saw a post on this sub that had an interesting idea. I'm thinking of using this idea for one of my school projects so I would like some help in coming up with ideas as to what the game should be like. [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/aft2pj/a_fps_where_you_use_grenades_instead_of_guns/) is the post I'm using for my school project idea.\n\nThe idea is for this type of game to be in first person mode, but I feel like that may be too difficult to do in a single semester so I have decided to make some small changes. I feel like the game would be more manageable if it's done in 2D rather than 3D, so I was thinking of making the game be similar to smash bros. As for how the game will be played, I was thinking that the levels should have a main stage with multiple platforms floating around that the player can use to dodge attacks from their opponent. I was also thinking that the levels should be destructible since the players will only be able to use bombs. \n\nAfter these basic ideas, I don't really know what else the game should have. Online multiplayer could be a possibility, and maybe other modes were you could do 2 vs 2. I'm hoping you guys could give me some ideas as to what I could add to the game to make it more interesting "
akyq80,"VR versus keyboard, Attack on Titan style fighting game","Having only one friend in the group able to use the VR headset at a time, while everyone else watches on, gets a bit boring. This gave me an idea for a game that lets everyone in on the fun.\n\nYou are in an arena with two to eight players. The VR player is a savage giant. The giant itself has mighty strength but its cumbersome body is also a struggle, perfectly represented by the VR’s limited POV and movement.\n\nThe others, connected to the game on keyboard and mouse / console / (phones?), must overcome their limited size, using their agility and specialized skills to subdue the giant.\n\nYou can have many playstyles for your human players: Talisman uses spells to bind the beast’s rage, basically shoots paper charms that reduce its power. Ninja parkours across buildings, leaps and latches onto the beast. Engineer sets traps to trip it, Pilot drops bombs. You can also have Sniper, Archer, Grenadier, the whole nine yards. They work together, assisting one another by transporting each other, baiting and luring the giant into traps, etc.\n\nGame modes I can think of: Deathmatch, each person one life, meaning they have to think strategically and work as a team. Giant Survival, the humans revive and the giant kills and destroys as much as possible.\n\nScaling up the game you can even have multiple giants in a massive server. I think this can spawn a lot of humorous situations."
akt6jm,I want to create a Middle Eastern/European mixed antagonist for my fighting brawling game,"But I am having trouble coming up with some good inspiration for his design. I want him to have that loo like he is tall, maybe more lean, very clean cut look. But I can't decide if I should make him lean or bulky. Or long hair short hair, facial features or not. even hair and skin tone. Anyone have any good ideas I can use for inspiration for a good design I can go by for him to give him that intimidating and demeanor look?\n\nHe's supposed to be like a powerful corporate leader and has some demon/devil blood inheritance. Thank you guys."
aksy9p,A more advanced dodge mechanic in Survival Horror games,"Survival Horror can be a great genre at times but one thing I find is always an issue is that you fairly quickly learn how to deal with threats and the scare factor immediately dies.\n\n\nI've noticed this right away with the Resident Evil 2 remake, Mr. X is super terrifying but...he's kinda easy to get away from, his telegraphed attacks are easy to walk around and he stops being as much of a danger when you know how to dodge since he attacks the same ways.\n\n\n\nSo how about a mechanic where when you have an enemy worth dodging, instead of just a roll or step to the side that more often than not gives you a free pass, wouldn't it be interesting to have a two button combo to dictate how you dodge? For instance on PlayStation if Mr. X is coming at you and swiping from his left, you could hold R1 to prepare to dodge(or block if you're ballsy) and then press Circle to dodge under his left arm, getting past him uninjured.\n\nBut if you pressed Square to dodge to your left, he'd be able to swing around and grab you and if you pressed X to dodge backwards you might be within his reach. Triangle being a roll or slide forward.\n\n\n\nIt's a very simple idea but I think it'd be a satisfying way to keep enemies a threat in the kind of game I'm talking about, it gives them a chance to actually get you sometimes so they're not helpless to the almighty roll dodge. For me at least survival games lose all their appeal as soon as you can effortlessly pull everything off.\n\nI think it's way too hard to balance games like this, either it becomes to easy or it's incredibly unfair and just annoys the player. An added level of complexity to dodging would mix things up a bit, it would add some difficulty without bein ridiculously punishing."
aksujw,A Rogue-Lite with realistic fitness/conditioning mechanics.,"[Free Idea]\n\nSo I was playing a mobile app called random adventure roguelike... which I wouldn't say is much of a game, but it's... something... anyways...\n\nI've also been thinking a lot about starting a regular exercise routine, and how horribly out of shape I am, and somehow I merged the two into a game idea...\n\n**Idea**\n\nSoo, what if there was a dungeon crawling game where your health was based on maintaining a healthy daily routine, and doing an optimal workout, and getting a well-balanced diet?\n\nIt could incorporate the latest sports fitness and nutrition science, at least as well as one can in a random dungeon full of deadly monsters.\n\nI can't claim to know a whole lot about the science involved... I just know that you need proper hydration, calories, fats, minerals, carbs, protein, etc... and you need to get your heart rate up for a certain amount of time each day, and do x amount of reps of various exercises, and remember to stretch and warm up and get the right amount of rest, etc... or you will weaken and feel sick and strain muscles and hurt yourself in various ways...\n\n**Metrics**\n\nI was thinking that there should be a bunch of muscle groups on a body chart, with stats for each. The stats of muscle groups that are used in a skill determine how good you are at the skill. It should also show how well exercised and how fatigued and how damaged they are.\n\nAlso, there should be a few bars that show the different levels of different types of nutrition you need, digestion processes, and hygiene.\n\n**Body Care**\n\nThink of muscles as little digital pets that all live in a zoo called your body. You need to feed them, exercise them, teach them skills, and keep them healthy. If you treat them right, they'll grow and get better at working together.\n\n\nAlso, one thing that I think would be amusing is to randomly come upon a monster in the dungeon that has been injured, or has a sprain, or hasn't been sleeping well, and maybe doesn't want to fight anyone today, or can't. And it would be enabled by this game's mechanics. Something I think is missing in these types of games is a gray area between combat and socializing. In other words, don't make every creature want to kill you, make them able to change their mind, make some creatures that can't hurt you. Add some uneasy strategic cooperation.\n\n**Skills**\n\nYou will still have the basic skill bars, but instead of them deciding everything, they can be thought of as precision. You'll have three layers of combat ability. One is the fighting style exp, which is your actual combat experience with using a move that is listed under the style. The second is precision exp from practice, which you can gain even if you aren't in combat. The third is the conditioning of the various muscle groups involved in the skill, which includes mental abilities. For mental skills, precision can be seen as the same as memorization.\n\n**Species**\n\nI like the idea that different creatures bodies have different limits and advantages and disadvantages. Some might have small bone structure, which would limit the maximum size of their muscles. Some might have lower intelligence, which would limit their maximum precision levels. They might have affinities for specific skills, or be able to over-develop certain muscle groups, etc. Some might be very dumb, but have very quick reflexes. I'm also very much into the idea that the mortal species' abilities should decay over time from disuse, and possibly be altered by age. Undead creatures would have their own rules, like mummies can't get stronger or weaker or heal naturally or probably even learn at all.\n\n**Dungeon**\n\nThe dungeon is a strange place, full of weird plants. Probably mostly small plants like moss and grass and weird little herbs and mushrooms. Also lots of weird bugs! Probably also some vines. Lots of glowing things.\n\nIt seems intuitive to me that the creatures would start out normal and familiar near the top, and gradually transition to weirder things as you go deeper. All sorts of cool things could happen as you go deeper, like parasites that give you extra magic, or slowly take over your body, or augment your senses, or just make you stink horribly.\n\nAs you spend time in an environment, you begin to understand the things around you with more clarity. I think there's a huge amount of untapped immersion that can be added by the discovery process, which can involve much more than just identifying potions and armor. Plus, it's pretty well accepted that you'll die a lot in roguelikes, so it wouldn't be out of bounds to make one bite of a bad mushroom kill you.\n\nAnyways, that's all for now, bye."
akqty2,What if spiderman becomes a persona game.,"Although i said spiderman, it can be it's own thing, spiderman is basically just the reference of what type of superhero i'm talking.\n\nSo basically i had an idea, of a game where the player plays a roll of a boy in his highschool who at night become a mask superhero.\n\nAnd the goal is to balance out, your life as a student in a highschool with things like exam, prom, money, social life while being an undercover superhero.\n\nGameplay idea, using spiderman as a reference, at night you around the city as spiderman, investigating and stop current crimes/disasters going around the town.\n\nAnd by day, you are peter parker, doing your best to blend in with people, hanging out with friends, take a part time job, get ready for exams.\n\nLike persona, both day and night must be significant to each other, maybe like being peter parker and doing a part time job can give you money, that money can be use to upgrade your suit for example Or being more social helps open more part of the map."
akn4cb,"Nintendo decides to change the characters from different series, and they have to get used to the change in order to go back to their own world.","Here is the twist though, every time the characters touch a power up or something of the sorts, it will change to an equivalent of their respective game.

akmrc0,Requesting ideas: asymmetric VR experience!,"Hi! \n\nI'm currently stuck trying to figure out some concepts for a VR project I've been working on for school and could use some help for the narrative.\n\nSo far the core mechanic I've settled on is an asymmetric experience in which the VR user is provided one set of information, and the audience is provided another set of information as they look at the screen. (The VR camera rig carries two cameras, so the display doesn't show the actual POV but an alternate one.)\n\nSome ideas I've come up with:\n- Subject (VR user) is the captain of a ship/vehicle and must avoid simple obstacles by telling crewmates (audience) what to do, who then control the vehicle, QWOP style. Only the Captain can see certain obstacles.\n\n-Subject is stuck in a room and must escape. The walls are filled with hints but only the audience can see them. \n\n-Subject has to navigate a maze, except some walls are fake and can be entered (Harry Potter style), audience doesn't see the walls. (Not too fond of implementing movement though)\n\nI want to have a narrative to it though, even if its just implied through worldbuilding or lore, but I have a bad case of writer's (developer's?) block. \n\nI'd appreciate if you guys could pitch some ideas :)"
akl8no,Fire-Based FPS where you absorb fallen enemies,"***""You are fire. And as fire, you must eat.""***\n\nYour character is made up of black and red fire, pretty much [like this one.](https://www.deviantart.com/ruzaku/art/Auditor-from-Madness-Combat-152947890)  \nYour weapons are also made of fire, and you basically pull them out of your body.\n\nThe goal is to kill other players in PvP matches, and once they die, you ""eat"" (pretty much absorb) their dead flames.\n\nEating dead flames has benefits:\n\n* More health\n* More damage\n* More bullets in each clip\n* Your gun is upgraded\n\nBut there are downsides as well:\n\n* Larger size (making you an easier target, yet it does eventually cap)\n* Less speed\n* If you are at the top of the leaderboard, you are highlighted with a marker visible through walls\n\n***MINOR DETAILS***\n\nYou have to drain your health to restock ammo on your weapons. This is because they are made of your fire.\n\nYou can, however, release absorbed flames to heal yourself. (Of course downgrading your gun)\n\n***CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATION***\n\nYou can customize your flames with equipment to grant them extra perks and movement options, like in Splatoon. Examples are faster absorption, wall running, health regen over time, ally boosts, etc.\n\nAnd of course, you have different gun options. Nothing out of this world, though. Simple shotguns, snipers, assault rifles, rocket launchers, etc. Think TF2.\n\n***GAME MODES***\n\n**Team Absorption**: Help your team absorb enough dead flames to win.\n\n**Absorption**: Absorb enough dead flames to win.\n\n**Beatdown**: Players are spawned into a match where one person starts off at a high level. If you are not this player, hunt down the high level player and kill them with your teammates to win. If you are the high level, simply gain enough kills to win. You release flames, but you regenerate health over time.\n\n**Burning Hunger**: Absorb flames to reach the top of the leaderboard, like Agar.io , where it only ends when you leave.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThoughts? This is my first Reddit post. Hope you like."
akkcej,Two very different ideas: co-op wave shooter or 1v1 stealth,"    1. Wave shooter/tower defense\n\n* Players are set in some themed environment (city, island, hell, etc.) where they must defend some type of objective in the middle from invading zombies/aliens/monsters. Every nth wave a boss spawns that requires more damage to kill. Items can be purchased after every round. Players are able to purchase different weapons, attachments, grenades, barricades, traps, turrets, and miscellaneous items. RPG elements are integrated that allow for different stat upgrades such as more movement speed, higher health pool, reload time, etc.\n\n* This game would be best with co-op.\n* This game could work in first-person, third-person, or top-down. It could also work in VR since there isn't a whole lot of movement.\n\n    2. Multiplayer infiltration\n\n* Two players spawn just outside a heavily guarded mansion/base and must gain access before searching for an objective (diamond/confidential files/etc).\n\n* Alternatively, instead of having one main objective, there could be a variety of things placed throughout the building that the player must collect. Whichever player has the most valuable objects after the match ends wins.\n\n* Players can attempt to sabotage the other player. One example would be by making noise in the general direction of the other player by throwing items at their location thus causing the guards to move in that direction.\n\n* First-person would probably be best for immersion while third-person would probably help with the stealth aspect of the game.\n\n--------------\n\nDo any of these ideas seem worth it to pursue?"
akjq6v,Racing game idea,"The game starts out in the 1960’s, it’s in black and white and your character starts off in a 1960 car from that time. \nAs you progress, so does the time period. You unlock newer cars, the game goes from the black and white to that color “vintage feel.” You also unlock more music from that time and start to unlock car mods that would’ve been available at the time. For example, engine swaps bring available later in the game to bring the older cars back to life. \n\nWhen you beat the game, you can then find any cars you didn’t unlock through “barn finds” (or where you would usually find them earlier in the game) and they’ll be really rusty. \n\nMultiplayer should be interesting. Depending on what era that player left off, would be the color of the car (for example, new players would have a distinctive “black and white” color to them, later players having that distinctive vintage look on them. Players who have beaten the game look more modern. ) There should also be an auction of what cars you can buy, and you can see the mileage, how many years it’s been driven (story wise), and the rarity of the cars. There should also be events for cars of certain time periods. \n\nThis game should also heavily rely on taking care of your cars and when you got them. When buying old cars from a store, depending on the rarity, the longer you wait, the more/less expansive it’ll be. \n(For example, buying a 1988 Honda Civic will be less expensive in the 2000’s but a 1988 Mustang will be a more expansive.) \nIf you beat the game, cars that you haven’t touched in the beginning would have trouble starting and would need some fixing to do, this adding more immersion. Also with time, it could be updated to add more newer cars for people who’ve beaten the game.\n\n\nPlease build off of this. \n"

After a time limit, whoever has the most team left wins (1 monster counts for 2 hunters)\n\nTeam summary:\n\nHunters are small and squishy but can revive each other within a certain time set. Hunters also have a fast recharging dash.\n\nMonsters are large and tanky but can't revive each other. They have larger dashes that recharge slower.\n\nMap: \n\nNot huge but there are a few shaded areas (thick jungle or caves) that monsters can hide in.\n\nThere are also some animals that stay in small areas, can be killed easily by either team, these let monsters heal and level up. Animal corpses would despawn after like 15 sec or so.\n\nWeapons (left click):\n\nBefore a match monsters can choose 3 weapon types.\n\nBlunt: short range, slow attacks and high damage \n\nSlash: medium range, fast attacks and low damage \n\nThrowing: long range, medium attack speed and damage\n\nHunters can choose between a few guns, the usual stuff like snipers, automatic rifles, and shotguns \n\nAbilities: \n\nRight click for hunters is reload, for monsters it's scent which allows them to detect hunters in a certain radius\n\nSpace is dash\n\nMonsters start with 1 ability (1 key) and each time they level up they choose a new one (max 3 abilities). Monster abilities range from spitting fire to tossing boulders, to healing.\n\nHunters pick 2 abilities before a match (like a aoe heal, rockets, and tracking darts) the third ability is a dome with a shared cooldown that traps the monster and hunters inside.\n\nI really miss evolve and only an indie game could do something like it justice.\n\nYeah this won't happen but that's why I tagged it dream.\n\n\n"
akipwn,Valhalla: The Game,"Okay, think about this. The mythology behind Valhalla is that the honored dead every day start their morning by going to battle. they fight all day until nightfall when they all return to the great mead hall of Odin. They then feast all night and rinse and repeat everyday for eternity. So the concept of the game could be that the central hub of the game is the mead hall. This is where the player upgrades their equipment and prepares for the morning. It's also where the player can socialize with other players on the server. Oh, did I not mention that the game is multiplayer? Well anyways, there could be different game modes such as team deathmatch, Free-for-all, and king of the hill or something. The games could hold up to 64-ish players, to make the games seem like its a viking battlefield. Maybe the maps could be varied per gamemode but still seem like you're in a plain of existence meant for the honored dead. IDK how the rewards system would work after each match, but I would want everything that could be earned be earned completely in-game. In other words, NO MICRO-TRANSACTIONS. Overall this could be a cool hack-and-slash multiplayer game with simple gamemodes but plenty of customization on the characters and maps. Thoughts?"

ake4sg,Platformer in which killing or avoiding an enemy has consequences,"If you kill an enemy, strong or weak, you acquire his form and powers for a while, but if an enemy kills another enemy (you can evade an enemy or trick it by offering him as bait to other enemies), the enemy that killed the other enemy adds its life and powers to its own."

akda3p,Endless runner where you collect drugs for trippy expirience (Mobile),"I was on random word generator and just brainstorming some ideas I could do, but I'm interested in what others think about it and is it still worth making yet another endless runner (Subway Surfers, Temple Run etc.)\n\n\nSo let's define some basics about the game:\n\nMechanics:\nIt's obviously a runner with mobile controls, but what could make it stand out a bit? \n\nGame objective:\nCollect weed, mushrooms, LSD, DMT, whatever. Different drugs have different speed increase and rate of spawning\n\nCore idea:\nYou start in a monochromatic world and with more drugs collecting, the world becomes faster and colorful (not too much, but so it's pleasant to look at)\n\n\nNow for some questions:\n\na) Who are you running from? Police? A dragon? Something else?\n\nb) What would be game over? When you fail to collect enough so you return to the black and white boring world? Or what if you would slow down without drugs so you're easier to catch? \n\nc) What are the obstacles? Like you have trains in Subway Surfers, what would it be in here?\n\nd) What is the place? Street? Maybe space when you collect a lot?\n\ne) 3D or top-down view? Something else?\n\nf) Drugs are for your speed, but what would you collect for purchasing some powerups or some clothes for character customization? Just regular coins?\n\ng) Is it worth it? Isn't the market already too saturated with endless runners?\n\nh) Is it moral? A lot of kids play games like this, wouldn't it be a bit controversial game? Also epileptic at some points in the game\n\n\nThat's it, I hope it's not too long or too unoriginal, is there already a game similar to this one?\n\nLet me know what you think.\n\n\n\n\n"

This disease would cause the dogs to pass out for a short amount of time, and then re-awaken as a mongrel zombie. These dogs would be extremely agile and predatorial, obviously since they are dogs anyway.\n\nSimilar to the Walking Dead, I would think that people would have to run from their homes and create groups to survive. And of course, just so the dogs don't die off too quickly, they can breed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhelp, there's my idea. Not sure if it's good or not, but it's a start.

The love interest will vary, usually because of breakups or rejection. This will make the character’s happiness level deplete, meaning he walks slower, is angrier, and becomes harder for others to talk to him/her, making the lifetime goals harder to achieve."

You can drop your job, your family and your name and move town for a lump sum, and restart with no one knowing you. The only thing that’s consistent is, at the end of every level, you will get testimonies from people about what a great, pleasant person you are to talk to."
akaijx,"Bomber Crew, but you drop paratroopers, not bombs."," I’ve liked the concept of Bomber Crew, so I’d like to see it in a paratrooper fashion. The crew would consist of the pilot, navigator, jump master, and 16 paratroopers. Your mission is to deploy a certain amount of paratroopers (50% or 60% depending on the mission) behind enemy lines and come back safe. \n\n Pilot and navigator would have similar mechanics to Bomber Crew. The jump master has the ability to change the lights from red to green. When it is red, paratroopers would stand up, making them more vulnerable to flak and other gunfire. Green is when they would jump.  You would have  to time it correctly so that paratroopers would arrive at the correct drop zone. Paratroopers could also be controlled. They could be used as an engineer or medic. \n\n There will be areas to avoid such as heavy flak zones and areas with enemy air superiority. \n\n Before every mission, each paratrooper would have a short description so you could get a little attached to them."
ak9s30,A massive ww2 mmo FPS with an alive world," Games like battlefield or cod or arma are just damn boring with the dead world. I’d like to see a game where each country would have an industry, cities, military, and government controller by players or NPCs. Players can sign up for military service where they can fight in battles when the government declares war. Once you die, it’s over. You’d have to make a new character. You can be Infantry, tank, airman, navy, industry worker, president, car seller, miner, taxi driver, etc. If you commit war crimes in battle by shooting civilians, you’d be arrested and put on trial. Wars could take real life years. There would be gore too"
ak9639,A game based on the Mortal Engines series.,"Start as a small traction island, anti-traction stronghold, or large airship.\nYou have to scavenge for parts that spawn throughout the map, or you can destroy other players. \nStrongholds get a small, medium speed airship to start that they can modify as they collect resources, while traction islands can move on their own but airships and docks are mid game mechanics.\nPerhaps the building system could be like Rust but with custom shapes and optional building grid. Some sort of physics system so you have to balance your island/stronghold/airship.\nFaction/group system. Weight classes to determine island type. (Village, town, suburb, city etc.)\nIslands, strongholds, and airships each have their pros and cons, eg. Airship is weak to fire based weapons, strongholds can be picked off by multiple islands working together, islands can be immobilised by engine or wheel damage.\nStrongholds can carry heavy weaponry and are very resilient, islands are mobile but can't hold as much weaponry, airships are highly mobile, but have the least weaponry and defence."

It was 4v4 heroes and you would buy mobs to send to the other team to try to take out their base and vice versa. The more expensive mobs got stronger and gave you more gold per second with every purchase.\n\nYou and your team is basically defending your base against their mobs and trying to take them out with your own. Leveling up getting skills, buying items, and sending stronger and stronger mobs until one side is overwhelmed. Can someone make this exact game but on mobile? I have been wanting to play this game for years and I was hoping eventually someone would turn it into it's own stand alone game. "

ak4p8s,"Island Wars, An Survival Semi-Battle Royale","Ok, this game would be a online, multiplayer, 3D, survival, PvP and PvE game set on a world dotted with islands of varying size (1/4-10 miles), type (food, metal or gems) and biome (jungle, desert or artic) . The goal of the game is to claim and keep a hold on as many islands as possible. To claim an island, you must make a structure or something similar that can not be quickly placed down as to keep players from going island to island spam-claiming them. Let us call them ""Landmarkers"". \n\nTo 'overthrow' an island you must destroy that person's Landmarker and build your own. Of course, there will be fights over this, hence the name *'Island Wars.* The alternative of fighting is just sharing the island with other players. It can be split with up to 4 players. The drawback to this is that it will not be counted as claiming a full island, but rather a half, third or quarter of an island.\n\nBetween this, you must keep up with your needs also. Stuff like finding and hunting for food/water, finding warmth/coolness, dealing with sicknesses and injuries like broken bones and bleeding. Sleep and hygiene may make it in too, but would be unlikely as it would make the game too tedious.\n\nYou start with just an ax to cut down trees. You must get resources and skill to build up your tech (weapons, tools, vehicles etc.). You can make many weapons, tools, items, vehicles and food items. this stuff includes shotguns, pistols, rifles, longswords, katanas, sabers, bows and crossbows, saws, computers, refrigerators, cars, boats, aircraft, pizza, ice cream, yogurt, canned foods, and even mechs.\n\nI guess it would have 'Seasons' or time limits before a winner is announced as to make winning more feasible and always on ones mind. It would probably last for 6 month to a year in real time. The winner is the one with the most islands of course. You may even get more points for having a base( A place defined by having a bed and several buildings.)\n\nDue to the nature of the game, there is no heavy plot, but rather more of a backstory. A underground group of scientist make a miniature planet for someone to own and rule.  But of course there are **A LOT** of people who are very enticed by this, so to make things fair, they make a game  where any who can fight and is fit can join. The goal of the game? To be the one who claims the most islands after a set time.  "

ajx3pm,A detective game where you clone people’s minds and watch them interact.,"This is more than inspired by Black Mirror’s idea of cookies, a.k.a a copy of a person’s consciousness with all their memories. Now with that technology available, you are a detective who solves crimes by having these copies of people put in a space where they can interact, represented by a blank room. How they interact can tell you many things about the mystery. You cannot ask questions or feed them information in anyway, but you can manipulate the room. Bring in items directly related to the case and see how they react. Starve them for days and find out whether they are actually allergic to peanuts like in their statement. Watch as a happy couple break down and be at each other’s throats. The copies/items you have are limited and you basically are watching clips unfold. Morality is never in question (after all, they’re not real people), but the player will have to stop and think about how far they will go for the truth."
aju943,my 'dark souls idea',"i would make a game pretty much like dark souls, but the bosses would be all based off the planets in our solar system. even the bosses appearance is based off the colors of the planets. they all have a weapon and a tiny little backstory or something. starting with\n\n Mercury, just pretty much a grey alien/demon who attacks you with diamonds. his personality could be completely cold hearted like an alien would probably be. he is scientific in his attack strategy.\n\n next boss is Venus,  who is a buff man floating inside a constantly exploding cloud who attacks by causing earthquakes. his personality is actually very gentle, he hates the damage he is causing and is sad that nobody sees him for who he is and that also angers him. \n\nnext boss- Mars who is an all black monster, hardly and features. mars has three legs and three arms and he fires lava and fire from his limbs. his personality is just war hungry. he's been there forever as a 'burning warrior'.\n\nnext boss is Jupiter, a large brown wolf type beast. he is very dog like and barks extremely loud causing earthquakes. he attacks with his fangs.\n\nnext boss- (based my Reddit profile after this one lol) Saturn. Saturn is a giant human looking monster made of sand and has a head but no features. he is naked and attacks with a blue trident. he spins it so fast it makes what looks like a disk in front of him. you can still see Saturn through the spinning trident. \n\nnext is Uranus, a blue baby girl who floats and attacks with ice beams. Uranus is psychic (i pronounce it as YER-A-NISS not your anus lol)\n\nnext is Neptune, brother of Saturn, he has the exact shape and size as Saturn, and uses a brown trident, he even attacks the same way Saturn does. each planet made their own trident and they traded their weapons to each other.\n\nthe last boss is Earth, an enormous blue woman with continents all over her body. she attacks in phases, each phase she uses the attack of each boss. Earth is the mother of the sun, and she is defending him against you\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ni know this is probably pretty stupid, i just think it seems like a cool idea. "
ajncqd,Started with an idea now i want to make it a thing," **Ascension** Is a single-player story driven RPG driven by Norse mythology. You will play as a demigod from a god of your choosing as a family line and the story begins when the trials of your worth must be proven. You the player are cast down to a war torn and alternate version of Denmark in 500-AD where the gods values in humans have been tested, exploring there you will expect aspects of Nordic mythology to be unleashed. Dwarves, Elves the famous serpent Jörmungandr, draugers and the occasional giant wolf or dragon.

Where people could look at the game and see it as its own thing, and as they play see the inspiration from other games that many enjoy and love without making it feel like a clone or carbon copy.I started going online and looking for ideas or at least something so i can start somewhere at least and I came across a Reddit thread about game ideas and reading where someone had the idea of you the player was a demigod looking to earn your place among Olympus and the gods. Many liked the idea and some suggested maybe instead of Greek mythos how about Norse mythos. After reading it I gave the idea a whirl in my head on how such a thing could be possible and after a few hours of thinking on it i started searching online for any game akin to his dream of a game and to my surprise there where none. Thus began a huge inspiration and motivation to create something amazing.I started talking to other indie developers and friends and as I explained my idea to them they were instantly wanting the same thing I wanted.Nothing short of a small snowball at the top of a hill to a avalanche at the bottom I started looking for developers that could get on board with the idea and who had the skill to help this dream come true for the people wanting a game such as this. \n\nStarting Work with introductions to new areas...\n\n [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJl9JywHYSw&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJl9JywHYSw&amp;feature=youtu.be) \n\nCamera scene blocking\n\n [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JacvmhhO-Xg&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JacvmhhO-Xg&amp;feature=youtu.be) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nScreen shot from level design and concept art\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/xwlKiuS](https://imgur.com/a/xwlKiuS)\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/ZRt6Bmy](https://imgur.com/a/ZRt6Bmy)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you want to see development just subscribe on Youtube my channel is part of those videos and on my profile description.

ajj46p,"You are athe Greek god trying to manipulate humans to further your own goal, while other Gods do the same.","*Disclaimer: I’ve not played many God games, so advise me accordingly.* I am however fascinated by Greek mythology. Their stories about higher beings using transformative and destructive powers against each other for their own selfish, personal, very flawed goals always felt powerful to me. I wanted something that plays like a God game, not an action game because I only know of board games that utilises Greek mythos in that way.\n\nYou are Ares. Your ultimate goal is war and destruction. Your main foe would be Aphrodite (or maybe Eros), who wants to spread love. On the HUD would be indicators for peace, prosperity, happiness, population etc, and that’s the basis for your objective.\n\nEvents are delineated on a scrolling info box, things like “The Southern Tribe’s head scientist announces visit to the Eastern Clan.” Now while he’s there, you can mind control a soldier to sneak into the hut he’s staying in and kill him. Little did you know, Aphrodite knows your plan and seduces the soldier.\n\nThere are a plethora of Greek figures to choose from, each with unique abilities and goals. You can even enlist other gods to further your goal, by enticing them with something they want. Artemis can control animals. Zeus destroys things in large scale, and wants kinky sex. The possibilities are endless."

aniq8y,"RTS with fully customisable factions, buildings, units","So basically my idea is a RTS like Age of Empires but with fully customisable civilizations.\n\nThe player would be able to create his/her own civilization by picking an architectural style for the buildings, choosing the costume style of the civilian units, the armour if the military units, etc.\n\nThe player would select a limited number of ""spells"" or ""skills"" the civilization would be able to cast.\n\nA limited number of weapons would be selected for each civilization, therefore defining the available military units.\n\nColors could be selected in order to control the hair and skin color ranges of the units. All colors would be available, therefore allowing the player to create ""fantasy"" or ""alien"" races. \n\nThe player would also choose a limited number of food crops / sources (amongst vegetables, cereals, livestock, orchards, fish ponds, etc) which would define the farm buildings available in that civilization.\n\nOn top of the default 3D models of the buildings and units, the game would also allow the player to import custom models (as long as they were compatible). In fact, template 3D models would be distributed with the game. The same would be applied to the images that are used as textures for the 3D models. The idea is simplifying the process of modding the game.\n\nEach player would be represented by a ""hero unit"", which would be larger and stronger than other units and would have a more detailed 3D model. This unit would have custom skills, as well as more customisation options in terms of visual appearance. Basically it would be the same system as the custom heroes from The Lord if the Rings: The Battle for Middle Earth.\n\nThe player would lose when his/her ""hero unit"" was killed (just like when the lord dies in Stronghold).\n\nAnd just like in Stronghold, during gameplay, the player would be able to build his/her own custom castles and fortresses, by having tools to build walls of different heights, stairs leading to those walls, towers of different sizes and shapes, gates, etc.\n\nAs for the other buildings, the player would be able to build them on top of each other - therefore creating buildings with multiple floors. However, there would be a limit to the number of buildings piled on top of each other.\n\nAnd that's it. What do your think? Any ideas to expand this concept?"
ang2os,My strange game idea,"I want to make or have made a slightly more complex chess game (at least that's how it works in my head). It would need to generate the game grid from a image file (that I would like to be able to change in and out) based on a set number of pixels and support game pieces that are larger than one tile (i.e. 2x2, 3x3, or 4x4) and I would like the ability to add and remove pieces as game play moves. I would like to have it as a two window display so I could show just the board and pieces on a second screen but still be able to have (and hide) the GUI on my screen. I would like to have in the GUI an interactive turn list so I can jump/ change the order of play as needed. This list could be as simple as just text but would be cool if it could display a scaled version on the piece too. I would want to be able to populate this turn list from a created pool of pieces that I could add in new or delete old as needed. When a piece is added to the turn list I need to be able to place it anywhere on the board but then it just needs to be able to move to any adjacent tile (including touching corners). The only other thing it would need is a way to move the pieces on the board and to hide pieces from sight until revealed. The whole thing only needs to be 2d.\n\nTabletop simulator has been suggested already and I'm looking into it, but I don't think it can do the two window thing. It seems simple from a user's stand point but what little I know of coding tells me this is a monster of a challenge.\n\nFor those who are curious as to the inspiration of the idea: I am learning to make custom DnD maps in Photoshop and don't have a way to print them to scale properly. Then I had the idea of just using a tv display, but the cool gaming tables with tv's inlaid are expensive. So here is my idea and go!!"

Also, AAA developers has already pitched in their best ideas and made games like PUBG, Fortnite, Ring of Elysium, Realm Royale, etc. and many more to come.\n\nHowever, there has not been, if not already under development, a mediaeval battle royale game.\n\nA mediaeval battle royale with most realistic settings.\n\nLocation: There can be places like a castles and mountains, rivers, lakes, forests, deserts, etc. Moreover, we can also put  god monuments(It's a secret tool that'll help us later).\n\nWeapons: There aren't many weapons to put here. So we can have different attachments or different abilities with same weapon. \n\nWeapons like Club, Swords and other related weapons, Bow-Arrow, Crossbows, Boomerangs, Slings, &gt;!EVEN FRICKING CATAPULTS!&lt;. Weapons list should not only be limited to being solid or non-organic. We can also put weapons like Bee hives(That'll do damage over time). \n\nAt this point it seems that only ranged weapons are feasible because there isn't much mobility in mediaeval times. Yes. But melee weapons can be secondary. Primary has to be ranged. \n\nNow, only crossbows and Bow-Arrow isn't much fun. We can have custom tips for arrows or bolts.\n\n* Fire arrows\n\n* Poison arrows\n\n* Enchanted arrows, that'll do magic.\n\nThis can also be applied for slings, boomerangs and even FRICKING CATAPULTS!\n\nThere are god monuments at certain places. Submitting enough (certain items) will impress the gods, and make gods grant us powers. MAGIC. Praising different gods grants different powers. It's up to us what god to praise and where we want to put magic in.\n\nGod powers can be so varied. This is where we can make it interesting. There are certain animals in the wild. We can either kill it for items like armor, food or we can tame it to use it as ride. We can tame different animals with help of different god powers. Once you kill and equip certain animal's hide, you can't tame the same specie to use it as ride. We can make the animal attack enemies or not I haven't decided it yet.\n\nAnimal taming isn't limited to giant ones. We can use birds to scout. Other small animals to act as suicide bombers that bring bee hives to enemies, etc.\n\nI feel there can be many more things to this game, so I'd love it if you guys were to comment some ideas too. Thanks :)"

So essentially most microbes will die off but manage to mutate and adapt pretty easily, but all the cows and sharks and turtles and cheetahs die.\n\nAll the pets die off, too, due to massive food shortages. People opt to eat them rather than eating each other... but...\n\nTime changes everything. After a few million years, humans speciate and stratify into very different creatures, but they all generally look like humans. Reminiscent of the ancient species that went extinct, some bark, some meow, some chirp. Some are super intelligent and take vacations in space, while some are super dumb and are used as pets or slave labor. Stray humans roam the back alleys, fighting over scraps of garbage, etc. Just change most any time you read 'animal' to 'human' and you get the entire future ecosystem.\n\nYeah it's inspired partially by the Time Machine, but also by real climate science claims. I don't know for sure whether anyone has made a similar game, but it seems like a natural response to the world around us today. It could address all sorts of questions about what choices humanity will make over the next few millennia. It could span multiple planets purely populated by humans, where some areas had major genetic experiments, others had human cleansings, and still others had a lot of natural disasters that led to predator-prey relationships between various subspecies of humans...\n\nJust like the apocalyptic stories about robots that were popular before the current age of automation (I believe they delayed us technologically by a few decades) the popularization of post-apocalyptic fiction where humanlike beings are all that's left, and many are still ravenous for steak, just might help the cause of taking better care of the planet..."
amrw2n,An Open World Transformers RPG,"Title. I just recently got back into the franchise and realized how cool it would be to blend elements of the Transformers movie game and War for Cybertron's multiplayer, where you can choose your vehicle form and weaponry, fight for Autobots or Decepticons and do your best to evade notice by humans."
amrjd0,Questgiver - the real hero is the NPC!,"You play the role of a normal NPC in a High Fantasy setting, in a city hub that receives a lot visits from heroes.\n\nYou're a Questgiver, and as such, your responsibilities are huge for all heroes have a problem:\n\nThey will accept any guest given to them!\n\nBut not every hero has the same karma, reputations, affiliations and personalities - and these will influence the world around you, so be careful to give the right quests to the right heroes!\n\n--------\n\nSo the gameplay is basically just ""associate quests to the right heroes""\n\nHeroes would have LVL that influences their chances to succeed the quest based on the quest level you give them, and their different attributes (Karma, Reputation, Clan Affiliation, Personalities, Class, Race, TBD) would influence the outcome of the quests. \n\nThe town/world would have certains needs (wealth, culture, security, etc) and sending certain heroes to certain quests will affect these meters. \n\nI'm thinking either simple:\n\n*Card game - You get a random selection of heroes as cards, the ones you play influence the meters, you must learn to play the right cards to keep the meters [balanced or filled, TBD] - see: [Nirvana - Game of Life](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=goldtusks.doron.nirvana)\n\n*Management/tycoon game - The size of the Inn determines the number of heroes that can visit the town, you get to send them on quests but they take time to be done (higher the hero's LVL, faster the quest done, etc). Town upgrades through the results of quests. See: [This Is The Police](https://store.steampowered.com/app/443810/This_Is_the_Police/)\n\nOr a bit more complex: \n\n*Civilization - A bit like management/tycoon, but the core crux of the game would be less on ""surviving"" (or managing well) and more on building a distinctive ""evolution tree"" based on certain principles. Try and find the right combination of heroes and quests to either make an evil barbaric god-worshiping war-mongers, or an educated technological utopia. So, do more quests associated with Bad Karma and build an evil town, do more quests with heroes associated with a certain clan (The Dragon Hunters) to have a dragon-less world (which would come with its own advantages and consequences).\n\n--------\n\nI have a lot of ideas depending on whichever versions I'm focusing at, but I thought that was a neat concept that wasn't explored enough in my opinion. I'd love to hear your thoughts! "
amqqbl,"""World's Biggest Dungeon"" (only read if you are into browser/idle games)","Recently got obsessed with an idle game called The Perfect Tower and it inspired me to think of an RPG variant to the main concept.\n\nYou have 2 modes, in the dungeon and out of the dungeon.\n\nWhile out of the dungeon, you have loads of options. You can spend resources on new equipment which raises your main stats like Base Damage and Base Defense. Then you will be able to also spend resources on upgrading more technical stats of your character. Crit chance, Crit Factor, Damage multiplier etc etc. In late game, you will be able to unlock spells your character will use, these are upgradeable too.\n\nThe main part of the gameplay, is in the dungeon. There is an easy normal and hard dungeon. The hardest dungeon will take about 2 weeks of 247 idling to get all the way through, of course 2 weeks without dying. The idea is it will take several months of grinding and playing through the dungeon to get stats and spells good enough to make it to the end. The whole idea is that there is a lot to do in this game and potentially hundreds of hours worth of gameplay.\n\nIn the dungeon, the gameplay will go like this. There is actually a GIGANTIC dungeon design (16 bit graphics) and your character walks through it, slowly (one stat you can increase is walk speed). As the player auto walks through the dungeon, they find monsters. Monsters can be fought by clicking attack when its your turn, or simply leaving it idle and set to auto (however this takes longer and earns you less resources). \n\nYou can set it to auto-restart, so every time you die you start back at the beginning. That way you can leave it idle to gain resources. As you raise your stats higher and higher, get better and better equip, and unlock spells you will be able to stay alive further in the dungeon. \n\nAs far as resources/currencies go, there will be several. Some which you gain fast and some which take time to build up. You would use the cheap resources to upgrade stats and hard-to-earn currency on unlocking spells. \n\nPossibly a leveling/experience system as well. Idk, just an idea ive been thinking about, wanted to share it with someone. Hoping some perfect tower or idle game lovers would think this would be a fun game."
amoujt,Level design competition : get your ideas featured in an android game!,"I'm currently planning my next update for my game LEVELS. I thought that I'd ask the community for their ideas! Any levels that are submitted that look good and aren't too similar to current levels will be added to the next update in about 1-2 weeks.\n\nLevels are about 12 arbitrary units wide, about 9 tall.\nTo give a sense of scale, the player is about 1-2 units in radius.\n\nThere are three kind of traps - a circular saw, a laser (straight line between two points) and a rotating laser. These can be scaled and orientated any way you wish.\n\nI've attached some images to showcase a few lentils I've made so far.\n\nLevel ideas for my game LEVELS https://imgur.com/gallery/6vaM9IC"
amo4rr,(Idea) Exploratory RTS/Resource Management,"The game would take place on a planet after a space ship crashes, and builds a factory in its place, from which the player must expand across the planet, in a kind of open world RTS. As the player expands out, they'll find ruins of an ancient civilization, some with intact defenses, and evolved and mutant wildlife that impedes their exploration. It would be a simplistic, overhead 2D interface, similar to a standard RTS.\n\nThe player is tasked with managing the developing system, and while expanding their city must balance the need of many resources, defend supply routes, and make decisions as to how they want to evolve their society.\n\nThe primary resources would be divided into several categories, such as agriculture, housing, manufacturing, and mining, and would be subdivided into increasing specific resources, such as ammunition or batteries, which would require other resources to make, and they need to fit space for this manufacturing, mining, and storage in their city.\n\nWhile the player can't micromanage their units, they can set priorities and assign a certain number to certain tasks, and they will go about it as efficiently as possible. So rather than select a unit and tell them to mine for lead, they would assign one unit to be mining, and the AI will determine the least productive unit to sent to mine instead.\n\nThere are two basic units, Worker and Fighter, which, like the resources, are subdivided into more specialized units. For instance, a normal fighter unit can be specialized in a sniper, tank, scout, etc, with different perks; the player can also research upgrades to the units, increasing armor, damage, speed, etc.\n\nThe game starts with the player as a kind of machine race, but as the game progresses they can research new technologies and develop their society, and can make them more humanlike, or continue and make them more machine like, with different advantages to each.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was thinking about how to develop a more interesting story, and I was thinking about, as the player expands, they'll be given elements of the ruins, and can mine it for resources, or preserve it for archaeology and get background details and some context of the world, along with various prompts giving exposition to the origin of the ship. I think it would be cool to get a different kind of story if you are a more Reaper-like machine race instead of human, just getting kind of cursory information, whereas if they chose to explore it they could get a deeper understanding of the world, perhaps get certain technological or cultural boosts of some kind.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm also unsure about how to handle combat, since the player doesn't directly control units. I was thinking that players could assign units to explore certain areas, and if the units were to discover anything or encounter combat then that would relay to the player, and they could choose to send a larger force, abandon the area, etc. But I am having difficulty conceptualizing it as being a lot of fun to have basically no say in combat other than attack here. Perhaps, you could assign units to a squad, and directly control them from there?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do you guys think?"
amntai,Randomly generated open world game w mechanics like Shining Force 1.,"[Free Idea] (or is it a request?)\n\nI've been playing shining force a bit since they released it free for mobile, and frankly, I feel like I'm trapped in a very claustrophobic little box. I like the game mechanics, but the story makes me want to roam free, see unexpected things, etc.\n\nAlthough it might be nice to be able to raise baby creatures from birth/eggs, which would require a class development system. Also might be nice to gear skill improvement more appropriately to actual use.\n\nOptional unnecessary details: maybe 1.5 player multiplayer support. Ability to build your own cities. Maybe even a semi-random discovery storyline.\n\nBeyond that, I'd say I'd probably play it for thousands of hours.\n\nExtra credit if it's a minecraft adventure mod. Haha, maybe not?\n\nOr is there a game like this already? Preferably for mobile..."
amng43,Does a game even slightly similar to OASIS from ready player one exist in the VR genre?,I am a game Dev  and watching ready player one made me wonder if such games exist or might come to existence in future . Would be really cool to actually be able to do all things like in the movie\n\nI know haptic suits exist and multidirectional treadmills as well but combining them with VR to create such an open world multiplayer game could probably take years\n\nWhat are your thoughts ?
amipuj,High Fantasy adventure game,"The idea is that you start out as a first time adventure in the capital city of a large empire, and you decide to join an adventurer's guild. There would be three playable classes: magic, ranged, and melee, but each has there own sub-classes such as different weapon types and fighting styles for melee, different elements and types of magic, bow vs crossbow for range just to name a few. The guild would have a ranking system. From lowest to highest : porcelain, bronze, iron, steel, obsidian, silver, gold, platinum, mithril, adamantite. You would complete bounty board missions such as deliveries, defending caravans, slaying monsters, exploring ruins, etc. The goal is trying to increase your rank to adamantite adventure while gaining power and the favor of the nobles/king. I don't have a story idea yet but story missions would be available after reaching certain milestones, such as a new rank or a slightly randomized number of bounties completed.\n\nThe setting would be reminiscent of elder scrolls game but it would have a much lighter tone, and it would be mostly open world, except you would load into big cities, whereas small towns or villages would appear on the main map.\n\n&amp;#x200B;"
amg0u0,Different take on CO-OP horror,"So I recently played through the We Were Here and We Were Here Too campaigns and I got really excited for this kind of game style.\n Basically, both players progress through the map while trying to explain what to do and how to help each other.\n My idea goes as follows: Someone or something broke into a museum or factory that you and your friend work as security guards in. You and your friend have to hopefully track down and arrest them. One of the players sits in the office, checking the cameras, locking doors or turning on/off the lights, while the other player explores and gives information to the other player. The main thing is that it's really damn scary and the players are locked in a huge dark building with some horrifying thing that may kill them. One player is panicking, shouting at the other guy, the other guy trying to do something about it, kinda like Keep Talking And Nobody Explodes.\nTL;DR: Two guys locked in a building with a scary creature, helping each other out to escape in an ""Keep talking and nobody explodes"" manner."
ame6cv,(new to this subreddit don't really know what to do) The Legend of Dragon Islands mobile game,"Last night I was thinking about how DragonCity and DragonVale (way back in 2012) are virtually the same game. DragonCity graphics are *somuchbetter* but the soundtrack on DragonVale just can't be beat.\n\nAnyway, I was thinking about my own game that follows this kind of path called (The Legend Of) Dragon Islands. My goal for this game was to make a more immersive feel to DragonCity with new additions, less waiting and more customization.\n\n(Note: I am not a game developer. I have not the slightest idea of how to design a game. I just like to imagine sometimes.)\n\nIt starts in a regular house. No dragons, no anything. You get to choose a name for your character and customize. After a short scene in the house about waking up late for school, you see a bizarre light outside the window. Curious as you are, you decide to check it out, and you find a transparent staircase. Once you grasp the railing, it shows to be gold and ridden with rubies and red string. You walk up the staircase to find Dragon Islands.\n\nThe Dragon Islands have some notable changes. One; there is walking space between all of the buildings/habitats. There are plots to put buildings, and some are bigger and reserved for specific buildings, but most of the ones you can place fit in the regular-sized plots. You can customize the tiles at any point, but they are only dirt at the beginning.\n\nThis is where similarities to Dragon City start coming in. You buy your first dragon and place it in a habitat. I have thought about the different types for a while, and they consist of, in order of when you unlock them (the first 4 are from the beginning), Water, Fire, Plant, Air, Ground, Electric, Snow, Metal, Magic, Hero, Evil, Void. Void is a legendary type, meaning it cannot be bred.\n\nFor dragons, I have decided to have one dragon per each breeding possibility to start, bringing the total up to 144. Here's where the interesting part comes in: Primal Forms. (I'll get to those soon.)\n\nThere is a completely different leveling system in TLoDI. Levels are determined by how many dragons you defeat, and do not add to your strength. The thing that adds to your strength is the Gym, a workout place just off the main islands. You can send dragons to the Gym, and they will gain Strength by themselves, albeit slowly. However, if you physically help them with training, they will gain Strength much faster. You can have up to 10 dragons in the Gym automatically, but only work with one dragon physically at a time. \n\nYou will need Levels to do certain things, but Strength is the factor that really empowers your dragon. Food does not do any of this; Food has two main purposes. Giving Dragons food increases your bond. This is good for many things; it decreases the amount of time for it to do tasks, such as working out and breeding. Also, you can sell food for Power. There are different types of Power for each element. If you have a strong enough Bond with a dragon and 100 Power of its type, you can turn that Dragon into the Primal Form.\n\nPrimals aren't just a carbon copy of the original Dragon; they are a completely different Dragon, possibly with correlations but definitely not just the same dragon with an aura. They have higher stats and have different origins, but keep the Bond, Strength and Level from their counterpart.\n\nIf you breed two Primals, there is a 5% chance that you will get a Primal as the offspring.\n\nBattling is an interesting concept. Since you need Levels to do certain battles and you can't get Levels out of battle, I introduced a concept called Training. In this mode, you can battle dragons at any time; no time constraints whatsoever. These increase your Levels, so they are necessary. Of course, there are other things you can ask me. Please do tell me whatever missing plotholes I have left and I will try my best to explain.\n\nAnother thing, since it seemed like I kind of ditched the story mode feel of it, is there are two modes for navigating. There's God Mode, the mode in which you function DragonCity, or you can walk around on the paths and personally inspect every building you need to interact with. This is just a starting idea, and there would need to be much more in a full-length version of The Legend of Dragon Islands."
amag6p,A game where you have to infect the minds of creatures and then prep them for a date.,"You play as a newly discovered species known as a Pairing-parasite - a matchmaker, if you will. After your discovery, you decide to come out of your microscopic shell and encourage other creatures to do the same. So, you create your own family-run online dating domain called the Para-site. Here, various creatures with anxiety will sign up to get infected by you so you can send them out on a date. Once you infect a creature, you have to fancy them up for their date (buying a tux, using deodorant, eliminating halitosis, etc.). Once you arrive at the date, you will have to choose the proper things for your host to say to charm the date. You run by a 'if you don't get the girl, you don't pay a penny' service, so if you fail to charm the date, your host kicks you out and you have to find a new one - fail enough times and your site will begin receiving bad reviews. If you win, however, you eat part of the host's brain as payment - thus making you grow larger. You start out infecting small insects, like giraffes, and then move on to infect larger objects, like entire planets, etc. At the end of the game, you collapse under your own mass and become a black hole, where you swallow the entire universe and become so large that you become another universe's small and the process starts anew."
am8kvo,Platformer in which enemies you kill are added to the list of characters you can play with,"Metroidvania style, you have 4 slots for characters. The first slot is for your main character, the other 3 for enemies you kill. \n\nYour main character cannot be replaced, but the others are replaced in a fifo style (first-in, first-out) automatically with every enemy you kill. You can tap 1 to 4 at any time to choose with which character to play with."
am84bp,"A racer like Wave Race, except on land with hover bikes AND NOT like Jet Moto.","Racers ride on hover bikes that float relatively high over land. The closer they get to land, the more force they repel back. This allows you to ""dive"" down to launch yourself upward for massive airtime. \n\nIt's almost like jet skiing over invisible water.\n\nAnother way to think of it is as if the hoverbikes had a force field around them that pushes back with exponential force the further in any other mass gets.\n\nSince the hover bikes repel against anything solid, you can also use this to bounce off of walls, steep declines for a boost forward, and any level geometry on the race course. The physics and futuristic theme would allow for wild racecourse designs, such as ones with vertical hairpins and whatnot."
am7ass,Mobile dream game,Sup folks!\nI have a simple question for you: What is your dream game on mobile? What do you wanted to play but never found on app store?\n\nI'm Robin and I'm actually student in the last year at CS. I really like to develop games but now I don't have any idea. \n\nWhat I want to do:\n1. Get a discussion with gamers about their dream game. That means what do you want to play to spend some time. \n2. Get some advices from you as players.\n3. Combine more ideas in one.\n\nSome technical rules for this challange:\n1. 2d tap game\n2. Can be any genre\n3. You can come with an existing game but tell us what do you want to change/improve.\n\nLet's play! 😎
am6jky,No name as of yet.,"An open world MMO of a post-terraformed Venus with magic.\n\nIn a distant future, mankind was able to find a true cure for all diseases after the ""successful"" migration to Venus. This cure was the discovery of an ancient magic that had dissipated from Earth after the fall of the fairies, dragons, and wizards near the start of the Renaissance era. After much strain on generations of humans due to the constant bombardment of magic on every system of the human body mutations occurred which genetically modified homo sapiens into ""8"" new anthropomorphic races. These races vary in form: large mammals, birds, reptile/amphibian, canine, feline, aquatic, elemental, and ""unchanged"" humans where each possesses unique traits and abilities suited to their new selves. Mutations subsided and these new species continue on without any more changes.\n\nThe magic system is a little complicated. It is a bit like a plug and play combination system requiring a lot of trial and error to perfect. Each player builds spells that they have to repeat multiple times to work out which areas they are more suited for. The stronger you get, the more complicated your spells can become.\n\nGet rid of the guns and zombies (unless magically raising the dead or using magic projectiles).\n\nVarious magic forms can be stored in vessels (every day items or weapons and armor) to reduce strain on the caster, and can promote quicker activation of spell work.\n\nThe idea behind this game is to promote a very personalized experience that no other person could be capable of. I imagine a *Ready Player One* system setup with a *Sword Art Online* style of player interaction. In game qualities come from concepts like *HunterXHunter, Magi, Skyrim, WoW, etc...*\n\nI am still very early in the idea stages and willing to accept constructive feedback."
am2uhw,Any suggestions for an original block breaker game theme ?,"Basically anything go's except that it needs to fit in with the basic mechanics. Just the basics with a paddle ball and bricks . The bricks will change to a ""damaged"" state if they need be hit a certain number of times to break but that's about it .\n\nThe bricks don't have to be bricks and the paddle does not have to be a paddle but you get my point .  "
am1fm2,"A game where you, a robot, rebuild yourself as you fight.","Imagine a game where you could loot enemies for new parts, not for armour or weapon, but as a part of yourself.\n\nA battle-worn warrior on the verge of death, you were granted a second chance at life by an eccentric scientist. You agreed, and became a sentient android, your instinct the only human part left. With your prowess and his regenerative technology, you were near invincible; your parts could now repair themselves as long as they had the resources.\n\nMy dream version of the game would be a 2D hack and slash roguelike. You aim with a mouse/analog stick, with two buttons for combat, each can be melee or ranged depending on which “limb” you have. As you strike or shoot enemies (who are robots) they blow up and parts go flying. If you hold a designated button near a part you would “pick it up”. Time slows down (think SuperHOT’s grabbing weapons in mid air) as you decide which slot to fit this new part into. Sword arm, gun arm, shield arm, laser arm, gun leg (?), wheel legs, missile shoulder pad, heat detecting visor. Maybe oddball combinations are allowed, like rocket launcher in the legs letting you fly.\n\nCareful not to lose your limbs. Losing an arm means fewer weapons. Losing legs equals loss of mobility: you can crawl with your hands or shoot, but not both. A headshot means you lose vision, too many shots: death. Keep extra limbs handy by plugging them into your back (I can imagine the main character looking like a porcupine, which could honestly be a cool design). If you end up Black Knight-ing with no limbs, you can roll around and absorb stuff from the ground."
alwyh4,Overthrow a city mafia,"You play in a decently sized city. Maybe Chicago sized including surrounding areas. Unlike most games, no place in the city is inaccessible, you just need the right tools. Now you can go into that bookstore. You can see what is inside the 43rd floor of the tallest building. But that's not the point. You and you alone are tasked with bringing down the mafia within the city. (I am a fan of the Just Cause series so think of that style.) It's very hard to tell who is a member or not, and you must use the clues given to you by witnesses/ex members etcetera. You are allowed to kill the members, but it is best to detain them and take them back to stations around the city for interrogation. This is a rough idea and I am totally open to suggestions. If this is somehow magically a game please let me know."
alwhl9,What lies behind the door (horror),"  \nMy Idea: What lies behind the door(raw title) (First Person/Third)\n\nThis place is taken place in a giant office building.\n\nIt's an scary game. All your doing is opening doors. There hundreds of doors. There could be like 1000 rooms. Each floor with about 10-50 rooms (all numbered).\n\nYour in the biggest building and start on the top floor trying to get to the first floor to escape.\n\nYou and 3 other people can team up to go down to first floor. Each person starts with their own flashlight (cellphone).\n\nAlso each person comes with a skill to get through the game.\n\nSkills: Each person comes with a talent to help get through the floors easier.\n\nFor example: Bill has luck (so if he opens most of the doors the chances of getting good stuff is better if\n\nSam open the door then a monster would jump out\n\nNow there is a a Ghost is this game: it can open and close doors, turn off/on lights, make creepy noises, change numbers on the locked doors when your about to open it, make phone rings, start microwave in break room and other random things.\n\nTo trigger the ghost, the ghost will hide behind one of the doors. You open the door. There nothing there. But the you hear a noise of some screaming from a distance. Congrats the ghost is now out.\n\n\*\*\*the ghost appears in any room/any floor \*\* trigger early and it will haunt you till you escape\*\*\*\n\nMost rooms will be dark. But lots of rooms with have light switches to turn on. There be dark hallways too. But pattern of the hallway and rooms will always repeat. There also side rooms for restrooms, janitor closet. Items in the room are random. Take stairs and there elevator (limits you to only floors you have visited). There a door to the stairs but it will always be locked every on every floor. So you maybe have to check the rooms for the key.\n\nEach room can be a blessing or nightmare.\n\nGeneral Info:\n\nTo eat: you need to check- rooms, break rooms (fridge, cupboard for food)\n\nTo drink: drinking (use the energy drinks, drinking foundation or bathroom faucet).\n\nHealth: Find med-kits (10%) find health in the janitor closet, rooms (pill, wraps, ect).\n\nCross: you need these to keep the ghost away temporary. Look in rooms and grab them to help you.  \n\nNow you start by opening the first door (example): find 1 pistol on the floor with some ammo. Next door: Find some food: 3 apples on the counter. (You will need to eat and drink to say alive.)\n\nNext door: you find a key with number on it (but it's not on the current floor), Next door: first monster creature jumps out and tries to kill you. (you kill it), Next door: nothing, Next door: you see a random zombie sitting in the chair watching tv (static coming from the tv) get close to it and its surprise jumps attacks you or something else random. Last door on the floor: you find the key to exit the stairs. Take the stairs down to the next floor.\n\nRepeat. Enter the hallway &amp; Hear a scream (help), Open first door. Congrats: you found a survivor. (you can play this solo and find survivals in the rooms to team with you. Next door: you find another key. The # on the current floor. Go open: you find a piece of paper with a code number on it. You keep doing this over and over. Possible puzzles added in the rooms too. Clues, messages, warning written in blood on the wall.\n\n\*note the more floor you visit. The faster the elevator will take you to open locked rooms\*\n\n\*if you released the ghost. The ghost will sometimes stop you from reaching the floor you want to reach in the elevator\*\*\n\nSo you do this as you work you way to the bottom floor and then escape. You have police, fire truck, ambulance, new reports, love ones greeting you as you come out. And it's game over.\n\nThat is one ending idea. If you have an idea for different ending I'm okay with it too.\n\nRepeat, Hard Mode, Hardcore, Realism Mode: harder to find ammo, more monsters, zombies, more locked doors (find the key #).\n\nThat is my game idea. I'm not a game developer but I did find this reddit to hopefully give someone a game idea to make. Let me know if it sound interesting."

aluxd2,2 Ideas in one: Last Place on Earth (Open world Survival)/ What lies behind the door (horror),"1st Idea:\n\nSo this is my raw idea: Last place on Earth (first person &amp; third person) (short version)\n\nYou awake up on big island (example: greenland). You find out that there been an alien attack. (Their ship in the sky blocking the moon.) \n\nThe rest of the world is destroyed. You and the remaining people on greenland/island are the last of the human race. Aliens are hunting you and the other humans down.\n\nAs an open survival you need to first start out to harvest, build, craft, tame, gain special powers from aliens to fight back. \n\nThere are lots of building, houses to loot, raid, fortify in.  \n\nThere creatures, aliens, robots, humans, and animals. \n\nYou also need to learn to craft a spaceship to fly to aliens ship (you can bring materials with you). \n\nTheir ship is as a big as the island (maybe can be DLC) \n\nBut you will have to repeat what you learned on earth. (Make a new base, craft, tame, raid new building, ect.) \n\nThen fight their leader to win the game to save the human race. \n\nThat's the short version I can add more if you have questions but yeah not sure of this is possible because it maybe too big, but thought I share it. \n\n\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\n\n2nd Idea: What lies behind the door (First Person/Third)\n\nThis place is taken place in a giant office building.\n\nIt's an scary game. All your doing is opening doors. There hundreds of doors. There could be like 1000 rooms. Each floor with about 10-50 rooms (all numbered). \n\nYour in the biggest building and start on the Top floor trying to get to the first floor to escape. \n\nYou and 3 other people can team up to go down to first floor. Each person starts with their own flashlight (cellphone). \n\nAlso each person comes with a skill to get through the game. \n\nSkills: Each person comes with a talent to help get through the floors easier. \n\nFor example: Bill has luck  (so if he opens most of the doors the chances of getting good stuff is better if \n\nSam open the door then a monster would jump out\n\nNow there is a a Ghost is this game: it can open and close doors, turn off/on lights, make creepy noises, change numbers on the locked doors when your about to open it, make phone rings, start microwave in break room and other random things. \n\nTo trigger the ghost, the ghost will hide behind one of the doors. You open the door. There nothing there. But the you hear a noise of some screaming from a distance. Congrats the ghost is now out. \n\n\*\*\*the ghost appears in any room/any floor \*\* trigger early and it will haunt you till you escape\*\*\*\n\n Most rooms will be dark. But lots of rooms with have light switches to turn on. There be dark hallways too. But pattern of the hallway and rooms will always repeat. There also side rooms for restrooms, janitor closet. Items in the room are random. Take stairs and there elevator (limits you to only floors you have visited). There a door to the stairs but it will always be locked every on every floor. So you maybe have to check the rooms for the key. \n\nEach room can be a blessing or nightmare.\n\nOpen first door (example): find 1 pistol on the floor with some ammo. Next door: Find some food: 3 apples on the counter. (You will need to eat and drink to say alive.) \n\nTo eat: you need to check- rooms, break rooms (fridge, cupboard for food)  \n\nTo drink: drinking (use the energy drinks, drinking foundation or bathroom faucet). \n\nHealth: Find med-kits (10%) find health in the janitor closet, rooms (pill, wraps, ect).\n\nNext door: you find a key with number on it (but it's not on the current floor), Next door: first monster creature jumps out and tried to kill you. (you kill it), Next door: nothing,  Next door: you see a random zombie sitting in the chair watching tv (static coming from the tv) get close to it and its surprise jumps attacks you or something else. Last door on the floor: you find the key to exit the stairs. Take the stairs down to the next floor. \n\nRepeat. Enter the hallway &amp; Hear a scream (help), Open first door. Congrats: you found a survivor. (you can play this solo and find survivals in the rooms to team with you. Next door: you find another key. The # on the current floor. Go open: you find a piece of paper with a code number on it. You keep doing this over and over. Possible puzzles added in the rooms too. Clues, messages, warning written in blood on the wall. \n\n\*note the more floor you visit. The faster the elevator will take you to open locked rooms\*\n\n\*if you released the ghost. The ghost will sometime stop you from reaching the floor you want to reach on the elevator\*\* \n\nSo you do this as you work you way to the bottom floor and then escape.  You have police, fire truck, ambulance, new reports greet you as you come out. And it's game over. \n\nRepeat, Hard Mode, Hardcore, Realism Mode: harder to find ammo, more monster zombies, more locked doors (find the key #).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThose are my two game ideas. I'm not a game developer but I did find this reddit to hopefully give someone a game idea to make. Let me know if it sound interesting."

alrkdr,A crossover between SCP:Containment Breach and Crypt of the Necrodancer (Breach of the Necrodancer),"It's basically reskined Necrodancer. BUT! \n\n1.

alqcgt,Game that takes place only in the cockpit of a spacecraft,"Was writing some ideas for a game that takes place in a single location and was wondering how I can take the inside of a spacecraft and make a game out of that with the player only having access to the functions of the spacecraft (switches, electronics, etc) and as a note I really like the atmosphere of games like Subnautica and Alien so if I can fit some elements of those games in there that would be nice. This is just a thought and i'm struggling with how I can create some core game play around that idea, I know creative flexibility is limited for an environment like this especially when forcing a player in a small capsule with little visibility of the outside world."

aloik3,You're a congressperson.,"Think of this:\n\nYou've just begun your term after a hard fought election, and you find yourself on the floor with the other freshmen.\n\nFirst day, you have no idea what the mechanics are, so your party whip shows you the ropes. Catching up on the news, meeting lobbyists and other politicians, delegating your staff and, of course, the voting and debate processes.\n\nThe load is easy at first, but there's a difficulty curve -- you'll find you'll have a lot to juggle over the weeks, months and years. There's a lot of numbers you'll need to keep track of: the attitudes of your party and your constituency, the funding situation of your state and the organizations backing you...\n\nAll this in the hopes to get re-elected in your next term. But even if you do get re-elected, depending on how your party is doing you might find a wholly different president and congressional balance which might make your life more painful.\n\nYou've got a few hours around the city after you go home for the night and during the weekend, but depending on who you are -- for instance, if you're playing a person with a big family -- you might find yourself swamped in other obligations which can impact your time in the office. You can make valuable connections and open up some new routes, sure -- but there's the specter of scandal there as well.\n\n\-\n\nTLDR; political micromanagement game where the end goal is not to become leader but to solidify your place in house/senate and the success of your party. I'm thinking some scripted/some random events with character customization, but the ability to unlock different character history, traits and current political situations which will affect the story and enhance replayability."
alofze,MMO open-world game where each player is a god of their own world.,"It's a low-poly game.\n\nThe aesthetics of the planet you possess is customizable as long as the player has enough power.\n\nYou float through space with your planet and a unique power you can choose. You have to leave your planet, land on an opponent's to fight them, try to defeat other gods and consume planetary mass to grow your power.\n\nYou can farm mana on your own planet by creating villages that eventually level up into something bigger(kingdom, city, etc.) and making followers believe in you.\n\nKeep in mind that if you enter the planet of another god to initiate battle, he will have full elemental manipulation of his planet, meaning he can use his powers(just as long as he has enough mana) to move the earth, winds, waters, and plantation and more, making him more powerful than you, but doing so may cost either a huge chunk of mana or loss in defense or health.\n\nOnce you win, the opponent's planet goes into ""shut down"", it will discolor and be prepared for consumption as your planet swallows its mass to increase yours. You gain his mana in the process, but not his powers. Although, the game could have a thing where you get a token to use a lesser form of one of the opponent's power after slaying him, which you'll have the ability to level up overtime or just get rid of.\n\nNew abilities/power ups can be gained either by finding ruins that lead to boss battles that hold power tokens, or by defeating other players.\n\nI have no experience in programming or gamemaking, but if you are one and want to make this game, I'll be happy to tag along the development!

apl1od,"A multiplayer ghost hunting game, where players either play as paranormal investigators or entities","An online game where there are 2 teams, paranormal investigators and entities, each game lasts around an hour or two, and is set in a large forest with randomly placed areas such as cornfields, a farm and abandoned buildings etc. Each game can hold around 40 players, and around 30 of them are investigators whereas the rest are entities, The game is first person, and the paranormal investigators spawn at a camp with an RV and some tents. Their aim is to eliminate the entities by capturing footage of them through recording cameras, or by killing them or performing specific rituals. Investigators can place portable cameras around the map, and then view them from the RV. If a player catches footage of an entity from the RV, they will need to return to the camera, bring it back and upload the footage which will alert the entities. Another method is to just shoot them or place traps, however it is much harder and slower. The final method is to perform rituals, through finding items around the maps, and performing rituals in specific areas which is very dangerous but will kill the entity. There are different types of entities and investigators. Each game lasts 5 in-game days, with weather and day cycles. At night, the entities get stronger and the investigators get weaker. \n\nPlayers are randomly selected to be an entity or an investigators. \n\n•Investigators have a camera, portable camera, flashlight, radio and a ghost detector. Some of them also have motion detectors.\n\n•Psychic can detect entities easily, has a pistol and a trap and the rest of the items an investigator has \n•Pilot has a remote drone which can be flown to record footage, and the rest of standard items \n•Pastor has a cross which can deter entities, and has the rest of standard items \n•Hunter has a shotgun and revolver, 2 traps and standard items \n\nInvestigators can also call for reinforcements through finding old radio stations, which will cause them to redrawn as special classes, such as \n\n•Sherrif: Has a pistol and psychic sense, and a cross\n•Priest: Has a holy book and holy water which can severely damage entities, and holy book can kill an entity by reading it and if read near an entity for a while\n\n•Camera crew: Has 4 portable cameras, 2 drones, HV camera which when used can see entities from far away through heat vision\n\n•Broadcaster: Has camera crew kit and has a flash camera which takes images and produces a blinding flash which stuns entities\n\nThe investigators can also call for a helicopter at the rv, in which a player controls the camera from a helicopter in the sky, they can see entities and mark them for investigators for a temporary amount of time. The helicopter flies away after 6 minutes or so.\n\nThere are different types of entities with strengths and weaknesses. Entities need to kill, deceive and stop investigators. \n\n•The mole is a random investigator, who is tasked with teaming with the entities. They need to deceive and sabotage the investigators, and help the entities win, by destroying footage, murdering investigators, luring investigators and other methods. They do not have powers, and can communicate with both entities and investigators.\n\n•The grey alien is a small little alien who spawns at a random crash site. They eliminate players by tranquilising investigators, and bringing them to the ship or a secluded area to kill them. They can use a teleporting device to escape or strategically move to other areas, and they posess some unique powers and weapons. They have a blaster, which only has 4 bullets and acts as a ray gun, it kills investigators but makes a very loud noise and can expose the aliens position. They have a temporary cloking device, which allows them to go invisible and off of ghost detectors, cameras and more. A probing device, which can be used on players at the ship to turn them into moles, and a blocker, which temporarily disables cameras allowing them to not be recorded, however it runs out quickly. They generally have the aim of staying away, and picking people off. They can fly the ship away to other locations.\n\n•The fiend is a creature resembling of a man, but has the face of a bat. It spawns at the farm, and it's aim is to terrorise and kill players. They have wings, which allows them to fly. They can pick players up and fly them away, and kill them. They are slow on foot and easy to spot, but very fast and mobile in the air. It also has some weapons such as 3 throwing axes, a spear and a claws. It's aim is to pick players off. When it swoops and picks a player off, it is extremely difficult to be recorded so it can boom and zoom groups... however if it is damaged it will emit a very loud scream, and it's position can be seen by everyone. It can regain heath by eating players.\n\n•The demon is a half goat, half man with horns. It's main aim is to kill and sabotage. They can possess players by morphing into them, they can then take total control of essentially playing as a mole. The original player will be transported to a hellish chamber, and they can only be saved by a cross, or by having the mole be killed which will lead to the player morphing back into the demon. The demon can also kill players only from behind by biting them, however it will emit a loud scream. The demon can play as props to hide themselves, such as trees, animals or items, which they can also use to posess people if they get close enough to. They can also communicate to radios to lure players. Finally, they can also manifest dead players into zombies, in which the original player will now play as a zombie. \n\n•The rake is a tall, lanky humanoid with long arms. It is very easy to spot, however it can sprint very fast. It can pick players up, and run away with them to shred them to pieces. It can also hide in trees or underneath objects, and can lunge and drag players to the areas to kill them. It can lunge at drones too, and can set traps for investigators. It spawns in the cave, and can regain health by eating bones there. It's aim is to kill players.\n\n•The ghost is the support of the entities team. Their aim is to assist the entities, tell them where people are and change the environment and game. They are invisible, and can teleport around the map. It can also open the in-game map to see where everything is etc, they have strong sense and can see players from afar. However, they can be detected by ghost detectors and HV cameras. They can morph into a proxy entity, which cannot do what the entity can do, but can be used to play as decoys etc. They can also morph into ghost form, in which they can be seen as a green figure, in ghost mode they are slow but can attack players. Attacked players will be teleported to a dimension, similar to the hell chamber, they can escape the pocket dimension or can die by getting lost, by following paths etc. They can also mark players, and they can they be seen by all entities. However this can only be done in ghost form, and can be done from far away, a player who is marked can lose it by washing themselves in water, which can be done at all monuments in the map. \n\n•The big foot is what it is described to be. It can destroy cameras, see traps easier, and has very good sense. They can also communicate to other players through radios to fool them or whatever. It is very powerful, and can maul players and groups of players, however it can be recorded easily and shot at easily. It can also mark players from a distance similar to that of the ghost, and it can also set traps. It spawns in the woods. The big foot will cause players it kills to scream. Bigfoot can also charge, which depletes its health but is a very powerful sprint attack. It's aim is to kill players.\n\n•The man, is a tall man with no face similar to slender man. It can teleport, and shift (move very fast invisibly) however, it can only move when out of sight from players. It can kill people from behind silently, and it will leave no trace of the dead player. Players can not record it if they look at it, however it can only be recorded by a player who is out of sight from the man's sight. The player who records the man will be marked to all entities. If the man is attacked in sight, it can charge the player and kill them. At night, the man can move much more easily, and see players on the map. It can also attack people alone regardless if they are looking at them or not. Portable cameras can not record the man. The man is weak against weapons, however when it is damaged enough it can shift away. It cannot regain health. \n\nThose are the entities so far. When an entity is recorded, and the footage is uploaded at the rv, it can be seen by all players and has much lower health. The Hunted becomes the Hunted, however this can be reversed by to the footage being destroyed by a mole. The camp is the investigators base, and they are generally safe there. However, at night the entities can cut power, and attack players near the camp. The games last long, and entities who are killed cannot respawn as entities again, they will respawn as a random investigator. Hope you enjoyed the idea.\n\n\n\n"
aph35x,A game engine with customisable AI's,"This is an idea I had a long time ago when the debate was raging between fans of FIFA and PES over which was better. The idea was to either use the environment from one of those games, or create a new one so it's effectively 'neutral ground', then have two teams playing, one using the FIFA AI and the other using PES AI. Both teams have the same stats to play with, and they can both have someone making subs and certain tactical decisions, but the actual gameplay has to be done by their AI. In fact it could be opened up to a lot of different game companies and have it as a competition. Of course this isn't only for football, the same principle would be interesting with a multiplayer shooting type game. Esports have a lot of interest, having a competition like Fortnite AI vs PUBG AI vs Apex Legends AI etc would be really interesting, and throw DeepMind in there too. "
apdjsu,An open world survival game about laying cable between cities to connect them for transit and trade.,"In this fictional world, anything can travel through cables, including you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt the start you don't know much about your objective. You just know you need to survive and you have a limited number of these cables to help you. You're dropped in a randomly generated world with difficult to traverse landscape and creatures of varying danger. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou can unfurl a cable behind you as you traverse, and at any point you can instantly transport yourself or your goods between the two ends. You might soon realize you can use this to gather one material in one resource spot and use/refine/craft that material in another far away spot. You can even \*send\* things through the cable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou can move cable you had already laid down, connect them together end-to-end, or even slowly roll one back up to collect it. Cables are hard to come by but some can be found just laying around while exploring. Before you collect one you randomly found, it's often a good idea to travel through it to see where it leads.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\### That's how you find your first village.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe people there give you a new crafting recipe for a machine that will periodically extract resources if you put it on a resource point (so you don't have to manually extract it yourself). You put two and to together and connect one of those machines directly to one of your cables so that it brings resources straight to you. Brilliant! The village says that they desperately need X resource, so you venture to make one of these connections to this village. Once you do, the village turns into a town. Now this town starts producing some useful new commodity to trade.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne of the people in that town is obviously not from there. He says he came from a different village somewhere in the North. That's when you might realize that the game's true objective is to connect all the isolated communities to turn them into productive, interconnected cities.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\*\*\*\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDue to the theme of traveling through cables, the setting would best fit a digital/virtual/computer world."
apcsax,Looking for an idea for an educational VR game that has to do in some way with NASA or other space companies,"So I need to develop a VR game as part of an educational outreach program but I’m running short on ideas. I’m only one person and have a max of about 3 months to pull this off (on top of school) so it can’t be something too complex. However, it doesn’t really have to be. Just looking for something engaging and educational, think for like a 30 minute demonstration to high school students. It does have to be in VR (using an Oculus Go) because that’s part of the technology we’re trying to promote as part of the program. I was thinking something along the lines of teaching students about the engineering design process or the scientific method but I’m not sure what to do about that. I’m using Unity and I’m decently competent in it and in making 3D art. I appreciate any ideas, doesn’t have to be perfect. Thanks.\n"

ap9wsi,Intelligent slime battling to take over the earth,"A scientist messed up bad and allowed a bunch of intelligent slimes loose into the world.  Each slime block wants to rule the world so they all fight each other to become the best. Basically, this would be different from other battle royale games because:\n\n1. There would be people with chemicals that would shrink your slime. If you are able to eat those people (by transforming into a puddle under them) then you are able to spew the chemical back out at other players later.\n2. Instead of having multiple guns, vehicles, etc. everything would be made from yourself. So building walls would take slime from your block. Same with building floors, ceilings, etc. Traps could be slime puddles that trap other players or slow them down.\n3. You can grow your slime by eating other players or finding small slime pieces throughout the map. Ingestible chemicals would also be placed throughout the map\n4. In order to kill a player, you need to eat them.  In order to eat a player, you need to be bigger than them.  So if you come in contact with a player bigger than you your only chance is spray chemical at them to shrink them until you can eat them. Adding on to this, I was thinking about the chemical making the slime splatter towards the sprayer, so the smaller player (or the player spraying the chemical) has a chance to grow. \n\nI realize this game Idea may not be possible at all. If it sucks don't just say ""that's stupid"" tell me why too, please. This is just my idea for the game, however, I don't feel like learning code. If anyone does make this game please keep me updated. I'd even pay full price for the game when it comes out, I just wanna know about it."
ap9wpk,Mad Max Battle Royale,"I know people are getting tired of the influx of Battle Royale games, but let's face it - our problem isn't with the concept of Battle Royale (because it's a great concept for a competitive game), it's with the fact that they're all too similar.  \n\n\nWhen I try to think of a way to change up the formula in some way that would still have broad appeal, one game comes to mind as a PERFECT marriage in terms of existing mechanics and lore, if that's important to anyone:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAvalanche's 2015 Mad Max game.  \n\n\nIt already has most of the mechanics needed for a Battle Royale game, you'd just need to make some tweaks.  \n\n\n**The Combat-** Vehicular by nature, the combat wouldn't be changed much from the standard game. Seriously, don't fuck with it - this is what will make the game unique. You've got the momentum-based car damage system in which the heaviest vehicle or the vehicle with the most momentum deals the most damage in a crash, so there's a tactic - collect heavy armor upgrades and tank your way to victory. Or, hot-rod your car out with light armor and a fast motor, and focus on your weapon-based attacks, such as the Thunderpoons (projectile explosives) or the Harpoon (strips away armor and eventually parts like tires and doors, etc).   \n\n\nHowever, being a Battle Royale game, you will want short skirmishes, otherwise matches will take forever - so vehicle health will be relatively low. Ripping the door off of a competitor's car merely requires a well-placed shot with the Harpoon, and then the driver is exposed to be ripped out of the car via harpoon, or perhaps you can board their vehicle and hijack it. If you're traveling in a group, you can team up on someone like this - one car harpoons the door off, another driver jumps out to melee the driver and take their car. It would feel very much like what I imagine the Mad Max world would be like - a vicious vehicular mugging, or something not unlike wolves attacking a deer and ripping it apart.  \n\n\nYou'd need to keep the on-foot stuff as well. On-foot combat will be clunky and survivalist - you need to get back to your car to be effective - but it'll be there. Same controls, same weight, same lag as the single player - again, you want players to focus on car combat, but the option still needs to be present. If you wreck your car, your game isn't over - you can still fend off attackers and maybe commandeer one of their vehicles.  Buildings will house special loot that rewards on-foot exploration, but again, it's a big risk to leave your vehicle for long. Risk and reward, big factors in this type of game.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n""Downing"" an enemy comes in the form of crippling their car (it can be repaired). When they're on foot, consider this effectively the same as crawling around bleeding out in other BR games - except that they're not on a timer, they can stay on foot as long as they can avoid being killed by another player or as the play area reduces (both of which are inevitable if you're not in a vehicle).   \n\n\n**The In-Between-** Your car needs fuel and so does your body.   \n\n\nJerry Cans are always dropped from destroyed vehicles. You get MORE fuel from crippled by not destroyed vehicles, and even MORE fuel from non-crippled vehicles (which encourages some thought to your actions - need fuel desperately enough to take the time to try to pluck the driver out of their car instead of just destroying the car?). Jerry Cans can also be found in Muthaloot crates and some buildings.   \n\n\nKilled players drop Canteens with water. There are water sources throughout the world too, which you can only access on foot. Hear a vehicle in the distance while you're filling up your Canteen? Now you have a choice - hope you've hidden your car well enough that it won't be spotted, or take whatever amount of water you've collected and get back to your car to flee.   \n\n\n**The Upgrades-** The Muthaloot crate system in Mad Max translates perfectly to Battle Royale. See a special crate? Harpoon it and drag it to a safe place to open it. You might even run into situations where players are fighting over a crate, each trying to harpoon it and drag it away - what's more Mad Max than fighting over supplies? But instead of rewarding scrap metal like in the Single Player, it would reward upgrades to your vehicle. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHeavy armor makes you stronger but slows you down and consumes more fuel. Light armor leaves you vulnerable but you're faster and more maneuverable. Ramming bumpers reduce damage from collisions but slow you down. Spiky armor prevents players from jumping onto your vehicle but again, add weight. It's a trade off - be nimble and focus on your ranged attacks (Harpoon, Thunderpoons etc), or be slower and less maneuverable but have the ability to shove lighter cars around like they're nothing? A boosted slam attack by a heavy car vs a lighter car will cause SIGNIFICANT ramming damage.  \n\n\n**Reducing the Play Area-** Again, a feature already exists in the game that can be easily modified for this purpose - the sand storms. In Single Player, the sandstorms are dangerous because you can be hit with debris or struck with lightning and damaged. So take the sandstorms and basically create a persisting sand storm that encircles the playable area. Everything outside the ""blue circle"" is deadly - lightning strikes, debris, near-zero visibility. You CAN survive it, but not for long. Everything between the ""blue circle"" and the ""white circle"" is a relatively light dust storm - windy, dusty, lowered viability but nothing really dangerous. And of course everything within the white circle is the playable area where there is no storm.  \n\n\n**The Drop-In-** This is the part that I'm having trouble with. It doesn't make sense to parachute in. You could maybe do something with the hot air balloons, but that would maybe seem silly and then you'd still have to get players to their vehicles. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou could do something trippy like have each player start as an ethereal crow flying around and as you fly down to the ground, your character drives into frame in the car and then when you get close you assume control of the character/car...  \n\n\nOr maybe just skip the drop-in altogether and let players pick their spawns, and the game will just put you in the general area. The map is big enough that you can space out spawns enough.  \n\n\n**The Lore-** I mean, could it be more perfect? Isn't every Battle Royale game just a Mad Max type world where everyone is savage and fighting to survive? Now you've got a PERFECT fictional universe for this type of game - the world has ended, the survivors are insane, and everyone fights over the remnants of what once was.   \n\n\nIn normal Battle Royale, you don't really have a reason to kill each other - you're just placed into this world and told to fight.  \n\n\nIn Mad Max, you fight to survive. You kill others to take their water, fuel and ammo. You HAVE to do this, or you WILL die. This isn't a Red vs. Blue type scenario where you are just killing the other dudes because they're not your dudes - this is a ""I need fuel to make it to the safe zone, and there's a car, it has fuel cans, so i have to take their fuel so I can survive"" sort of situation. It's just absolutely perfect.  \n\n\nAnyway... I think if a vehicular battle royale is to be done well, there's no better franchise than Mad Max to attach it to. "
ap8w09,Galaxy Wars: a Sci-Fi FPS,"In the year 2260, Earth is thriving. Pollution is at an all time low, war has ended, and advancements in technology are making people’s lives better worldwide. But across the galaxy, an alien empire known as the Krith, is realizing that their planet is dying. Fast. Using advanced portal technology, they warp to different parts of the galaxy, willing to do anything to find a place to make their home. That’s when they discover Earth. Oxygen filled atmosphere, vast oceans of water, a thick atmosphere. It was perfect for them. But the only problem was humanity. So they began their massive genocide that would result in the largest war in history. Earth put together the UEDC (United Earth Defense Corps) to fight off the alien invaders. But all of this fighting brought on the attention of another alien race. The Sqidari, the inhabitants of  the secluded world of Besteron, felt that this mass genocide was wrong, so they went to Earth to help the humans. They taught their soldiers to speak native human languages and sent them to Earth to fight alongside humanity. One of these soldiers is Terizoid Zajik Malzek, a skilled infantryman who can speak fluent American english. He joined Front-Line fireteam Alpha-64. This consists of Lisa Rodriguez (medic), Lucas Robinson (Sniper), Nathan Winter (Xenobiologist), Jeffery Pines (marine), and Tetrizoid. You play as Tetrizoid through and adventure that takes you across the war torn USA and into outer space to defeat the evil Krith empire!"
ap7dq6,Onimusha remake but in RE4's mold,"Onimusha was great for the time but I would wager a guess that a lot of people today are turned off by fixed cam perspectives and won't be so inclined to play them.  As much as I like the games, it's rightfully so.  There was a lot of combat cheese in the first two games because of the cameras.  \n\nIf the Onimusha trilogy were to be remade, I hope they give them all the RE2 remake treatment.  Rather than head/knee shot stuns being the conditional for QTE melee, they can be triggered by a successful dodgeroll or perfect defense.\n\nWhile I type this, I realize it's almost just like the new GoW.\n\nI was not a big of a fan of the Dinocrisis series but I guess giving this series the same treatment could be alright as well. Not sure what can be done to differentiate it from RE other than the statement ""it's RE but with dinosaurs"" which I guess is fine for many people but I'd rather that the interaction with a different creature type creates some deviation on mechanics."

ap0zi3,Aveus,"TL;DR- Anthem left me wanting something based around vertical traversal, but something that wasn’t going to be plagued with micro transactions (“just cosmetic” is not an excuse for a 60$ game). This is a fantasy MMO-lite in which you fly about as bird people, cataloging your discoveries, combatting wingless humanoids and aggressive flora/fauna, and exploring ancient ruins looking for treasure and ability altering runes. \n\nBase Game: \nYou play as villager in a mountain settlement, you and everyone in it belongs to a race of winged humanoids. You leave the safety of the Village to scout the surroundings and explore. You encounter aggressive wildlife, strange wingless humanoids who don’t take kindly to you, even deadly plants to fight. You also find ruins in which you must solve puzzles to reach the treasures at the end. This is an MMO-lite and so you’ll often be encountering and teaming up with other players. Some ruins even require multiple people just to get them open. Another large part of the game is customization, not in just appearance but play style. There are no classes, you simply develop the skills you want by using them more and more. There are also boss fights, where in you encounter a particularly formidable foe who rivals your own strength, even surpassing it in the end game. Enemies like a giant flying snake that pursues you into the sky, or giant crab that uses a hillside for a shell.\n\nSkill System: \nInstead of classes each player has access to three different trees. There’s the Tree of Valor, the Tree of Guile, and the Tree of Wisdom. Each tree contains two perks that open up the use of specialized weapons. You earn Valor points by defeating enemies in combat, you earn guile points when you defeat an enemy that was not aware of your presence, and also when you preform certain aerobatic maneuvers, you earn wisdom points when killing enemies with magic, when you discover runes, and when you solve puzzles.\n\nValor- this tree involves abilities and perks that boost your physical skills and allow you to preform devastating attacks like a dive bomb slam that deals AoE damage, and a wing flap that sends powerful gusts of air to knock down foes. The two Valor weapons are the Discus Buckler, a small shield that expands when used to block or when thrown, it bounces off enemies and returns to you. The other weapon is The Warhammer, a large Mjolnir like Weapon that seems to defy gravity, gaining and losing mass at your whim. Perks further down the line modify both the weapons attacks and your base attributes like health and damage resistance.\n\nGuile- this tree involves abilities and perks that boost your speed and allow you go by unseen with abilities that turn you invisible when in a shadow, and to fly silently like an owl. The two guile weapons are the Shadow Blades, a set of throwing knives with a seemingly endless supply, there is a recharge after you expend them all, but eventually they will return. The second being the Wing Blades, edged weapons that mount on your wings allowing graceful combat on the ground the ability to chop an enemy in two with a fly by. Perks later down the line influence things like the weapon attacks, as well as base attributes like movement speed, and luck (effects quality of the treasure you find).\n\nWisdom- this tree involves arcane abilities that allow you to call down lightning, cover yourself in flames, and it’s perks are things like reduced cast times and magical awareness (the ability to sense and locate magical objects and resources). The two Wisdom Weapons are the Wind Spear, a floating spear that you control muck like Yondu’s arrow in Guardians of the Galaxy, minus the whistling, you lock on to several targets and with the flick of your wrist the spear hunts them down and then returns to float by your side. And the Elemental Katars, (Bladed weapons from India that are kind of like if Wolverine just had one big claw) these weapons come in a variety of elemental types, and behave differently based on the elements. No matter the element however they are always able to fire small blasts of that type of element for a ranged attack, and the more attacks you string together the larger the blades of elemental energy become, and they deal more damage as well. Getting hit or not attacking for a certain amount and time returns them normal size and damage. Perks later down the line influence weapon performance and base attributes like cast times and elemental resistances. \n\nFlying Mechanics: \nThough it is a fantasy game the flying is based on more realistic mechanics. You’re wings are massive as they’d need to be to support a humans weight, you can’t hover for more than a few wing beats. To engage flight you simply need to gain enough altitude to begin a glide, to glide you press the L trigger. You then press the jump button in the air to flap your wings, three wing beats while in flight gets you to top speed. Pressing the R trigger brings your wings in allowing you to dive at great speed, or just fit through a narrow gap as a hawk would. The Bumpers preform a dodge roll to the left or right. While holding the L trigger and using a combination of the wing tuck, and the dodge rolls you can also preform more advanced maneuvers such as loops and Immelmanns (like a half loop where you rotate at the apex and fly the opposite direction you were headed). To preform a loop you fly vertically and then tuck your wings, as long as your hold the stick forwards/backwards you’ll flip in that direction, then untuck your wings and return to flying. An Immelmann simply has you using a dodge roll mod flip. All of these moves require precise timing and thus why preforming them earns you points in the Guile tree. \n\nLike all MMO-lites the search for loot is a large part of your customization process, not simply for the looks, but the effects they carry as well. You will find armor, learn sacred runes that when etched onto said armor and/or weapons that add even more perks. Some especially rare and powerful runes need to be combined for a new wild effect that drastically changes the way you play. For instance say instead of being able to target multiple people with the wind spear you can only target one, but it deals way more damage and if the target dies they explode damaging the enemies around them with the element of the wind spear you have equipped. There are also runes that can be applied to your wings with paint, these offer certain bonuses to flight like a bonus dodge roll, or in the rarer instance the ability to hover for a short time. \n\nCataloging Discoveries:\nThrough out the world there are unique specimens, they can be anything from a creature, a strange ancient statue, or a non-violent wingless humanoid who sells potions. There’s always only one unique specimen on the map at a time, and the map is quite large. When you discover it you can take that information back to the village for a hefty sum. If you’re in a party then the each member receives payment, the official discoverer earns slightly more. \n\nEnd Game: \nWhen you’ve completed the story and you’ve got your character all set up how you want, then what? Well at the end of the story one of the consequences is you awaken titan creatures all over the continent. These “boss battles” take place on smaller maps that are designed for those encounters specifically. They actually function a lot like Monster Hunter Quests. Villagers from other settlements come to you for aid, and because it is kind of your fault you have a responsibility to go and help them. You accept the quest go into matchmaking to put you in a team of 5. You’ll need all your skill and coordination with your team in order to defeat these massive beasts. Imagine fighting Rayquaza but you’re basically the size of a seagull. \n\nAnd to top it all off, No Micro transactions. There would be only be paid DLC, along with minor free updates that add new runes and stuff like that, but nothing that should have been in the game. Instead the game would simply use player feedback over time to then tailor experiences and updates based on their requests, to as reasonable a degree as possible of course. Despite what so many youtubers say, I think any micro transactions in an premium priced game are absolute horseshit. If you want a game to make money,  make a good game game, don’t design manipulative systems just to push people towards paying for useless content that should have been in your half baked game in the first place. Sadly I doubt there’s a single AAA publisher that would allow such a game to exist. Oh well, it’s still fun to dream."

aowpo1,Realistic Computer Systems in Sci-Fi Games,"One of the things I've always found daunting is the lack of computer networking in futuristic video games. Especially when considering how important the internet and online wiki's are today in learning about the game or in planning out your build. And ingame computers I have managed to played always seem to add a whole other dimension to gameplay outside of just crafting, looting and blowing shit up. A notable example being the Fallout Franchise. These computers weren't complex, but they were loosely based on a time before computers had interactive operating systems and really helped to pull together the whole 1950s vibe in the 2250s. You could use them to unlock rooms, or active systems within a Vault, or you could read the final entries and the lore of what happened to these places as the world began to fall apart. You could even hack into them depending on your skill in order to take control of robots, security systems or to find rare loot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYet despite ingame computers having so many interesting and entertaining applications, and out of game wikis, forums, or even youtube becoming so necessary in order to learn and maximize your ingame experience, no game really combines these two. And many gamers are left to alt-tab throughout their game experience or rely on their cellphones for quick searches while the game developers themselves do little effort to convey this information ingame. And often times user generated content and networking take up as much more of the players time than actually playing the game.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBelow are a list of a few examples that collaboratively I think could really help to flesh out ingame computers, networking, and local internet/s.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\*\*Wikis\*\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWikis are largely user generated and have changed the way we play games. Almost everything from the most common goods to the rarest drops or easter eggs will find their way onto a wiki. But what if this content was accessible ingame? Now I've bounced this idea before, and it generally doesn't tend to land very well, but hear me out. Sometimes in games when you find a new item it gives you a brief cryptic description as if you're expected to try it out and see if it works for you. But nobody does that. Because if that item happens to have let say high crit and you didn't realize, you're not maximizing on its potential and end up missing out on a huge chunk of the game. But what if you could just search your database for it? Or connect to a relay that has that data? In fact, it could add a whole new dimension to identifying items. You could find them and not know what it is at all. No text no name nothing. It would still look like the item though. But once you identify it through your network, presuming you haven't encountered it before, then it displays its name and some basic stats, while the ingame database would have pages of strategies and content directly taken from the wiki, and that gets added to as players become more involved. You could even sell hand held identifiers, but they'll only be able to identify items of certain rarities and that have to be upgraded for higher rarities. Almost like buying maps in some games.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\*\*Forums\*\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA lot like wikis, forums have become a pivotal part of interacting with players and getting quality advice on composing your builds. But what if that companies forums were accessible both via a web browser OR ingame? And could be displayed on your ship viewscreen, or ingame computer display. It could add an extra interactive dimension without breaking the illusion of playing in a futuristic setting. Its one thing to be able to message players directly, or send messages to their inbox, but what if you wanted to post a request on the network of a particular planet, where all those people are simultaneously using the same network because its available to them and they all happen to be doing the same quests? It would bring the game that much more to life if you could communicate with them ingame and then meet up with them irl... ingame. NPCs can even post quests here in support of off-worlders looking for work, making the game that more immersive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\*\*Gameplay/Letsplay (Historical Records)\*\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is the last of the real world internet application I'm going to discuss, and yes I am referencing GalaxyQuest. Letsplays and gameplay videos for certain items/attacks generate a lot of content on youtube. But what if you could turn on a tv ingame, flip through the channels, and all of that content (but only specific to that game) was available as if the game has an culture all on its own? Again completing the illusion that the ingame world is more than just hacking slashing and grinding. If you need to know more about item and the tutorial didn't quite answer what you were looking for, just access the ""historical records"" to see if there are any other submissions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\*\*Trading\*\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTrading is something that varies a lot across games. From auction houses to simple trade chats, sometimes there are tight controls with fees, and sometimes its a hysterical mess of text and dozens of people posting WTB or WTS in all caps into a single chat box. But what if you could access an interplanetary relay and the trade setup resembled something much more familiar? Like Amazon or Craigslist. Or at least an ingame version of it using ingame currency. A part of what would make these systems more realistic is if they resembled systems that we already heavily rely on today. Like posting ads or listings. If you go with an expensive provider they'll stock your items and do the shipping for you, for a fee. Or you could get in contact with players directly and go to them. This second one would generate more than just a realistic ingame networking experience, it could also provide an incentive to travel across vast distances, almost like a quest in pursuit of a reward. Except the reward is whatever you're looking for, and the quest giver is a real person that you can haggle with. An example of this I really liked, but could still use some fleshing out, was EVE Online. In EVE you would be able to purchase items within your sector but that could still be 10 jumps away. spending hours trying to get to the station station you didn't realize your product was on. But as irritating as these jumps were they added to the ingame content and helped to cement the illusion that your purchase was a tangible object rather than just data that would instantly and magically be in your inventory upon purchase.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\*\*Ship to Ship Communication\*\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMany of us who grew up with Star Trek are all too familiar with ship to ship communication. What if instead of an annoying chat box covering the bottom corner of your screen you were able to directly contact a neighboring ship, send out an unencrypted warning or distress call on all channels, or even eaves drop of someone else's communication while you're hidden or cloaked. Ship to ship communication would not only make ingame communication that much more immersive, but add a whole slew of other implications from organizing large scale armadas that wouldn't involve everyone exchanging their discord usernames to espionage. You could even implement a discord like system where your avatar would mouth your words as you say them, and communicate from ship to ship via view-screen, or just talk out loud in game but instead of everyone in the region instantly seeing your text its limited by range just like real sound is, meaning louder sounds are closer and therefore more relevant to you. And headsets, handheld or wrist communicators would still be useful for communicating with your party while in the middle or a mission or contacting your ship when on an alien world. Ideally everything you do ingame should have some way of doing it. Chat boxes have always kind of broken that illusion for me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\*\*Different Operating Systems for Different Ships\*\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne of the things that kind of bugs me about a lot of games is how ship controls are basically just menus. A lot like hitting your esc key and changing your controls, video or audio settings. But what if every ship had a unique operating system depending on its company or version. You'd see a quick start up and then an onscreen desktop that displays systems and subsystems like you classic sci-fi helm control. And then when you upgrade to a new ship, you get a slightly upgraded version that alludes to game lore if you're savvy enough to look for it. With different companies/species using different operating systems. Otherwise it can just as easily be a background element that you don't put much thought into but behind the scenes is one more element that contributes to a seamless ingame experience. But as far as I'm concerned instead of chat boxes, credits, or exp permanently taking up space on your hud display and occluding your vision, all of this content should be on an ingame display of some kind making the game that much more realistic. Unless you have some kind of VR interface, most of us don't see letters and item names just floating above items. And as practical as that might be ingame, its a shortcut that takes away from the immersive experience of being in a futuristic setting, when this could be an opportunity to make these games more futuristic by being creative and finding a practical ingame means for displaying this information.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\*\*Authoritarian Worlds and Great Firewalls\*\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI mentioned forums on different planets and potentially interacting with local NPCs online when you visit different worlds. Not only would this add an interesting element to exploring ingame lore, current events, and dynamics of these different worlds, it also offers an interesting setting to critique our own differences in networking and technology. Many governments have different approaches to managing information. For allied species for example they might be in contact with each other despite having their own culture and laws. Therefore no matter how far you travel you're still connected to a cosmic network and can communicate with your peers across sovereign boundaries. But what about behind enemy lines? Or on authoritarian regimes that censor free information? You could land on an alien work only to find that they have a very different perception of outsiders that polarizes them against your way of life. Parodying some of the social tensions in the real world. Establishing this seamless ingame experience offers opportunities to break this perception once you begin delving deeper into some of the seedier elements of the game. And high level missions could require you to infiltrate one of these isolated worlds with their own missions and npcs but that would require you to sneak your way into a communications tower to call for backup, or steal a ship in order to escape. And open the eyes of the player to differences in how free information is regulated not just in game but in real life too. These isolated worlds could have their own isolated news stations, or their own isolated economies that you would have to travel between if you wanted to explore them or take advantage or smuggle goods between them for a little extra cash. You could even have warring factions with players on both side, with each side spreading their own brand of propaganda revving up the player against the rival economy. Which would create a perfect setting for an  illicit trade and bounty hunter system, pitting players against players at the command of NPC run governments for generating dynamic content.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\*\*Hacking\*\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally, I couldn't talk about ingame computers without addressing hacking. Games like Bioshock, Mass Effect, Fallout, and Warframe all make extensive use of minigames for accessing security systems or quest objectives. Games like Thie Witness, which is essentially just one giant minigame, are fun even without the rest of the content. And while in many of these games hacking minigames tend to be simple and straight forward, difficult, albeit optional minigames could really help to establish hacking as a valuable skill in these games. An old half life 2 mod comes to mind called Dystopia. In Dystopia you have your classic team based pvp format. Some builds rely on heavy weapons or speed, but some rely on hacking, and the game can't progress if you don't have hackers that are willing to jack in and hack security systems or weapons for you. Dystopia however takes this to another level by rendering an entire 3 dimensional digital world in addition to of the 3 dimensional over-world. While jacked in players can encounter enemy hackers or security systems and fight while jacked in for control. And if they lose their connection they'll have to navigate the whole network again or get locked out. Dystpia's version definitely needed work, but applying this in an mmo would be incredible. Especially if you'd have to rely on it in order to escape an oppressive regime. Complex minigames are welcome when it comes to hacking and deserve a lot of attention when developing a game. Every operating system could have its own minigame that increases with difficulty as the version increases. Simple systems might be accessible for an amature, but hijacking a cruiser on the other hand could be an optional extra that requires heavy support, time and skill but for one hell of a payoff.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, these are just a few ideas about how today's growing technology could be applied ingame in order to expand on both seamless immersion as well as some of the epic intersectional conflicts that many of us have only read in books or seen in movies. Or just to explore and critique some of the growing fears and concerns on Orwellian police states and other more eerily real world examples that may exist today or the near future. Even the South Park games do a great job at exploring social media and applying it in a practical and relatable manner ingame. Applying that in a sci-fi themed MMO would no doubt generate interest while also a generating a immersive, relatable world that could one day potentially exist."
aotqae,Harem Anime Protagonist Simulator,"A tongue in cheek simulation game, like the Sims, in which the player creates his/her own character, including customizing its appearance and picking a special power.\n\nThe player controls the daily life of the character (who is a Japanese high schooler, of course), on home, school, club activities, part time job, etc.\n\nDuring gameplay, some random enemies will target the player - demon lords, secret organizations, the yakuza, aliens, robots, delinquents, etc. The player's character will fight those enemies using its special power.\n\nMeanwhile, characters of the opposing gender of the character (and traps as well) will show up and fall in love with the player's character.\n\nEventually those love interests end up living with the player's character, who will have to protect and take care of them (including feeding them and help them study).  The player's character doesn't need to do this all by himself/herself, as he/she can ask the love interests to do tasks.\n\nThe love interests will have different skills and personalities. The player will have to make its character interact with the love interests in order to increase their affection, otherwise they won't do the tasks requests by the player.\n\nThe game would have a light hearted tone, as it would be a satire on harem animes."
aot77v,RTS meets City Builder,"(Compatible with my previous idea: https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/aniq8y/rts_with_fully_customisable_factions_buildings/)\n\nThis idea is an attempt to create a RTS like Age of Empires with elements from City Building games like the Caesar/Pharaoh series or Tropico. This has been done before with games like Stronghold or The Settlers; my idea is another way of mixing the two genres.\n\nThe gameplay is mostly like Age of Empires or Age of Mythology, but with the following features:\n\nFirst, the player controls a hero unit; the player loses if that unit is killed. That hero unit is customisable. The player would be able to directly cast spells / skills.\n\nLike most RTS games, while military and civilian units may act automatically, the player has the power to directly control them (both military and civilian).\n\nThere are separated population caps for civilian units and military units. Example: each house built would increases both caps by, say, 10. That means 10 military units and 10 civilian units; 20 in total.\n\nEach unit (both civilian and military) consumes 1 point of food for every X minutes. If you don't have enough food, each unit will get -1 damage.\n\nOn the other hand, when training units, the players would never need to spend food. In fact, the players would only spend food to feed their population, food would not be needed for anything else. \n\nOn top of food, other resources would be money, stone, wood, metal textiles. This would be spent to build buildings and train units. \n\nStone, wood, metal and textiles would also be raw materials that would be transformed (in workshops) into finer goods that could be sold and/or consumed by civilian units.\n\nSo, on top of the typical RTS buildings, the player would be able to build those workshops to transform raw material into finer goods: blacksmith for metal, carpenter for wood, taylor for textile and potter for stone (as stone would also represent clay).\n\nOther buildings would include services such as a school, a hospital, a church, a court, etc. This would give the player special benefits, including the ability to train special units such as teachers, doctors, priests or judges. \n\nThese units, on top of running their buildings, would each have a special ability, a 'spell' they would cast: priests would convert enemy units to your side; teachers would temporarily duplicate the speed, range, attack and defence of your units; doctors would heal damaged units; judges would temporarily freeze ('arrest') enemy units, etc.\n\nA very important concept, however, would be happiness. The happiness of the player's population would range from 0% to 100%. Failing to feed the population would vastly decrease happiness. On the other hand, providing finer goods and services (schools, churches, hospitals, etc) to the civilian units would increase their happiness.\n\nHappiness would correlate with criminality rate. The lowest the happiness, the highest the probability of units (both civilian and military) becoming criminals/rebels. \n\nThese rebellious units would not be controlled by the player and would act as enemies, attacking other units. Other units would also treat them as enemies: military units would attack them; as for civilians, they would defend themselves if attacked. \n\nThe player would be able to launch decrees that would impact the game, including happiness, the buildings and units available, the spells and skills the player can cast, and also some general benefits / effects. But these decrees would always have a downside or a cost.\n\nAn example of decree would be taxes: the player would control how many taxes people pay, which would generate money for the player. But taxes would also decrease happiness. \n\nHappiness would also impact productivity and the power of military units. Happy units would have an attack and defence bonus; unhappy units would have reduced stats. \n\nAs for productivity: usually, let's say a villager gets 10 points of wood every time he/she brings a log to the lumberyard. But an unhappy villager will only generate 8 points per log while a happy one will generate 12 points, for example. \n\nOk, I've already written too much. I could expand this idea further, but I guess you get the idea. It's mostly a modified Stronghold, basically."

aom7s7,A Multiplayer War game where each player is one part of the tank crew.,"This idea is kind of inspired by Star Trek Bridge Crew. Basically one player is the commander who gets orders from the operation base and can go out of the cupola and might get hit by snipers, one is the gunner who aims the turret, machine gunner who uses the machine gun on infantry,  and the driver who...drives. Maybe the infantry would be actual people and  maybe they would be NPCs but any way it would be great as a first person game for tank fans "
aok8fb,RPG where you play as a zombie trying to discover their past life,"Pretty much just what it says up there. I imagine the game would work best as a first-person game where you don't even know what you look like at first. The game starts with the zombie waking up and crawling out of a grave or something before shambling off, curious to discover its past. It'd have aspects kind of like a Metroidvania, where you're able to better interact with the world as you slowly learn to open doors, read, and communicate.\n\nThe world have story cookie crumbs that you have to follow, as well as human characters that you can try to interact with, or eat. How all of that would work is still pretty rough in my head, and I'm not sure how it would work storywise. I'm thinking there may be a dichotomy to be had with character progression: Where you can choose to become more human so you can talk and reunite with your people, or become more undead and become extremely strong and durable.\n\nThat's just my rough idea, I think it'd be cool."

ao9z4y,Business Simulator/Roleplay,"I've searched for something like this, and I've found similar concepts, but nothing quite like it. What if you had a game where you control an avatar similar to that of Second Life or The Sims, but which prioritizes becoming an employee of another company, or starting your own. This would obviously include some sort of virtual currency. You could have sim businesses all competing, a sim government to make laws and tons and tons of sim careers. These would all be controlled by people in the game. The structure would allow for hundreds and hundreds of different kinds of businesses, which would probably take a lot of work. The game should incentivize the purchase of necessary products by threat of idk... dying without groceries, shelter, electricity etc. This would already guarantee a market for supercenters and housing companies. I haven't thought of a way to incentivize players to purchase luxury, non-essential products, however. \n\n\nIs this already a thing, cause I feel like it could make a pretty enjoyable game. "
ao6v6k,A gamification app with a roguelike rpg attached,"I've got a long nagging todo list and was looking at [gamification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification) apps to see if I could start tackling things.  All the ones I see have different ways of leveling up and tackling quests, but the most you get out of it is a few badges and better character pictures.\n\nWhat I'd like is a gamification app tied to a rpg game, where the more you achieve your goals and tasks the stronger the character you're building becomes. And you can take that character on dungeon runs to see how it performs. \n\nIf you got to be really fancy you could categorize your todos so that you could increase different rpg aspects and wealth, i.e. Tackle diet goals, gain agility. Go for a run gain constitution. Do a work project, gain gold coins. \n\nI enjoy rpgs and am motivated to grind out tasks to beat the next boss.  If those tasks were set up in real life, I would probably still do them if the rpg was fun enough.\n"

(E.g. 2 players per phone)\n\nThere can be graphics or it can be text based.  \nHere are some sources of inspiration that I've looked at and hope can paint a better idea of what I'm looking for:  \n\n\n&gt;[Spyfall](https://spyfall.crabhat.com/) \--- Spyfall is 1 vs Rest party game where all players are given a location and role, the non-spies have to figure out who the spy is and the spy has to figure out what is the given location. The first player gets to ask any other player a single question, afterwhich its that players turn to ask a question. (E.g. Are there more men or women in this location on average?) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;[Codenames](https://www.horsepaste.com/) \--- Codenames is a red vs blue team game. Each team chooses a spymaster at the start of the game and they take turns. All players in the team are given an NxN tiled board with various words on them. Each tile on the board are colored: Red, Blue, Black and Grey. Only the spymaster can see the colors of each tile and it is the spymasters job to give hints to their team to pick all the tiles of their team's color. Grey tiles cause the team to immediately pass their turn and black tiles causes the team to immediately lose the round/game. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;[Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes](https://keeptalkinggame.com/) \--- A team based game where players are split into 2 groups, the manual team and the bomb defusal team. The bomb defusal team is tasked to defuse a bomb within a time limit. The bomb has multiple puzzles that can only be solved by describing the puzzle to the manual team, which, can use the manual to solve the puzzles. This game requires communication from both teams to describe what they see (on the bomb and in the manual).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese games are great but are generally too complicated for kids &lt; 10 years old. (Based only on my experience when playtesting with my younger sister aged 10)\n\n  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;"
ao1asy,"A VR game in which you keep putting on more ""VR headsets"" deeper into increasingly abstracted virtual worlds (Inception-style).","The game starts in the first ""layer"" in a realistic looking room with a human NPC playing some cool VR game. They take off their VR headset, hand it to you and insist you try out the game. Once you put it on you enter the game's second ""layer"".\n\nEach time you do, the world you enter is more abstracted/surreal and the gameplay is more fun.\n\nThe first layer was a mostly boring room with a few things to interact with, while several layers down you're trying to fix a spaceship by entering its mainframe through a VR device, and yet even further down you're fighting a polygonal cyberdragon to reach the magical knight's cyber-helmet to go yet another layer deeper. Once you beat the game, you start taking off the helmets one by one until you reach the real world.\n\nWhat's the point?\n\nEverybody has at some point wondered if their whole world is just some TV show or movie. Something like The Truman Show. But since the shows/movies we watch are way more exciting than real life, *it must mean that whoever is watching your life must live in an even more boring world than yours.*\n\nThe game would be about planting that showerthought in the player's head without explicitly saying it.

ao00ch,4X Space strategy Total war style,"New to reddit in general but I've sunk countless hours into large scale strategy games like the Total War series, Empire at War, Sins of a Solar Empire, and Homeworld and I've found that there's a lack of combination between them. Something like Stellaris has a good model but isn't quite tactical enough when it comes to fleet battles. \nA game with the turn based layout of a total war game but on a ""galactic"" scale (obviously not too immense then it gets tedious) with fleets and planets but with a homeworld style of tactical combat when fleets meet. I know I don't speak for everyone who enjoys the genre when I say I'm not a fan of giant tech trees and planet management but I find it more interesting when there is a relatively stagnant tech level and beating opposing races are dependent on asymetric technologies being used creatively, somewhat like total war Warhammer. Something like 9 unique races fighting for the galaxy in this fashion would be a lot of fun and I haven't had much luck finding anything that really fits this model save for sword of the stars 2(and that game is near unplayable with bugs). Empire at war was really cool for having land battles as well but those were a bit lackluster and while that would be a cool feature, it seems kind of unlikely that that could be truly engaging. Hopefully I'm not just describing stellaris dumbed down but I haven't seen much of this."
anxz7p,A card game called Auctioneer,"I'm playing with a concept for a 2 to 4 player game played with a standard deck of cards, pens, and paper. Looking for feedback.\n\nThe aces are removed and shuffled face down. Each player picks one and views it. That's their suit.\n\nEach player begins with a budget of $1000 fictional dollars. \n\nA card is flipped up from the deck and that card is up for auction. Each player writes how much they're willing to bid for that card.\n\nBidders write an even number of $20 or greater. \n\nThe player with the highest bid wins the card. That bidder must deduct that amount from their $1000 budget. Losers always deduct $20.\n\nIf there is a tie, there is another round of betting. Players must increase their score from the last round. The player with the highest score wins the card. If ties continue, rounds contine in this same way until someone wins the card.\n\nIf you elect not to bid, $10 is deducted from your account. If no one bids on a card, another card is flipped and there are two items up for auctioned together in the next round.\n\nWhen a person no longer has sufficient funds to bid $20, they are out. If other players have at least $20, they may continue bidding. Even if only one player remains, they continue to play until their account has less than $20.\n\nScoring\nONE POINT - you win a 2 through 10 card that is not your suit\nTWO POINTS - a face card that is not your suit\nTHREE POINTS - a 2 through 10 card that is your suit\nFIVE POINTS - a face card that is your suit\n\nEach player tallies the value of their cards and the highest wins the game.\n\nIn the event of a tie, the player with the most cards of their own suit wins.\n\n...interested in your thoughts!"
anw5ip,Side Scrolling Action Game with Combos triggered by drawing shapes with mouse/touch,"So basically this would be a 2D / side scrolling game, more specifically a platformer with some fighting game features. \n\nThe main feature is that combos (and also spells, skills, etc) would be activated by drawing specific shapes on the screen (with the mouse, on computer; with the finger, on mobile). In fact, maybe some of the basic movements would also be triggered by drawing as well. \n\nThe simplest attacks / movements would be triggered by drawing horizontal or vertical lines. For example, a bottom to top line would make the character jump, a top to bottom line would make the character drop from the current platform. A left to right line would activate an attack to the right and vice versa. \n\nMore complex combos or skills would be activated by drawing circles, squares, triangles, zigzags, pentagrams, etc...\n\nAnd that's it. It's a simple idea that has probably been implemented before, even though I was unable to find an example."
anuykx,New Final Fantasy,"I liked ff7. I replayed it last year and analyzed the pros of the game. I found the story and characters to be a key in the game. The storytelling and character building was presented in this very small format; blue text boxes and really simple animations, and beautiful music to match. With this format you got to use a lot of imagination. But it was made with care. It was closer to reading a book than most other games.\n\nI dream of a new final fantasy game that embraces this old style of walk-talk gameplay. One static background at a time. Minimalistic. Totally ignoring the technical advantage of 2019. And the writing should be in focus, personal, funny, non-prestigeous, like ff7. Background images perfect in photography.\n\nThen, a fight begin and the 2d background warps to 3d life, revealing the 3d model of the current stage that was there all along. With all the new impressive graphics of today. \n\nThis way the game switches between old and new repetetivly.\n\nAnd the character/monster 3d models could be low polygon also but with cooler lighting and other graphic enhancements.\n\n\n"

anoyem,Game idea Discussion," \n\nFor a college project we have come up with 3 different game ideas in which to take into production, although we are unsure on which one to choose. Would it be possible for you to give us some feedback on each idea and tell us what idea would be the best to pursue.\n\n***TL;DR included for all ideas***\n\n**Game Idea 1: The Bountyless**\n\nA small group of misfit bounty hunters get the bounty of a lifetime to kill a powerful dictator. They are joined by an assassin with a personal grudge against the leader but a blurred past and makes the once fun atmosphere more militarized, annoying the team leader. After taking out the target they reveal a deeper conspiracy and have to decide to either unravel it for the greater of the people or carry on with your bounty hunter ways.\n\nYou can play the game with up to 3 other people with local co-op (split screen) and choose from the members of the team, each having their own abilities and roles to support their friends. The other players aren't tied to player 1 like other games. They have the freedom to go anywhere in the level they want and even take separate missions to player 1. Despite this, they are also strong enough alone to be able to play the game solo. The game plays like an immersive sim RPG like that of Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic or Deus Ex and will allow you to solve things without fighting, with stealth, or by hitting it head on with full force. you also get a chance to form bonds with each of the team and to find out more about their past and how they came to join the team.\n\n***TL;DR: Your team compete with other teams to take get cash in on the highest bounty in history.***\n\n**Game Idea 2: Operation: Black Book**\n\nYou are a black ops assassin that has been abandoned by your country. You decide to build a team to get revenge that is based on a ship that you are able to upgrade and improve as the years go on. You are able to attack other NPCs and player ships to gather resources and go down a research tree. You can take the ship all the way from 1968 to the 3000s so that you can have spaceships.\n\nYou are able to make extensive plans and build interesting teams to either destroy or steal from other players. It's a ship version of Day Z with a large open ocean and islands to explore and build up more and more resources and weaponry to keep you safe and to combat others.\n\n***TL;DR: You build up a ship, boat based day z***\n\n**Game Idea 3: Mind Shifted**\n\nYou are an assassin bot made by a galactic government to take out targets that threaten their power. After a botched assassination you are discovered and the government is forced to declare that you are not theirs and you become a fugitive. You are now forced to flee from the law enforcement and either build up to take revenge violently or to instead take revenge by exposing the corrupt leaders, all you need is solid evidence.\n\nYou use a ship as a mobile command centre and travel to different planets either helping people or taking assassination requests. All in the name of getting you closer to your revenge.\n\n***TL;DR: Revenge on your creators.***\n\nThank you for taking your time to read this and any input would really help us."
ano6jw,An open world game idea,"An open world game idea, I just wanted to share my idea with other people.\n\nAn open world game where there would be all types of regions, Grass, Snow, Underworld, Desert, Hidden islands.\n\nPlayers all start at level 1 and they get to higher levels the more they eliminate monsters or criminal players. Criminal players become criminals by betraying squads and killing them. Or choosing to become one.\n\nThere will be high level monsters which carry rare/legendary items and if a player defeats them they keep the items. But when a player dies with rare/legendary items they will drop it but the other player that collected it must reach a higher level then the previous owner. And the player that died will keep their high level but the monster they fight will be higher level then the noob monsters. \n\nPlayers can create or join groups to stay together and fight as one but all items they get will be sold and split profits. But if one player did most damage to the monster they get to have a choice to keep it or sell it and split it with your team.\n\nHigh level players can get special unique skills that is either magic or physical. They obtain these by killing certain elite monsters from the underworld.\n\nWeapons will be melee, magical/enchanted weapons which are either swords,bows and other stuff. There will be legendary weapons that are op and very very hard to get and must be a certain level and have certain skills to use it. \n\nLegendary clothing: Invisible cloak turns you invisible when wearing it. Attack resistant cloak which will stop 90% of magical attack damage. And a cloak that teleports you in places you’ve been before.\n\nThat all I have thought of as of today but I’ll keep you guys up to date with any ideas I have, also please comment any bad ideas. I just came up with this game idea today and I am still thinking for more stuff. If you want daily/weekly updates lmk.\n\n"

The main difference would be that  each and every choice you make in the game would be of consequence, and  steer the story accordingly; without exceptions. Thus, hopefully, giving  you a more depth, meaningful and an overall richer experience. It would  also bear novel-esk traits (complexity, etc.), but would be mostly a  text based adventure, with some animated/dynamic elements (and appealing  art) on the side; much like those good-old game books had. It would use  the latest Unreal Engine, and would be published in an episodic format  (plus to prove that the concept is viable, etc.), if the project gets  green lit. The story would be set in a medieval fantasy/fable, where no  magic exists . . . or as we thought. It would be our choice of mission  to investigate and explore what lies beyond the known borders of  humanity.\n\nI'm  no artist by any means, just a humble wordsmith, who's a ""bit""  different. But decided nonetheless to make a promo video for it, which  you can find: [click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEubZO4F-3Q)\n\nAnd  a little about me, the short version: been a gamer since forever, did  some modding, modeling, etc. back in the day, and always wanted to make a  game of my own.

It is a Silvixen, known for being extra cunning and having an interesting cry, but this one looks dirty and malnourished.  He takes pity on the creature and leaves his post to check on it. They bond overnight, and it opens up to him. Jared starts talking to her, and she responds? However the creature says that it is normal for her race to speak in many different ways. Jared decides to, when the morning comes, smuggle her to his home. This works, and he learns alot or new and interesting things about these races. Humans have been capturing and brainwashing Beasts with a mysterious new device, and they are retaliating on the entire Human race.  The 2 venture off to find answers to many of their questions.\n\n# Gameplay:\n\nThe game is a turn-based RPG with many recruitable party members. You start out with Jared and Silvixen, but you can get alot more, oh, and Jared is actually a party member with a huge selection of exclusive items! Each beast has an upgraded form that is basically like a Pokemon Evolution.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI need a good title for this, help me out!"

aro90u,"A bowser, peach, and waluigi game.","I was talking to my brother about mario and we figured that each charactor needs their own game. Mario has well you know. Luigi has luigis mansion. Wario has wario ware. But weres peaches game. Or bowsers game! OR WALUIGIS GAME?!?!  So me and my brother figured out a few good ideas for their games.\n\nBowser RPG\nBowsers game would be a continuation of the mario rpg games. I havent played them so ill just give a basics on the story. Bowsers children have been captured by a dark creature and he needs to save them. Youll start out with allies like goomba and boos but eventually mario hears whats happened and comes to help. I feel like a lot of people would be happy with this becaise its an mario rpg game and a new idea.\n\nWaluigis wonderful park\nThis game would be like rollar coaster tycoon. Exept nintendo based, and you play as waluigi. The game can have a freeplay mode and a story mode. Thats about all.\n\nPeach's payback\nIn this game you play as peach, in a mech. Your trying to reclaim your castle from bowser by fighting of his armies in a mech. It would be part hack and slash and platformer. During some fights you set your mech to auto pilot and run on its moving body to infiltrare rhe other mech. It would be something fun and different.\n"
arn4lf,I HAVE JUST HAD THE GREATEST IDEA EVER FOR A GAME,"I have just had the greatest idea ever for a game. Imagine a generic first person shooter but instead of losing hitpoints and dying when they reach zero, you lose frames per second. You start at 60 frames per second and for every hit you take you lose one (or more) frame until it reaches 0 and you die. Conversely, if you hit someone, you gain one frame per second (or you steal one from the player you hit). **THIS IDEA IS WORTH AT THE VERY LEAST 10 DOLLARS ON STEAM STORE.**\n"
arjg3x,A humerous RPG game where you have to escape a dark fantasy world.,"**Story**\n\nYou are a normal person who grew up as an orphan.You grew up with no clue about the  whereabouts of your biological parents.Until one fateful day, a demonic being appears in front of you and claims that you are actually a prince/princess of the fantasy world of Grimdrak.According to the creature, you were sent here to avoid being assassinated by one of your royal parent's many, many enemies.Now you have to return to the world of Grimdrak to save it from a army of undead orcs lead by an extremely seductive necromancer succubus.\n\n\nYour troubles arise when actually arrive on  Grimdrak, when you realize everything the demon told you  (expect for Grimdrak being in grave danger) was utter bullshit.After a cutscene of you cursing his name, you finally set out on the epic quest to return to your world.Saving Grimdrak is completely optional.\n\n**Gameplay** \n\n\nIt would be an  isometric in order to that nostalgic feel of older RPG's like old Fallout, Arcanum, etc.Their would be many traits and skills, and there also be perk system similar to Fallout games.The game world is mostly open world and like many good RPGs their is a lot of NPCs you can romance, ~~even~~ especially the super sexy necromancer succumbus."
arhbr7,Bass Blaster,"I always wanted to make a game called Bass Blaster, where you choose one of three characters: Flea (Red Hot Chili Peppers) Geddy Lee (RUSH) or Cliff Burton (Metallica) all of whom have their own basses as their weapons. The Bass shoots a laser out of the head, and it’s played as an 8 bit side scroller, and you kill enemy band members while picking up notes to charge your special moves. The bosses would also be bassists from other bands, and you would also have 8 bit covers playing in the background, and those would be different for each character. It looks so cool in my head but I lack skill and motivation to do it."

ar7q92,A mecha bullet hell in which you use each analog stick to control two flying mechs simultaneously.,"Like a cross between *Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons* and *Ikaruga*, one analog controls a ""light"" mech impervious to light attacks and the other controls a ""dark"" mech impervious to dark attacks. As such, you'll often position one ship to shield attacks for the other.\n\nOne of the abilities you have is make your mechs swap position with each other through ""Entangling"": Bringing your mechs together and pulling them apart will make a faint beam of energy between the two. At the press of a button they will teleport to each other's place and release the entanglement. Any enemies that were caught in the middle will be obliterated.\n\nThe gameplay would focus on controlling your mechs in tandem for bullet hell combat and light puzzle solving.\n\nFor example, an dark energy wall/barrier could prevent your light mech from crossing. As the stage auto scrolls, this threatens to kill you. So you bring your dark mech back, entangle both mechs, cross over the dark barrier with the dark mech, then disentangle them to teleport your light mech through. All while in combat too.\n\n#### For decades, Earth has been defending itself against an enigmatic alien onslaught.\n\nYou play as a pair of twins who were separated at birth, lived completely different lives, and were selected to pilot prototype mechs due to their high compatibility/affinity with the mechs. In order to save the Earth, they have to set aside their resentment toward each other to make a frontal assault on the aliens' home planet.\n\nThroughout the course of the game, the twins discover some dark secrets. Their prototype mechs were a decades long project using the light/dark quantum entanglement technology stolen from the aliens. Eventually they discover that not only were they part of this project from birth, but also that they were literally separated at birth to this end. They aren't twins, but rather one child split in two.\n\nIt's a love letter to mecha anime like Macross and Evangelion and classic SHMUPs like Section-Z and R-Type. But also Ikagura and Brothers, of course."
ar72qn,A pixel art game focusing on a civilian's life in a futuristic universe where we are settling on Mars.,"The game I've been thinking about features a German man named Klaus who recently shifted to Mars in the year 3019. It was predicted that a meteorite will soon hit Earth and it was necessary for the humans to shift to Mars which had then been stabilised and made available for humans to live in. At mars, Klaus finds himself working as a volunteer at a water extraction plant (ample reserves of water were found beneath mars' crust). Due to a severe water shortage that follows due to the space authority limiting water extraction, klaus is forced to venture to an illegal site to look for water. Right when he thinks he had found water, he finds a memory card lying there. It had been the memory card to his digital diary. He loads it up and finds his family photo featuring his wife and young son. He looks over at earth which can be seen in the sky and the screen goes blank. It is hinted to the player over the course of time that klaus made it to mars but his family didn't. He often travels to the space station to look for his family in the arriving spacecrafts carrying people from earth to mars. In his pursuit of finding his family, his house is seized by the space authority as Klaus does not work for the mandatory social service every civilian is supposed to do on mars. Now homeless, a family similar to his own helps him out to get his house back (through legal means obviously). In this chapter, the player gets to know a lot about Klaus's life on earth as he interacts with the family. Norman then calls up klaus and tells him about a retired scientist who might be able to build up a private spacecraft and look for Klaus's family. Klaus finds the man and helps him out in building the spacecraft. It is hinted to the player that the scientist has a mental disorder and might just not be reliable. Although this is evident, the man is Klaus's best bet. But unfortunately, on one fine day when the spacecraft is ready to take off and some hired men are called to go on a private mission to find Klaus's family, it gets to everyone's notice that the scientist took off with the spacecraft himself to escape from the space authority's grasp since he had been a criminal. Disheartened, klaus cheats on his friend norman and gets access to one of the space authority's spacecraft. He risks his own life having no knowledge about spacecrafts but still taking off himself looking for his family. Soon after he takes off, an announcement is made declaring that all of the human population that survived has been transferred to mars and the meteorite will reportedly hit earth within the next 24 hours."

ar5eea,The Silver Equus,"(First post here, please feel free to give criticism)\n\n......................................................................................................\n\n(1976. Somewhere within the rural fields and valleys of country-side Pennsylvania, lies one of the greatest, most elaborate, and most secretive hotel the world has ever known)\n\nThe Hotel Silver Equus.\n\nDesigned to be one of the most elaborate, and most high-class hotels ever seen, the hotel is built by the world-renowned, New Orleans born designer Jericho Louis. The hotel is designed to be his crowning achievement, an experiment in new architectural design, opulence, and beauty, as well as a milestone in hotels everywhere. Boasting everything from an art gallery, full-scale theater, five-class bar-with a 3 drink minimum!- as well as even a fully equipped spa, the hotel's true allure was its location.\n\nYou see, the Silver Equus was built entirely underground.\n\nBuilt below a series of natural caverns and abandoned coal mines, the Silver Equus is built into the elaborate rock formations, caverns, and tunnels, combining the Art-Deco architecture into elaborate rock displays. Guests can admire the stalagmite spires hanging from the ceiling in the lobby, enjoy a drink beneath a spring waterfall, and even bathe in the steaming mineral spas underneath a crystal sky. \n\nFor seven years, the hotel was only word of mouth, popular among only the ritziest classes and rumored to be a legend to those not in the know. Here, was a place to express one's self through art, music, design, and theater or find a new life to begin, far from the world outside. \n\nThat, however, was long ago.\n\nOne day, the Silver Equus just...well, vanished. The secret radio signal that lured guests to its doors went dead years ago, although rumors persist of a final bizarre broadcast  declaring something called ""an emergency alert"" before going to static. As time went on, and technology persisted, and bigger and better things came, the Silver Equus eventually faded away into legend.\n\nOur story begins over 20 years later, in 1996. \n\nYou, a man named Albert, awakens from a hazy coma, finding himself within an unfamiliar bed, in an unfamiliar place. All he knows is that he was looking for something, and a loud noise before everything went dark.  As you, Albert, investigate your surroundings, you are notified by a mysterious speaker, who promises to help you escape wherever you are. After a bit of tutorial, Albert finds himself a guest in the long, long forgotten Silver Equus Hotel under mysterious circumstances. To escape, Albert must contend with the other residents of the underground resort- bizarre, warped, ghost-like horrors that haunt the forgotten halls, ranging from a plaster-cased artist seeking a new, fleshy canvas, to a  mechanic whose body quite literally grows along the rusting, steaming machinery that runs behind the walls of the hotel. Albert also gathers pieces of the hotel's past, its mysterious downfall, and the answer to several questions. What happened the night of June 8th, 1976? What exactly was Jericho's last request? What lies underneath the hotel? And who or what is your mysterious friend that aids you through the halls. \n\nThe Silver Equus: Check Into Luxury.\n\n.........................................................................................\n\nMechanics.\n\n.........................................................................................\n\nAs Albert journeys through the Silver Equus and its sprawling underground rooms and lobbies, he encounters the Forgotten, the remains of guests and live-in workers who have been twisted by the unknown event that ended the hotel's life. Ghostly, warped shells of their former selves, the Forgotten hunt and stalk the cold, beautiful halls of the resort. Their backstories can be pieced together through audio tapes, notes, and journals (see below). They are pretty tough cookies, able to wield crude, dangerous weapons, ranging from firearms, sculptures, and even in certain cases the vents and machinery around the hotel, spewing scalding steam from vents or mashing you to pieces with elevator cars. There are ways to kill them, don't worry. Albert can find, or in some cases, create weapons from the hunks of junk that lay around the hotel. Use Molotov from the Midnight Club bar's expansive liquor stock (tip: the older the vintage, the hotter it burns), find a pickaxe in a mining warehouse, or even come across the good ol' shotgun if you're smart enough. However, there are certain other ways you can ""put to rest"" the forgotten souls of the Equus- if you can find a way to bring their humanity back to them, maybe they'll go to sleep. This is a bit more time-consuming, but the rewards are, more or less, a bit more enticing- not that they are certain other exclusive rewards for being a bit of a violent nutcase, of course.\n\nEach area of the Silver Equus has its own flavor, its own risks, and its own surprises. Always be on your guard, always expect the unexpected. For example, the Silver Equus Spa is a 70's day spa built along an underground spring. The spa's clinics contains a helpful variety of health restorations and bonuses, such as taking some ""mineral-made medicine"" can provide a bonus to how fast you can swing a weapon and how fast you run. But, beware! The steam pipes that connected the saunas and bathes now leak a strange, toxic cloud from below in the mines, coating the once decadent spa in a misty haze of poison. Also, its a bit flammable, so just be a bit careful where you toss a Molotov or light a candle. You aren't immune to fire- neither is your enemy though.  There are a few safe spaces in the Hotel though, although as you progress deeper into the story, you'll have to find one certain spot that is safe no matter what.\n\nThroughout your story at the Silver Equus, Al uncovers bits and pieces of the hotel's past, documented via journal entries, audio tapes, and notes.  These key pieces can put together the story of the Equus's past, provide a bit of flavor as to some of the characters you'll fight, or give hints to special surprises to unlock, as shown below.\n\n..................................................\n\nAudio Tape: Charlie Hollins - Pipe Works Followup \n\n""Hey, Annie, you ever get any confirmation on them requests I sent?

ar4dc0,Card Game where the Player makes their own cards,"As said in the title, but here is some more detail.\n\nIn essence, it'd be like Magic The Gathering, Yu-Gi-Oh, Pokemon TCG, etc. The difference being that there would be few, if any, premade cards. All cards are designed by the player using points they earn by winning battles. The better they do, the more points they earn. The more points they earn, the better the cards or the more cards they can make. Better could include a lower cost, more damage, more targets, etc. Meanwhile, you could also put negatives onto the cards to reduce the cost, such as paying life or excluding certain targets or requiring the sacrifice of some other card type. Perhaps certain types of effects synergize with certain types of costs.\n\nAs for the plot, I have no clue. \n\nYou could make it a high-fantasy game where the player is a wizard in training and learning to influence the forces of magic, with points equaling their power over magic. Their enemies would be other magicians that are summoning their own spells. The different costs of cards could be the classic elements(Fire, Earth, Water, and Air. Perhaps Metal or Spirit?) , or perhaps different schools of magic (Illusion, Enchanting, Necromancy, etc.)\n\nOr, you could make it sci-fi, where the player owns a tech company and is attempting to take over the corporate world by making better devices. Their cards could be robots to attack with, or genetically altered subjects to have unique effects on the opponent, or some form of energy creator that creates energy for other types of cards.\n\nHeck, maybe even make a series out of the idea and have different settings. Idk.\n\nReally, however you want to do the plot is up to you. The platform would have to be digital, and I'd suggest some form of online if that's possible, but you could do an offline campaign based on it.\n\nAs for credit, I guess I'd like maybe some form of referencing to this post, but I don't mind either way.\n\nA general idea of how it'd look, but made in Microsoft Paint without any artistic talent: [so accurate you'd think it was a screenshot /s](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/538766429164666880/546157929838149633/unknown.png)"
ar0mta,An idea for a health point system,"I haven't thought this through very far, it's just an idea I had that I figured I'd share.\n\nWhat if health points were made up of ratios instead of a set number? I'll give 3/4 and 6/2 as examples. The first number would function more like armor, dictating how much damage an attack would need to do to affect your character. The second number would be how many attacks above that threshold your character could sustain. \n\nSo, for 3/4, anything below 3 damage essentially wouldn't connect, and that character could sustain 4 attacks of 3 or above before going down. For 6/2, anything below 6 wouldn't connect, but you could only take 2 hits of that magnitude.\n\nI can see this being applied in a D&amp;D-type scenario, although I'm sure there are some problems with it that I'm not seeing. Thoughts? "
ar0eyh,What are your video game ideas that are too lengthy for an elevator pitch?,"Here’s mine : When you lock-on to or enter any battle zone, you hear all of the mics of the players in that battle and those players can hear your mic. Outside of battle, you hear the mic of any player that you lock on to and that player can hear your mic. You hear the mic of everybody in your party at all times. You can mute the mic of everybody or anybody that you want at all times.\n\nTo hear people's mics outside of battle, you can either lock onto other players or expand an open mic zone. You can only create an open mic zone if you are not within an open mic zone. Open mic zones create an invisible barrier, that doesn't block anything, that allows other players to join open mic parties. All you have to do is press a button to join, then your mic and the mic of everyone in the open mic zone can be heard. Open mic parties are different from regular parties or guilds because once you exit the open mic zone, you are no longer part of the party. All mute options are always available when it comes to mics.\n\nThere is customization of height, kid/adult, fat/skinny, clothes, equipment, armor, appearance, weapons, abilities, moves, skills, magic, and summons. Character appearance customization is similar to the game God Eater 2 and the game Sword Art Online: Hollow Realization. You get to create up to 4 characters. You control one character and can have any of your other characters in your party. Their AI can be set in a way that is similar to the game Star Ocean: Till the End of Time. You can play the game being any of the characters that you created. You can switch between controlling any character in your party at any time. You can choose not to control any character during battle, just set your character to AI.\n\nTo progress in the story, you have to travel to certain locations where you can talk to a NPC character who lets you enter servers that warp you to whatever section of the story that you're up to. Each server holds a limited amount of players and each server holds players that are all the same levels within intervals of 10 (example: server 1 - levels 1-10, server 2 - levels 10-20). You can always enter servers of any level higher than your level, but you can't enter servers that are any levels lower than it indicates that aren't your level. Certain things can be acquired through completion of different parts of the story. There are plenty of side stuff, hidden stuff, and optional stuff both in the story and not part of the story. There are places that have gates and portals similar to the .hack: infection game that lets you choose servers to try dungeons, etc.\n\nTo battle/fight, you either attack someone/something or are attacked by someone/something. No character/player will gain exp unless that character/player lands at least one hit on the opponent. That hit must be a hit, even if the damage dealt is 0, and not damage done by status effects. When you're in a battle, the battle zone radius is automatically set according to the location of the first participants. Only the first battle participants can lock a battle zone and at any time that they want.\n\nLocked battle zones have an invisible barrier that keeps the battle participants inside, all else are blocked from entering. If the battle zone is unlocked, any other player/character can join the battle and gain exp. You can only gain exp if you're in the same battle zone as the enemy that you defeated when you defeat that enemy. Enemies have a set amount of exp that is given for defeating them. If an enemy is defeated by more than one participant, the exp gets split among those participants equally. If there are no players in a battle zone for over 2 minutes, it is no longer a battle zone. There are harsh environments that your character may not be able to withstand. The item ""magic battle zone lock"" creates a locked battle zone, with you inside it, that keeps out fire, water, and etc.\n\nA player can't attack another player that isn't an enemy unless that player achieves ""G"" status or challenges another player to a fight/battle. To challenge another player to a fight/battle, you must be close enough to the other player, lock-on to the other player, choose the option to challenge that player, and expand a battle zone where all the players within it have to choose the option to accept the challenge for the battle to begin. The battle music options for this battle can be voted/agreed upon or a participant's playlist is chosen at random. ""G"" status is achieved when your bar/meter fills from attacking and being attacked. This bar/meter is for specials and ""G"" status is a special that everyone is able to use. If you have ""G"" status, you're an ally to everyone in the battle zone until you attack another player.\n\n""Gs'"" can't lock any battle zone that they have attacked an ally in. ""Gs"" gain complete exp of anything that they defeat unless those ""Gs"" didn't attack any allies. ""G"" status lasts for 11 minutes. If a ""G"" is defeated, that ""G"" loses ""G"" status, is no longer an enemy, and can be revived by anyone. ""Gs"" can't steal/mug anything from other players unless they are a King/Queen, Boss, or elite character. They also can't steal/mug anything from other players unless they are doing an agreed/accepted player battle. If 4 or more ""Gs"" attack allies in a battle zone, that battle zone achieves ""Frenzy"" and is an all out free-for-all. A frenzy battle zone can't be locked by anyone except Kings/Queens, Bosses, and Elite characters/players.\n\nWhen a player dies, that player can choose to press nothing and wait to be revived by someone else or that player gets to choose options to return to the entrance of where that player died, choose between servers for to return to the open world, or choose to go to the equipment graveyard. If you die more than 10 times, the option to return to the entrance of where you died is no longer available. Your mic still works while you're dead. You gain no exp/items when you are dead.\n\nThe map has many continents. Every continent is made up of zones. Each zone has its own enemies and friendlies. Most of the time, all enemies and/or friendlies in each zone are around the same level in their zone. When all enemies in a zone are defeated or all of the accomplishments are completed for a zone, the last players left have to battle each other. Whoever conquered the zone has the title of ""Boss"" of that zone and that player gets to choose what enemies that that zone will now contain. That player chooses those enemies based only on all of the enemies that that player has ever defeated in the game, Bosses included (different color scheme for bosses), except players. That player also chooses the level of those enemies but only up to the level of the highest level enemy that that player has ever defeated. If a ""boss"" player's zone is conquered by another player, that ""boss"" player loses the title ""Boss"".\n\nThere is a King/Queen for every continent, either a player or an NPC. Every King/Queen gets to have 4 elite characters. If you defeat a King/Queen in battle, you get his/her crown and title. Kings/Queens can pick his/her elite characters from their list of friends or their created AI characters. For being King/Queen, you get the special item ""crown"" which boosts stats. You can keep the crown equipped even when you're not King/Queen but you can't wear it appearance-wise unless you're King/Queen. Elite characters are only elite for as long as the King/Queen, who made them elite, stays King/Queen. Kings/Queens can enter any battle zone anytime even if it is locked. Kings/Queens can attack any character, including other players, that they want at any time.\n\nIf the battle zone is locked when you get up to any boss/miniboss in the story, dungeon, temple, cave, castle, or etc, you can go up to something there and press a button to fight the battle in another server either alone or with other players to progress. You can't re-fight bosses/minibosses unless you re-enter the entrance. You can enter servers with parties. You can complete any part of the game solo or in a party. A party can consist of all the players along with all of their created AI characters. There are servers with lobbies for dungeons, temples, caves, castles, or etc that wait to be filled, to a limit, to start the dungeon, temple, cave, castle, or etc with the players that were in those lobbies.\n\nThere are summons that you gain from leveling up, summons that you get from achievements, and summons that you get from defeating enemies. You gain most of the big bosses that you face in the game as summons for defeating them. You are only allowed to have a limited number of summons. When you use a summon, you have the option of summoning one of its very powerful attacks, or summoning it as an AI party member. If you summon it as a party member, you can switch between controlling it or your characters. Summons only last 4 minutes. When your summon is done or dismissed, you have to wait 4 minutes before you can use a summon again.\n\nYou can get beasts and etc to ride to make your traveling much easier. You can get to ride them by taming them with items or fighting them. While riding beasts/summons, you can take a certain amount of damage before being knocked off or disoriented. Higher level speed races let you be attacked by non-racers. If you tame the same species enough times, you can get them as a pet or summon and you can summon them whenever you want. Some species have the ability to fly. There are also vehicles that you can use for easier travel.\n\nYou don't have to have a beast/summon to fly. There are items that you can get that gives your party the ability ""fly"". Using these items, you are given the ability ""fly"" for 10 minutes to fly or not as you please. There are ways to permanently get the ability ""fly"". Flying is like it is in the game Kingdom Hearts 2 except when you choose the option ""ascend"". When you choose ""ascend"", you have free-flying control for all heights and directions. There is a button that you can hold to automatically fly towards whatever you are locked-on to.\n\nThere are competitive flying races and other races that you can do to earn things. There are different forms that your character can turn into such as a beastly form. These forms are abilities that can be unequipped to give you other options such as double summon, etc. You can customize your character's race, color, appearance, and etc anytime that you want except within battle.\n\nThere is an ability called ""Unlimited Jump"" that is like the ability ""Double Flight"" in the game Kingdom Hearts: A Fragmentary Passage, except it's not limited to double. There is an ability called ""ground-lock"" that allows you to land and run around on the air as if there is an invisible ground in the air. It turns off every time that you get hit by anything. There is another ability called ""teleport"", that lets you teleport to a random spot next to anything that you are locked-on to. After every 4 times of usage of this ability, you have to wait 4 minutes until you can use it again.\n\nAll of a player's characters can level up to a maximum of level 370. There are optional ultimate bosses that are level 400. Some of these bosses always leaves the player a legendary thing when defeated. There's a large variety of legendary things including a crown. Any time that you want, you can level lock your character/s, this keeps them from gaining exp until you switch level lock to off.\n\nTournaments vary from player vs player, player vs computer, team vs team, and team vs computer. A player's status such as Boss, King, or Elite appears next to his/her name when you lock on to him/her. You can definitely see other players' health bars as long as they are allies. There are items, that you can buy or obtain, that can warp you to friends, etc. When you warp to a friend, you warp to that friend's location or to the entrance of wherever that friend is.\n\nThe equipment graveyard is where all the equipment that players sold, lost, or got rid of, are littered all over the place. There are no enemies except the players that can attack you. Also except if you go up to a weapon or piece of equipment and challenge it. You will then fight a ghost copy of the player that the weapon or piece of equipment once belonged to, including that player's level and things, exactly as that player was when that player lost or got rid of that weapon or piece of equipment. You earn that weapon or piece of equipment exactly as it was when it was lost, scrapped, or sold. Only the player who challenged the weapon or piece of equipment is the one that gets that that weapon or piece of equipment after defeating it.\n\nAll weapons and pieces of equipment have levels, stats, and optional qualities/effects. All weapons and pieces of equipment can be leveled up and altered via the equipment world like in the game Disgaea: Hour of Darkness. The color schemes of enemies and bosses are different there. You can reset a weapon back to level 1 if you want, the stats go down but the appearance, qualities, and effects stay the same.\n\nYou can constantly earn things or buy things for appearance. You can keep, toss, trade, or sell whatever you want except abilities, skills, summons, crowns, and trophies. You can give money to whoever you want. You can get, earn, or unlock optional appearance things such as pointy ears, tails, a variety of wings, wing color, accessories, glasses/shades, jewelry, markings, and tattoos. All appearance things are obtainable and equipable from as soon as you first play. The variety is not all readily available for sale but can be either earned, traded, or sold by any player. Most of it is for sale from the start with a lot of it being ridiculously expensive, but any player can give you free money or let you earn it. Nothing can be bought or obtained with real life money, strictly in-game money.\n\nThere are varieties of items, weapons, equipment, and cards with the same name. These varieties include differences in look/appearance, stats, abilities, effects, and attributes. You can steal only weapons and equipment from other players. You can only steal from other players if they are enemies. To steal, you have to be in a battle zone and use steal-type attacks, techniques, or skills. Against other players, your steal success chances vary between 5%, 10%, and 15%. Against non-players, your chances can be much higher.\n\nYou can collect cards and there is an ability to turn enemies into cards like in the game Final Fantasy VIII. You can play the card game against other players, trade cards, or get cards from enemies, treasures, prizes, etc. Cards can be converted into items. Strong and rare cards can be converted into the best and rarest items. You can challenge any player or NPC to a card game when not in battle. There are card tournaments held at different locations. You can hear and mute mics while playing cards. You can also skip straight into playing the card game through the title menu where you strictly play cards. All cards and items are shared between your characters in the actual game and in the title screen card game. There are different card game rules in different locations. If no rules are set, players can play with agreed-upon rules or the rules are chosen at random. Any player that becomes a ""Boss"" of a zone, gets to pick the card rules for that zone. Any player that becomes a ""King/Queen"", gets to pick the card rules of any card game that that ""King/Queen"" plays."

aqrw30,[Experienced] A CCG which simplified the resource system.,"This CCG follow the Shadowverse formula but change a some major part of it and also change the playstyle and deck building as well. Here is some major features of my design idea:\n\n**1) Major design change:**\n\n-Your life point will be your deck size instead of having 20 life point. If a follower with 5 attack deal 5 damage to the player that player must send 5 cards on top of their deck to the graveyard.\n\n-Instead of paying X mana you need to discard X cards on your hand instead.\n\n-Your maximum hand size is 7, that's mean you potentially have 6 mana at maximum. At the start of each of your turn you will draw cards until your hand reach maximum 7 cards. This solve the problem of low mana every turn.\n\n-If your hand size reached 6 and you draw a card it will automatically discard that new card. This prevent player from ramping by drawing more card.\n\n-The win condition is deck out. Running out of life means running out of cards. Mill represent both dealing damage and mill at the same time.\n\n-If you pay X life you mill X cards. If you deal X damage to your opponent they mill X cards.\n\n-If you heal X life you randomly select X cards from your graveyard and shuffle it into your deck.\n\n-Most of the time you are not allowed to touch your graveyard and there is no card that can abuse the graveyard except for 1 faction which is specialized in graveyard manipulation but it is a very limited access to the graveyard. The reason is that abusing the graveyard mill is a big problem from both Yugioh and Mtg, having a big graveyard means having a big secondary hand resource. I wanted to prevent it from happening.\n\n-Evolve system: I love the evolve system from Shadowverse which allow unpredictable move from the player and it also open a different kind of depth inside it.\n\n**2) Some major problems: **\n\nThis kind of design lead to many problematic results which are very unpredictable. I will show out any problem that I have imagined:\n\n-Ramp: There will be a faction specialized in ramping like Shadowverse Dragoncraft. Instead of increasing the empty orb now you increase the maximum hand size instead.\n\n-Card draw: This is a hard thing for me, due to that fact every cards you draw are either being used for mana or being cast. My idea is to follow the formula of pay X and draw (X - 1) to prevent it from ramping too much.\n\n-Multiple copies: Since you will be losing cards pretty often the amount of copies of each cards in your deck will be increased. 3 or 4 copies at maximum won't be enough, it should be 6-7 copies instead or even more.\n\n-Very fast paced turn: Due to the fact you are able to access to 6 cards every turn basically you can cast a 5 mana cards each turn and it can potentially make anything below 5 mana become underwhelming or useless. It also means you can cast 3 cards with 1 mana cost at the same turn as well. This is the hardest point for me as I don't know what should be the limitation of the hand size to prevent thing went too far.\n\n-Maximum deck size: As your life is your deck and you also draw cards with a massive rate your life is burning with a rapid pace. That's mean your deck size will be very large to avoid ending the duel too fast. From my initial idea the maximum deck size should be 80-100 cards.\n\n\n\n\n"

You could unlock different abilities in each of the four bending areas: Earth, Water, Fire, and Air. You could fly with your glider across any of the 3 nations, and all the way up to the Air Temples. This would not only attract fans from the series, but it is also pleasant to anyone in the gamer world, since the idea is so appealing. Just like ""God of War"". Not only did it attract people from the old games, but also people that just like beautiful story-driven games."
aqpti2,Photobomb the World - A VR game in which you photobomb NPCs who just wanted to capture a nice memory.,"Due to one of the dumbest wishes a genie has ever heard, you are now constantly teleported to anywhere someone is about to take a picture so you can photobomb them. When you arrive to whichever absurd random location the picture is taking place, you have only a few seconds to grab whatever props you want from the scene to pose before the picture is taken. You can interact with nearly everything and anything in the scene to get just the right photobomb.\n\nA wedding picture at a beach in Bali? A selfie at a rock concert? A crime scene capturing evidence? The last picture by a rover on Mars? Yes, all that! I made myself sad though.\n\nPictures are scored by composition, prop use and other obscure factors. You can also share your pictures for others to rank. But more importantly, people can insert themselves into your pictures to photobomb your photobomb. The seconds setting up for the photobomb are all captured for playback for anyone that wants to upload themselves into your photobomb scene."

A horiffic army.\n\nYou survive somehow and learn that soon this army's invasion will begin in earnest. \n\nThat was the tutorial mission, now the whole kingdom opens up and you can go do what you want. \n\nEXCEPT now the clock is ticking down. In one, in-game year the invasion begins.\n\nYou can either ignore it completely, survive on your own or pick up a few followers. Perhaps build a little fortification for yourself in the south to fend off the beasts for as long as possible when they arrive.\n\nOR! You can try to unite all the ""houses"" of the kingdom, strategise and build to defend the world from the onslaught. You can use diplomacy, trickery, brute force or whatever to bring a fractured world together to defend itself.\n\nIt could be really hard and you have to like, replay a bunch of times to win. Could be it's more about how long you can last when that year is up. \n\nFollowers can accompany you or you can send them off to certain locations to help defend it. So say you can only have two followers at a time. If you come across another one you like, you can send them to a base point to store them and assign them of leading that outpost/castle or whatever. \n\nI'd love to play a game like that. One where you have to prepare for the inevitable. Basically I want to be John Snow facing down he Knight King.\n\nPlease someone make it."

Then you have to divide the numbers. Some villagers go farming, some go building, and some will be used to make an army.\n\nIf you want to train units, you have to put your villagers in the barracks etc. - If you trained one you could keep them in the barracks so other units could train faster (they teach them).\n\nIf you lose one, you're left with 99 units and there's no single way to get it back.

aqhpd5,Double Soccer Ball,"Anyone in Orange County area want to try this?\n\nA one on one (head to head) game of control and accuracy in soccer. The game is played on a basketball court size playing field preferably on a smooth surface. The nets are small soccer nets, or hockey size nets. It’s a game of control and in general both soccer balls are expected to be controlled by 1 player.\n\nRules:\n\n1. 2 Balls must go in to score. How far apart in seconds depends on you and your level. Try 3 seconds and adjust it. If the second ball goes in too late, no goal. \n2. Free Start. All scores, out of bounds etc. result in a possession by one side with enough space to control the balls and get started. Both balls are given to one side. Defense cannot touch any ball until both balls have passed the half court mark. Once both are across, play starts.\n3. If both players control one ball for a certain amount of time. Try 10 seconds and adjust it. Play is stopped and 1 side is given control in their court. Sides switch back and forth if no one is at fault.\n4. If one ball goes out of bounds, both balls are considered to be out of bounds. If it is 1 sides fault. Example: Player kicks ball out intentionally when the other is on a breakaway move. Then the guilty party gives up possession of the ball up to and including a penalty shot if so warranted. Most of the time this will result in a free start or free kick depending on where the ball(s) were. If neither side is at fault, a free start is awarded to the next queued player.\n5. Score until a certain amount like basketball. Try up to 10.\n6. Fouls. Soccer rules but more harsh. In general players should not touch each other. Fouls result in a “free kick” or “free start”.\n7. Free Kick. If a player is fouled in the opposing players end a free kick may be rewarded. The opposing player must stand back 10 feet. Once one ball is touched the defensive player is free to do anything.\n8. Penalty shot. If so warranted a penalty shot may be awarded. (Still thinking this one out as the nets are too small for a soccer style penalty shot)\n\nStrategy Moves / Learning the game / Examples.\n\n1. Since the opposing side cannot touch a single ball across the half line a play would be to kick the first ball in a corner ever so slowly, maybe with enough spin to come to be centered. The player then controls the 2nd ball, dekes the opponent and meets up with the other ball using each leg to kick in one ball.\n2. Long distance kick into the goal followed by another quick kick. Perhaps the 1st one over the opponents head. Example: First ball lifted over opponents head bouncing towards net, quick deke to one side and boom the 2nd ball in. 1st ball bounces in behind.\n3. Both balls together. Good players will learn to control both balls so well that almost any soccer move can be made.\n4. Both players controlling one ball. If this happens a good player will protect his ball, or place it in a strategic position and then go after the other players ball eventually controlling both balls. May be difficult to accomplish this in practice.\n5. Defensive moves. Get to one ball. Simple. The other player cannot score with one ball.\n\nGood Player Qualities\n\n1. Does not need to follow the ball with eyes to know where it’s going. One glance at the trajectory and spin of the ball and he knows where the ball will be. Similarly if the ball leaves the players feet, he knows where it will be. No need to look at the ball.\n2. Can kick with both legs at near the same time.\n3. Can control each ball with one leg at the same time.\n4. Fast, Coordinated etc.\n5. Can control both balls like they were one ball."

The enemy army is chasing all the routed soldiers down and you have no other choice than to fight. You and the remaining soldiers try to raise another small army consisting of the routed soldiers. You won't be able to fight the enemy army head on on the open field, so you use guerilla tactics as raiding villages etc. for survival, ambushing enemy camps, convoys, supplies and moving forces. I can imagine this game being a strategy game like Total War or a game like Kingdom Come/Mount and Blade, both would work. Of course that's not the whole story line and you won't be just fighting that army, but the whole war."

After searching for new jobs and places he eventually came across a magic wine that belonged to an ancient Roman god. After he drank it gave him super powers of a god and he suddenly envisioned of a master to go find and he did which he learned the drunken kung fu fist arts. The other idea would be I make an ancient Roman god that joined a special cult where drinking wine that gives you ultimate power and he drank it giving him divine powers but he envisioned these 8 Immortal Chinese gods which led him to learn the drunken fist from them?

aq6n51,Minimalist turn-based combat?,"I am designing a game with turn-based combat for myself, to play on mobile while commuting. This means it should have a very minimal UI, to easily fit into the small mobile format.\n\nSo, the requirements are:\n\n- A few buttons at most to perform actions.\n- Not too many resources to control during the fight.\n- Probably no positioning (maybe a small 3x3 grid could work on mobile, but I'm not sure).\n- Only controlling 1 character. It just personally feels better to me than controlling a squad.\n\nWith this in mind, I'm trying to come up with a good core mechanics for combat, but without much success. Here are several ideas I had:\n\n- Classics Rock-Paper-Scissors where you reduce the enemy's health for each successful hit. All enemies have patterns which can be figured out. This turned out better than I expected, but as you learn the enemy archetypes, it gets too easy (you can guess their behavior from first 2-3 turns) or too random (if they have very long patterns).\n- The player and the opponent allocate some stamina to perform an attack. The attack with more stamina deals damage, and the stamina regenerates each turn. This gets boring when both combatants are out of stamina and just do 1-stamina-attacks or skip turns. I also don't know how to expand on this to make it interesting.\n- Deck-building and cards. I like games like Slay the Spire, so this could certainly work. However, designing a large balanced set of cards seems more time-consuming than any other option. I am also not comfortable with having more than 3-5 options to choose from on a small mobile screen. So, I don't consider this option seriously, at least in its usual form.\n\nI think I need several dimensions of complexity to make it interesting, e.g. more than one resource (health), choosing more than 1 option each turn (e.g. an attack + some modifier), etc. However, I cannot come up with anything specific.\n\nCan you give some suggestions regarding what core concept I can use to make a reasonably fun combat against AI?\n\nAny ideas are appreciated!"
aq6hhb,MMORPG Maker for everyone in a browser,"I am trying to create really simple to use MMORPG maker. Created games would have feeling of mixed ultima online and final fantasy tactics. Users would create their own worlds with custom map, npcs, monsters, skills, items etc. Everything with simple to understand UI (no coding). Whole thing would be made in a browser (no need to download anything), you just log in, create world, setup your things and run. Would you like to use such maker? Would you pay for it, in example for version that supports more than 5 users simultanously? There is a lot of work to do, so I first want to know if there is enough interest in such thing."
aq4psh,Completely open ended thrilling sandbox Mystery Detective game... (does this exist?),"Deadly Premonition, Indigo Prophecy, LA Noire and maybe The Call of Cthulhu. Have all left me with a serious desire for a modern day fully developed game where you actually get to play as a detective and solve crimes. Not a first person shooter or sandbox linear storyline either. I mean a completely open ended story in a large city where you have a main story that consist of following in the footsteps of a serial killer to find out who he is using realistic investigation methods. Dialog options, well written characters, multiple endings, twist and turns in the story. Sure there are games that have touched on that idea like LA Noire or Deadly Premonition but their story gets linear in that the killer becomes obvious through scripted events.  \n\n\nYou'd have your main mission which would be following the trail of bloody crime scenes left by a serial killer. As with any crime investigation you start off with hundreds and hundreds of suspects that you must narrow down. You must comb through each crime scene (not have them all blinking or with highlighted icons all over them). Gather DNA, ask witnesses, search up people's backgrounds and piece everything together. You have side missions as well which revolve around solving other crimes to pass by time while forensics do some DNA work or while officers gather up intel for you. These side missions can be anything from murder, robbery or tracking down people who have warrants.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe main missions would be selected by the player. You can pick from a wide selection of suspects to focus on. Have the mission select be a pin up board with pictures of the suspects you've narrowed down later in the game and choose to either follow them around. Take them in for questioning. Tail their cars and see what they do all day. Find out their alibi and test it to see if it's true. The player finds out more through each crime scene as days go on. They must gather enough evidence to take in a suspect, get a search warrant or enough to fully charge them where a court case would take place towards the end of the game where your hard work will pay off. Bad choices, missing evidence and not using your wits would mean the suspect goes free so it's a fully immersive experience that is very true to life.\n\nBefore Telltale's The Walking Dead I wouldn't think this game would exist because people would be asking ""where's the gameplay"" but I think gamers are looking for more interactive, intelligent immersive games now more than ever. I think something like this would be very fun.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOr I'm completely ignoring the indie scene and maybe there's a game like this out somewhere?"

atxa1z,A game mode that could become better then BattleRoyal,"  \n\nThe easiest way I could describe it is having 4 sectors (or more) in one big map. Players start in one and are moved to other tiers by the same principle applied in battle royal game, may it be storms, gas or whatever, that location contains better loot. The major difference begins here.\n\nAfter the players are moved others spawn and loot is regenerated, exiting there playable space is permitted but has health damage (lower for spawning players higher for higher tier players) This gives the possibility of gaining great loot at the beginning of a game but it is a high risk high reward situation. Multiple goals could be achieved in this arena\n\n\* Survival: which could go on for as long as a player wants gaining kill after kill each time facing new enemies. Records could be held for time and number of kills.\n\n\* Kill limit: no different then a Free for all get 30 kills and you win\n\n\* Zone control: last survivor in your spawn wave.\n\nThese scenarios can all be part of the same game play, as long as the ending is brief.\n\nThis could be implemented in any shooter or even RPG battles.\n\nWhy would you want to play this? \n\n\* I’ve always had awful accuracy winning doesn't come easy; having multiple ways to win is a good thing. Having to deal with 30 players instead of 100 at a time. \n\n\* Streamers win often and they seem to have it easy for most of the time, having a harder difficulty might challenge them.\n\n\* Fast paced game play that will at least moderate camping since you can't go to the end zone at the beginning. \n\n\* Eventually people will look for something new as they did when the first battle royal game appeared."

atunq9,Cashier Tycoon,"Hello guys, just want to chip in this idea of mine of a cashier-type tycoon game..\n\nI think working as a cashier/bank teller/front desk staff is a hard job to do since you don't know what kind of customers you meet in a daily basis. Thus, would kind of translate greatly to a game.\n\n**For a cashier game:**\n\n\- great money management (changes are a lot of hard to come by and sometimes you ask some change from your customer or else you have to check with other cashiers if they have some change for a dollar or more)\n\n\- doing simple math, consistently. (giving out the exact change or counting the money the customer gave you)\n\n\- doing your job fast while being efficient (scanning products, preparing the change, or packing the products, gotta look out for impatient customers though!)\n\n**bank teller:**\n\n\- opening new bank accounts (registering customers, inputting the details that were given to you on the bank's system)\n\n\- withdrawals and deposits (enter the correct amount, and look out for instances where their current balance or simply account details doesn't match)\n\n**front desk staff:**\n\n\-pretty broad concept but could be in a hotel, a police station, or a corporate setting.\n\n\-basically this focuses more on managing the company's resources (available rooms/services, available officers that can assist or proper departments or floors the guest should go to)\n\nI think that's all lol!

atu0xk,FPS/RTS/Management/Survival/Godgame? Hybrid game,"The things I love the most in games are seeing the world progress around your character and/or your actions speeding up or changing the progress of a world.\n\nI have two ideas for the start of the game:\n\nEither you are a lonesome god that wants more worshippers and you wish to build an empire to worship you, or:\n\nYou start off as a lone person in your typical survival setting, its just you and your stick/rock/heirloom sword etc against the world and you set out to make a living for yourself. You can eventually build yourself quite a good looking base, and have a comfortable life for yourself....\n\nhowever by that point you realise it is quite lonely being a single wanderer living in the wilderness.\n\nYou now want more people around, and you do your best to create things that would attract them such as building houses, making a surplus of food, making the area safer from monsters, (Think of something like Colony Survival, where you start as a lone person and eventually build a thriving town/city for all your people and protect them from monsters) and eventually start to get more and more people.\n\nThe game could have some rough guidance to make you want to build a city, maybe you were the last son of a royal bloodline that had their land stolen and their lives taken and now you want your glory days back and the might of your kingdom restored, or maybe you just want to build a safe place for wanderers like yourself and create a charming rest stop for travellers in a small hamlet.\n\nYou could make your city a huge sprawling metropolis, create a tiny secluded village hidden from the world, or maybe an extremely advanced society in an exclusive small city\n\nDREAM IDEAS THAT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO IMPLEMENT:\n\nIf the game went along the godgame path then a persistent family system for your people as the time passes that shows family connections in your city, (Think like Banished with people marrying and having children and increasing population)\n\nMultiplayer, either a few people building one empire/city/village or a few people competing in a brief almost skirmish format of the game.\n\nRimworld level unique citizens (Now thats a pipe dream within a pipe dream for a city builder)"
att1qj,Murder Mystery Party,"Can't believe this genre has not been revisited for many years so I'll give my own take on a current gen third person murder mystery party for up to 12 players.\n\nThink everyone gets the rules by now. Basically one person is the murderer while two secret detectives are in the mix holding weapons who are able to shoot anyone suspicyat any time. If they shoot an innocent then they are eliminated from that round to prevent people from screwing around with the role. There could be one off special add on roles that let you play as things like security guard where you can set up a limited amount of cameras around the map to spot any suspicious activity, an imposter who is the murderers friend and can act as the murderer and possibly get one kill per round. The murderer can also disguise as different roles to hide their identity.\n\nList of maps:\n\nLuxurious Mansion\n\nIsland\n\nSummer Camp\n\nSuburban Neighbourhood\n\nTrain\n\n\n\n\n"

You are on a journey to find the best warriors to find a cure and fight through the opposing abyss creatures that plague the land ( journey into the abyss )\n\nIf you accept the investigation, you are granted the Kings top men and sent with a small troop of warriors.  The call of the void affects you and them making you prone to attacking them randomly and them also attacking you or eachother ( if they die you do not get them back and they will fall into the abyss and turn into mindless monsters ) you find special weapons names in a different language but you notice it increases your damage almost double but you take double damage and also your call of the void increases. You are cursed with the void. You travel down to investigate more as you fight monsters and travel it’s lands , you kill the oldest being of the void he whispers “ the void lives inside us all” you thinking it means nothing you find that you cannot leave the abyss without becoming blood thirsty and kill anything insight.

You just decided to attack it. The guards that you were doing quests for? You attacked them. There would be two types of weapons which would be normal and then buffed alterations you could find named void weapons , these weapons deal greater damage but increase your calling. Even the final boss would be a void creature and as it lay dying it just says “ you are the voids minion now” only to find you cannot go back to the open world because you attack anything and everything but luckily for you the void also has a town inside and now you’re fighting to cleanse yourself of the curse."

atasxx,My R-rated game idea,"So a game like this would probably cause some controversy these days but I'll throw it out there anyway.\n\nTitle: Psychopath\n\nDescription: You are Mr. Perfect, you have just turned 30 and married to the love of your life. You live in the perfect house located in a picture perfect neighbourhood surrounded by great company. What more could you ask for? Mass genocide!\n\nSo basically you play as Mr Perfect as he goes about his everyday life in an open world that allows free exploration over 3 massive locations (which can be expanded on with DLC) which consist of a sprawling city, quiet neighbourhood and farmlands. Mr Perfect is an absolute psychopath on the inside which he has kept hidden his whole life but he has now reached a point where he cannot contain his innermost desire of murder any longer and wants to go on a rampage, the thing is he is smarter then that and knows how to stay out of trouble.\n\nThe game would take place over a day/night cycle with a meter that shows Mr Perfects sanity level. When sane Perfect is cunning and is able to lure his target/s into his trap but when on the verge of insanity he is extremely dangerous and can't control his actions. At the start of the game you would only need one kill per day to stay sane while the amount of kills increase per day, it basically follows the survival formula of how many days you can go without being caught and this is where the tricky part comes in, the city in which Mr Perfect lives is regarded as one of the safest and friendliest cities in the world with cops patrolling the city each day to make sure it stays this way and extremely nosy civilians that know everyone and everything about each other's lives so a simple blood stain on the jacket out in public can quickly escalate into a massive investigation with cops and detectives possibly keeping an eye on you and searching your house.\n\nPreviously I stated that the game would be divided into 3 landscapes which are the city, neighbourhood and farmlands which all hold different gameplay aspects. The city is where the luring takes place, this is where Perfect meets his victims and takes them back to his house which is located in the neighbourhood for the perfect execution. Now while Perfect can kill in the city or wherever he likes, his preferred location is his own house as it is the safest route and has all his cleaning and disposal tools at his use. The farmlands are basically the location where Perfect dumps and hides all the bodies but he still has to be careful since there are tons of wildlife that could alert nearby farmers to something suspicious in the woods aka a body.\n\nSo yeah, I could probably go on a lot longer about other little details I've thought up like \n\n"

at1c7b,Naruto hand sign based game,"Alright, I've had this idea for a while, and at the start it sounded good but once I thought about it a bit more I saw some problems with it, which I'll explain at the end.\n\n# Concept\n\nThe game is centered around the player being a newbie ninja who fights other ninjas in a card based fashion, but the cards are 12 and each one corresponds to a hand sign used for forming a jutsu.\n\n# Fighting\n\nThe fighting is turn based between you and an enemy. Each turn you need to play 3 of the 12 hand signs in different variation with no repetition of hand signs (you'll find out why later). Matching different hand signs produces different jutsu. Some jutsu damage the opponent, some boost you, some raise your defence/evade attacks and so on. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo basically the idea is matching different hand signs for the player to explore different possibilities with the hand sign permutations. The problem is permutations with 12 hand signs and 3 hand sign slots produces 1320 possible permutations and that is way too many jutsu/abilities to create and no player will be willing to test them all, they'll be annoyed. Even lowering it to 12 hand signs and 2 slots will produce 132 possible permutations which is still quite a lot, plus I find it a bit lackluster to make jutsus with only 2 hand signs, but it seems there is no other choice. I even thought about lowering the hand signs to 8 with 2 hand sign slots which is 56 permutations and is much more manageable. Of course that is just the main concept, you might add that a player can only have 4-5 different hand signs in his hand at all times or add a chakra bar which controls what jutsu you can use or how powerful it is. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother fix for the permutation problem is to make them combinations, 12 hand signs with 2 slots produce 66 combinations so that is way more manageable. So yeah, that's my idea, I hope it's not too confusing as it is my first post here and actually my first reddit post, so if anyone doesn't understand something just ask and I'll clarify. "

Have different skill trees for all of the elements + melee combat with the staff and hand to hand.\n\nI had this thought last night and thought it would be doable seeing as there’s an ATLA Netflix series on the way.
asquzz,Assymetric Fight game,"Let me try to explain my idea.\n\n\n* Arena game, with MMR based match making.\n\n\n* 2v1 fights. The system will try to match 1 strong players with 2 much weaker players. ""strong"" includes both more skilled people and stronger builds.\n\n\n* Everytime you win a fight, you gain gold which you can spend on improving your character. A lot of different things could be improved. Weapons, helmets, shields, vitality, strength, etc. At any times, players can reset their gear and try totally different builds. Many different weapons available.\n\n\n* Fight system similar to chivalry. Medieval setting. Sword fights, etc. Fight probably happen in a gladiator arena. Think of Spartacus + Crixus vs Theokoles.\n\n\n* Even thought there is no real limit to improving your character, there is serious diminishing returns over time. For example, initial gold could be 100 gold, and a win gives 10 gold. So initially, a win means a 10% improvement. But once your warrior is worth 1000 gold, a 10 gold win has much smaller effects.\n\n\n* Possibility of choosing a preference (Being alone vs 2, or in team with someone vs 1). But no guarentee. For example, if a top players tries to queue for 2v1, it might force said player to do 1v2 instead.\n\n\n* Possibility of talking on mic with your partner."

asmwas,Handgun/Pistol only game.,This game would include guns from different eras and wars. From machine pistols to sling-shots every gun would have deep customization as to putting scopes and lasers on a luger pistol. Not sure about camo or paint jobs yet. \n\nThe gameplay would be basically battlefield 3 with all the improvements from the newest games. You could theoretically have a M93 Raffica vs a C-93
asmuox,Cursed possession.,"So, your a spirit that has the power to possess someone, anyone, you can do as you wish, but, you have to live their whole life for them or commit suicide. *But*  you cant just stand in front of a car and boom. It has to be for a valid reason like, for example, your an alcoholic that likes to play Russian roulette, valid reason for suicide, someone going through severe depression, valid reason for suicide. You have the choice to make it start in a city, small town, or basically a metropolis. Before possessing someone you get to see some info about them, quirks, height, weight, ect. There's also a skill tree that can unlock stuff like courage, unlocks mugging and robbery, poor mental health, unlocks depression or some other mental disease, extremely poor mental health, unlocks insanity or some other severe mental disease. To get a skill point you kill someone."
asl853,Battlefield Style Grand Scale PVE,"Think Battlefield's conquest mode with combined arms combat as a basic structure.  64 players on a team but there is no other team.  Instead it's 64 players trying to take a large map within an objective time and with limited ""tickets"".\n\nObjective capture points will often require that the team will have to divide and conquer.  Often certain points can't be captured alone and will require another segment of the team to hold another location of the map.  All throughout, enemies will frequently spawn in hordes and assault the playerbase (not unlike L4D's AI director).\n\nSome capture points require a boss character to be defeated.  Some bosses can't be defeated while other territories aren't held which will constant be assaulted by spawning enemies. Holding territories will of course mean more spawn point options, vehicles, and other tactical resources.\n\nOnce the timer is up, a ""grand"" boss not unlike kaiju scale will arrive still supported by legions of enemies. \n It will be inevitable that his arrival will mean the players will start losing territory again.  Players will have to use what they have acquired through the initial conquest to take it down.  If it reaches the player's initial (main) spawn base, then the players lose."
asisq7,Web War (a crossover fighting game between web series),"RWBY. Terrain Of Magical Expertise. SMG4. Web series such as these are immensely popular and have earned many fans. Bloody Bunny. The Chosen. The Adventures of Dumplin. Web series such as these are lesser known, yet still enticing. Whether you like them, hate them, or have never cared for them, there's no denying that it would be someone's dream to see some of their favorite characters from across the internet decide who would reign supreme on the field of battle. In Web War, however, that dream shall become reality! Featuring characters from the franchises mentioned above and possibly more, this is a crossover fighting game that includes those from various internet shows coming together for a special tournament referred to as ""The Brawl Between Worlds"". Only the most skilled at combat will win the title of ""Warrior of the Web"" and prove their might to all who watch. Gameplay-wise, it plays somewhat like various other fighting games. Similar to the Guilty Gear series, each character possesses a Super Meter that can build up a maximum of three levels, the first and second unleashing powerful Super Attacks, and the third unleashing a climactic ""Destroy"" attack, which is a guaranteed victory if it lands. Similar to the Mortal Kombat series, certain characters will have special interactions when they begin fighting against one another. Also, how much you play a character determines how much said character grows. As you play as someone in particular more and more, they will gain Experience Points that will cause them to level up after a certain number of battles. Each time someone levels up, you can choose to boost a specific attribute of that someone slightly, such as Health, Offense, Speed, or how quickly they build up their Super Meter. Keep in mind, however, that each stat you choose to boost is a final decision, and will stick with them each time you enter competitive play. With all that being said, sharpen your blades, ready your fists, power yourself up, and have fun! Are you ready? To War!"
asfmzf,DnD based platform fighter,"It combines my 2 favorite things dungeons and dragons, and platform fighters (i.e. super smash) i mean i have to much free time and have 16 character ideas (race/class) and 3 of them have moves ideas wrote out.\n\nAlso added a gimmick for each character rather it be how rage works or sneak attack or metamagic."
asf55c,VR city simulator with chat bots,"The primary concept here is to make a game heavily featuring voice-synthesized AI chat bot tech.  It's essentially a tech demo.\n\nThe key selling point:  immersive language learning.  Players could walk around a ""real"" city (see later notes) populated by everyday objects and human characters you can converse with about everyday activities like buying vegetables or going to see a movie.  If you're not sure what an object is called, you can toggle a hotkey to show the word for whatever is in the center of your field of view.\n\nBetter still:  automated localization.  Again, essentially a tech demo, but imagine all in-game text and spoken dialogue being auto-translated into the language of your choice.  In-game art and voice acting may not be as high quality, but it would be a huge cost savings and great for language learning applications.  (You won't learn to speak and read like a native, but you'd get a *lot* more exposure than with scripted voice acting.)\n\nTo keep costs and processing/storage resources low, you'd probably want to build a generic city that could be in any country--maybe the traffic signs, types of restaurants, fashion, etc., wouldn't be at all accurate, but it would be a kind of familiar any-city where everyone speaks the language you choose.  Maybe it's like a weird hodgepodge of different cultures, or a fictionalized average.  Maybe offer expansions or DLC that make the game more closely resemble specific countries or even actual cities.\n\nNow, something like an AR/VR version of the AI companion in *Bladerunner 2049* is going to happen for real soon, and there are going to be versions of it that speak different languages.  It's only a matter of time before the AR/VR chat bot speaks any/all languages and developers start populating worlds with them (or retail shops for that matter).\n\n[https://venturebeat.com/2018/10/10/magic-leaps-mica-is-a-human-like-ai-in-augmented-reality/](https://venturebeat.com/2018/10/10/magic-leaps-mica-is-a-human-like-ai-in-augmented-reality/)\n\nI'm just thinking it would be great to do that now, using current voice synth, chat bot, and translation tech.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics and story could be anything.  I'd want it to be non-violent to keep the focus on immersive language learning for all ages, but basically anything could work.  It could *just* be a walking simulator where you go around the VR city and shop and chat with people.  Or it could be some kind of deep sci-fi mystery about living inside a simulation.  It's important to me, though, that both difficulty and story be optional."
asen0k,Firewatch like game based on industrial espionage,"So this is a game i've thought about latelty since i started working at a large tech company. I imagine the length of the game, and gameplay style like firewatch. However, I imagine the color theme and soundtrack much greyer, than firewatch.  \n\n\nHere goes: \n\n**Game type:** First person, story driven, walking simulator  \n\n\n**Plot:** You are a mechanical engineer, in your late 20's, due to events in your past you've been forced into conducting industrial espionage at a large tech company, that recently hired you to work at an insignificant department. The competing company that hired you will be your guide into what you should do.  \nAs the game progresses you will transfer to more restricted departments.  \n**Game setting:** The game should be entirely set in a large but stylish office building, perhaps with an adjoining workshop.  \n\n\n**What makes the game fun?:**  \n I would describe the style as *Sneaking around in plain sight.* Where you try to avoid getting caught, and avoid trying to look to suspicious.\n\n\- *Early game*: Stealing classified documents from colleagues, listening in on conversations in hallways, luring passwords, piggybacking into restricted departments, tricking people to leave their desks, bugging conference rooms etc.  \n\- *Mid-late game:* The nature of the stuff you have to do turns more malicious such as destroying, prototypes, framing coworkers for your deeds, and causing ""accidents"" with fatalities to key employees, perhaps even causing fires. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Additional ideas:**  \n\- There could be a ""meter"" that tracks under how much suspicion you are under.  \n\- There could be a love interest in a coworker to drive the story and create a conflict in what you are doing.  \n\- As the game progresses and suspicion increases, the company could hire guards to track you  \n\- As the company crumbles people could be layed off, and less people are visible in the hallways giving an almost ghost town like feeling.  \n\n\nPlease let me know your thoughts! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \n"
ase1ek,Auction based competitive game,"The game would be 1v1. Purely strategical game, auction based.\n\n\n\n**Core concept**\n\n\nThe core idea would be that each players starts the game with 1000$. There would be something like 10 different ""cards"" you fight for. Each cards are randomly generated, with very varied effects. All cards are face up, all information is known. The game gives both players 30-60 seconds to study the board and see which cards are better before the game starts. The game then selects a card at random, and both players have to choose how much they are willing to pay for the card. Whoever has choosen the highest amount, pays exactly that amount for his card. Then another card is chosen.\n\n\nExample: The game choose ""Axeman"", with 24 life and 2 damage. Player A secretly wants to pay 80$ for it, Player B choose 85$. Player B buys the card for 85$.\n\n\n**Game itself**\n\n\nWhat actually happens once both players have bought all of their card, would probably be some sort of automated fight. For example, the ""cards"" could all represent warriors, and then the fight actually happens once the buy phase is over.\n\n\nThis part probably requires more thought, but isn't as important since its not the core gameplay.\n\n\n\nNote: I myself am a programmer, so if people think its a good idea, i could potentially try to do it, or assist someone with it. If people think its a bad idea, then i won't waste time lol"
asbakv,Zombie rts not they are billions,"This is a game I've been wanting a long time and I see alot of posts *similiar* to what I'm talking about  but dont quite hit the mark. Also I've played they are billions it isnt close enough to what I'm hoping for. \n\nTags: rts, zombie, base building, resource and item management, single player, multiplayer, birds eye view\n\nGeneral idea: you start with one survivor spawning in a random part of the map having after a majority of the world has been taken over by zombies \nNot fantasy. Just modern day.\nThe map: the map could be the entirety of America ( I know very ambitious) could be like one state that includes cities, towns and farm lands \n\n\nCore game play and mechanics:\nWhat would drive exploration? If you want to farm for food for your survivors you would have a hard time doing so in the city and eventually would scavenge everything in the city so you need to arm a few survivors to head over to the farm and secure it and setup walls defences and send more survivors over to start farming. \n \nPart of the game is surviving and to do that you need weapons! Whether by scavenging for them or eventually producing them once your production capability can do that \n\nZombies: instead of like they are billions that comes in waves in this world the zombie ai works based off of sound so if they hear one of your factories, gun shots or any of the variety of things that would make a loud noise. \n(I dont know if this is possible) but making it so only a certain amount of zombies are seeking out survivor alongside the noise mechanic like 5 or 10 percent of the zombies are actively seeking out survivors at a time on the map \n\nVehicles:a variety of vehicles in the game you can assign survivors to drive and assign multiple survivors to one vehicle and send them somewhere. \nCivilian vehicles and military trucks keeps and armored cars and tanks \n\nIf you want to guard a wall you have to actually have survivors there you cant just click ""assign"" you need to have them standing near the wall, setup a patrol path or put them in a watch tower to have better range\n\n\n\nBase building: there are a variety of things that. An be built and it can either be assigned to your character or any of the other survivors you have recruited \n\nSome of the buildings you can make is survivor homes. \n\ncrafters for making health items or melee weapons.\nHeavy crafting building available only with a large amount of resources.\n\nHeavy crafters could make guns and ammunition and possibly others if I think of any.\n\nYou can build watch towers and make survivors to go in them with guns to watch for zombies.\n\nBarbwire to help slow zombies.\n\nMetal fencing and barbwire to stop zombies in their tracks but if you allow to many zombies to press up against it it will topple over from the weight.\n\nResearch station research a vaccine for zombieism. \n\nTrenches and a variety of other defences.\n\nMines and farms to collect resources and survivors have to be assigned to mine these resources. \n\nRepair stations for vehicles.\n\n"
as6m08,A JRPG in English that slowly turns the text to Japanese to help you learn.,"Just so that the language learned isn't all fantasy/anime trope stuff, the story should probably begin in the real world and introduce a conflict which brings in the capacity for sci-fi or fantasy terms as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne of the core mechanics of the game would be that all kinds of items (nouns), quests (verbs), and statuses/spells (adjectives, adverbs) would, when successfully collected, completed, answered, etc. gain you progress in the story of bringing balance back into the world. Even mundane things like coffee pots or entrance exams need to be dealt with because all aspects of humanity are under attack. Anything could house a secret power or equipment status (or hide an enemy! Mimics everywhere!). Grammar is gained throughout the arcs when reflecting upon all your exploits . Etc. Etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe point being that the more you can learn to interact with in the language, the better you can do. There would need to be some non-linear design just because players may learn words in different orders than others. When you opt into some content in the game like a quest, a certain batch of words will be turned to Japanese terms. Some of the most powerful tools to collect are the characters of the writing system, the kana and the kanji. You as the player don't have to do perfectly well, and actually, the game can be completed mostly in English if changing too much stuff to Japanese proves hard. But THEN, every time you select New Game +, your prior knowledge comes with you and you can see the earlier scenes in the game in more and more Japanese form.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSpoken voices would likely be 100% Japanese for constant help. Subtitles, menus, text boxes would be the things that change over time, although a hard-core Japanese-only text and voice mode would always be available on demand.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe problem is that changing words gradually hits a brick wall when grammar and phrasing is so, so different between the two languages. There is only so much that you can do substituting word for word. Like ""I'm hungry"" becomes literally ""stomach emptied"" in Japanese. So there would need to be honest to goodness full steps when changing the script at many points. That said, as long as the game was fundamentally interesting enough and mechanically fun to play with a deep battle system, interesting characters, and puzzles that got MORE interesting the more language knowledge you can put into them, hopefully players would be willing to play through the game repeatedly without dying of rerun boredom.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI mean, I'd play it."
as6jg3,RPG with more realistic economics/finance,"So the RPG starts off like any RPG: You have a character living on his little farm, with nothing more than his or her dusty tunic, rusty butter knife, and pot lid shield. Except if you try to go out into the wilderness to smack around slimes, they'll kill you. Because those aren't real weapons or armor. And even if you did, they wouldn't drop any coins or equipment. Because they're slimes.\n\nInstead, you have to get your weapons and armor like you would in the real world, you go to a shop and buy them. Except, being a dirt poor farmer, you don't have enough coins. So, much as any enterprising entrepreneur would do, you have to go to your local lending establishment, and take out a loan. Initially you wouldn't be able to take out much, as the little farm is not a lot of collateral. However, even early on, and as the game progresses, you have to balance the amount of coin you want right now, with your ability to pay back your principle plus interest. And if you default? Well, being a typical RPG world, the lenders' methods of repo are, medieval.\n\nBalancing this out would be a system of reputation, wherein you have to weight your ability to pay back you loan, with your reputation. You could, say, defeat the monster that's been terrorizing a small village. You'd get a pittance from them, and the monster's assorted bits wouldn't fetch much, but your reputation will be boosted significantly. Alternatively, you could just ride into a small, defenseless village with your shiny armor and shake them down for their merger savings. You'll pay off that loan quicker, but but your reputation will sour and, again being a medieval world, riches can't overcome a truly rotten reputation, and the king may decide to take you out as a menace to society.\n\nSpeaking of such things, you can take jobs from the king, but that too comes with risks. If the king sparks a revolt from the peasants or the other lords, you'll get sent to the guillotine along with him. Or, if those jobs involve actions against neighboring kingdoms, they'll put a bounty on your head.\n\nGiven the nature of the setup, I would see this game not having a singular, narrative conclusion, no princess to rescue and then live happily ever after. Rather, more of a scenario/goal kind of setup a la SimCity or Civ, where you can determine a particular outcome you're striving for at the outset, and success is determined upon hitting that outcome.\n\nI would say this would be an experienced-level kind of project, as the programmers would need to be sharp in order to make all these systems play nice with each other, but not necessarily a AAA-level team as this could just as easily work within a 16-bit throwback style as it would a modern bleeding-edge graphic performance RPG."
as684s,A weed simulator,"I came up with this idea playing GTA 5. As a stoner, I really wish there was a realistic weed simulator. It could be really simple. A basic open world map with good views, and shops of course. It would be so fun playing a video game just exploring, leveling up, selling, and smoking weed. Sorry I’m really bad at wording it. Basically just put a lot of details into rolling up, buying weed, strains, pieces, and selling. No clear objective or story. Just simple smoking. If done correctly and realistic, I believe this would be so fun. Looking at different strains, going to a weed shop, unlocking new pieces, getting money, spending it, getting all kinds of accessories and equipment. Growing and exploring a map. Going to the store and getting junk food. Basically just real life smoking but in a video game. Sorry if I sound like an idiot but it sounds really fun to me. "
as320y,MKX Krypt style survival horror kind of,"Hello, I had this idea of a game similar to the mechanics of Mortal Kombat's Krypt system of traversal but oriented into a more survival horror experience like Resident Evil/Silent Hill meaning that you solve puzzles to progress the map and those puzzles are in the same area like the mansion from Resident Evil 1.  Not so much about action and combat just there to keep you on your toes. I would like to get some feedback on this from you if you like the idea and maybe give me some brainstorming ideas about the setting and the story or how it could be enhanced.\n\nThanks in advance!"
artnzz,Any game ideas for 3D multiplayer?,"The platform is Roblox. It can have a bad rep on the internet, but it's a very viable and profitable platform. I have a successful game already (it's an open world police/criminal roleplay), but I'm looking to make some more games. Games are usually 5-25 players, but can be up to 100. My target audience is anywhere from 10-18. Players have their own character. This can be overrode or removed for any type of game, but it's not common. It's a platform where you can just hop it any game server and start playing, so a game which has long rounds or something won't be a good idea.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not looking to have to make a lot of special content (like lots of vehicles). I can get a map done, small assets, as well as advanced programming. I'm open to all types of game ideas. Thanks!"
awapj9,A simple yet interesting sidescroller,"A pixel 2d side scroller with an infinite map. you start up with a car made up of a few blocks, as you get further into the map you start encountering ""ruins"" (dungeons) where in some you can only acces if you have a tiny car or a big car. As you progress further into the game you make your vehicle bigger and bigger with different blocks you find. (as i mentioned the size limit on dungeons) you may need to make a makeshift vehicle bay using blocks that hold a different car inside your main one, maybe even a gate to close and open.\n\nAs you get quite far, you encounter enemy vehicles. All made of different blocks. If you manage to kill one, they drop the blocks they had on thier vehicle unless you broke them before they got killed.\n\n(Something like TerraTech, just as an 2d sidescroller with dungeons)"
awantq,A fantasy RPG in which you control a defensive tank hero who has no offensive options.,"I know what you're thinking. Yes, this is inspired by *The Rising of the Shield Hero* anime.\n\nMost JRPGs have a well-rounded, jack-of-all-trades protagonist. In this game, the protagonist has no attacks at all. Instead, all your abilities and spells are defensive and you must use everything you have to defend your party as they cast slow but powerful attack spells.\n\nSince you only control one character, the combat would be real-time and almost play like reverse Whack-a-Mole as you run around using all your defensive abilities to protect your glass-canon mages.\n\nThe story would revolve around the typical well-rounded, jack-of-all-trades hero rounding up a party for some heroic quest. That hero's history is personally tied to the plot; his village was destroyed and he was the only survivor or something. However, that hero dies in the opening chapter right as you join the party. In spite of the fact that you have no fighting ability, to step up to the plate to continue the quest without the hero."
aw7u48,Tactical RPG fight maker,"This game concept is inspired by Mario Maker. But obviously quite different.\n\n\nThe concept of the game is you can ""build"" your own RPG fight. You only design 1 fight, nothing else (No story, no quest, no shops, just 1 fight). So you choose the characters of the players (their abilities, their life points, their attack, etc), and you also choose the same for the ""monsters"".\n\n\nActually publishing your fight scenario would cost 10 game points, and would require you to CLEAR that fight scenario. Game points could be won by completing other people's levels, or by paying real money.\n\n\nEach published fight will have stats. Win rate %, Number of tries, number of clears. And more importantly, there would be a leaderboard where the top UNCLEARED fight scenario with the most tries will be at the top. It would be seen as an ultimate challenge where players try to beat the top fight.\n\n\nThere would be an advanced search engine where people can find fights of the desired difficulty level, potentially with various possible themes.\n\n\nFights would not contain any RNG.\n\n\nTo add complexity, we could consider for each fights adding a mini shop (with a set ammount of $) where people can buy various items before the fight."

Too many games have animals hunted the same way over and over. This should be more open to multiple approaches.\n\nHunting a giant rhinoceros-like creature? Trick it into charging towards a spike trap. Drop down on top of it from an above tree branch.\n\nHunting an agile marine creature? Jump in the water with a carving knife and wrestle it. Try to hit it with arrows from above. Try to lure it shore with bait.\n\nYou can even bring other hunters along with you to use teamwork and bring down bigger game. Sometimes you may encounter rival hunters and must fend them off but too many encounters and you may provoke a full scale attack on your own tribe’s settlement.\nOccasionally defend your settlement from predators."
aw36bn,"A kingdom-building game where the choices you make build the kingdom, but only indirectly","I can imagine this as being how it would actually be as a monarch of a nation. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Concept*** \n\nYou start with a tiny little kingdom. You are asked to make decisions about the kingdom, from simply binary choices (do you want to build a granary or a smith to utilise the waterwheel?) all the way to massive, kingdom-defining decisions (are we going to prepare to be a warfaring nation, or, are we going to focus on more economic interests, or, are we going to become the diplomatic middle ground of the local nations?). Every aspect is controlled by the player, but only indirectly, through advisors. The kingdom grows physically, economically, and culturally under the weight of these choices. Many wrong choices could lead the kingdom into turmoil - there could be a total collapse, or even a revolution leading to the player being thrown out of the palace, French Revolution-style.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Idea Size*** \n\nThere is a lot of scalability here. You could have very simple graphics (basically a colour-coded map), all the way to fully rendered, beautiful graphics. The game idea is dependent on the story the player creates, rather than the graphics of the game itself. I think that the writing would take a long time in this, as potential outcomes of the choices will make or break the game, so every choice and it's outcome will need to be carefully considered in the design phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf it does get picked up, I would like to help out where I have time, and I would like access to alpha and beta phases to help test the game. A post-release copy would be nice, too. "

Player is not controlling anything yet.\n\n•You finally wake up and go to bathroom. Still no input.\n\n•You go to sink, look in the mirror. Besides dirty worn cloths and face, you see bionic eye, arm and ton of some minor stuff. All that just stands still and nothing else. It's time to do anything already, take a soap e.g.\n\n•When normal arm almost touches stuff player told it to handle, other quickly takes it and  shouts: ""WHAT THE F...""lashback.\n\n•U party hard w/ people u totally don't know, but they r cool anyway and also u r drunk enough to don't care.\n\n•One of them says: ""Hey guys, I have some magic thingies here, let's summon hecking random spirit and see what happens next!"" \n\n•You don't actually believe in all that paranormal shiet then why not lol.\n\n•When everything is done, all light offs and you fall down unconscious...

Yeah, it's what you imagine - you've read it here first, folks!","Take a top-down view vertically-scrolling classic shooter and combine it with Tetris!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou've got a whatever-vehicle at the bottom that, by shooting blocks that fall from the top of the screen, depending on the spot they were hit, they move left, right or rotate. In typical Tetris fashion, when they reach the spot behind the player, they form semi-lines until they're ""full lines"" that can be cleared (or the player gets a back-bomb as a bonus that clears an X-radius spot behind him, depending on the size of the back-bomb. They can be combined).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nObviously (ha!) the player shouldn't touch the falling bricks, nor the lines behind him. As time passes, and half-lines behind him start towering, he has less of a playfield to ""manage"" the falling bricks that, combined with the ""do-not-touch-them"" aspect should add more to the shoot-y than the puzzle-y aspect, balancing them."
avvc8n,Does this exist?,"It is a battle royale game where instead of the area to play in getting smaller, the players get bigger. When a player kills another player, instead of getting all of the items they got, one item that is randomly selected is what you are able to get from killing another player."

avn1w0,"Here’s my idea for a game called DreamNest. I know this isn’t a video game, but it’s an idea for a story in dungeons and dragons, so hear me out. Also I would like to mention this is a long one, so take your time.","You and some buddies are traveling around the town and look for an inn. The next day after you rest you hear that an old temple needs cleaning, and why not, you need the money. You go over there to clean. after cleaning the rest of the temple, you come across the Statue of the Specter, one of the gods.\n\nAs soon as it’s touched you end up in this giant cave, and pop in there like you woke up from a giant dream, with you’re life being the dream\n\nThe religion the temple follows is called DreamCatching, and is the laughing stock of religions. The religion states that the world was created by many gods with all of them containing insane amounts of Dream.\n\nEvery living thing has Dream, but the more you have, the stronger you are. I know I know, very original. Anyways you wake up in this cave\n\nYou see a town across the river and head over there. As soon as you reach out to something that you realize you have a tattoo of a dream catcher on you’re arm.\n\nNow see the prophecy states that 7 hero’s of pure will break the cave and save DreamNest. 6 players and 1 NPC. The people of DreamNest have been kept in the town for ages and don’t even remember how they all got trapped, but they’ve tried and can’t break the cave walls \n\nThe real reason they are trapped, and this is a spoiler, is because Specter fought many gods, took their soul and trapped them in this world they don’t remember. Hint, hint, who the final boss is.\n\nThe towns people have no dream inside of them, except for one person who is the 7th hero, who has dream inside of them by accident\n\nThe adventure is you traveling in between worlds of reality and dream, while you have to price together what happened in the real world, and get to the end in the spirit.\n\nHopefully you have good feed back and I want to make this story of mine as good as possible ;)\n\n\n\n"
avmmsk,Does this game concept exist?,"The game is an online multiplayer game where players create dungeons (mazes where you fight monsters and get gold an weapons) and have other people play them. If they die in the dungeon, the person who made the dungeon gets 100 gold. If the person playing makes it through, they get 100 gold. This gold can be used to buy weapons. To afford certain traits of the dungeons you make, such as new loot, more monsters, etc; you go on quests or play other people's dungeons to get diamonds or gold to get features and weapons. The weapons can also be used to fight in other people's dungeons. Does this exist? If so, how do I tweak it?"

avfwup,Staple enemy bodies on yourself.,"I've always had this idea after watching John Carpenter's The Thing. Once an enemy is incapacitated, you glue their ragdoll bodies to yourself wherever you choose. Thus you now use your new amalgamated abomination to move around.

avcy8y,"You play on a GameBoy in the back of a car, while things happen in background.","I don't know if this has been done, but I'm thinking about a game where you play videogames on a handheld device, but the whole point of the game is things that happen around you while you play, like dialogues of other people and such.  \n \nI guess this doesn't make a full game, but more like an ""interactive experience"" as they call short film-like games. \n\nAlso, if the player can affect the outside world or is just an inattentive observer diverges into completely different games, it would be cool if what you did in the videogames affected the things that would happen in the ""real"" world."

av9f11,A creature breeding game - but what kind of creature?,"Here's the list of possibilities I came up with, please let me know which you like and feel free to suggest alternatives! :)\n\n**Fish Hybrid**: An imaginary kind of fish combining elements from goldfish, bettas, lionfish, and other interesting fish.\n\n**Airfish**: This is a fantasy cross between a flying fish and a bird; they hover or swim through air.\n\n**Bird Hybrid**: two options here, this could be either a plump **ground bird** like a chicken, pheasant, peacock, pigeon, or dodo; or it could be a **perching bird** like a parrot, bird of paradise, or songbird.\n\n**Griffin**: This would be different combinations of bird types and cat types; might possibly expand to include dog type bodies and bat/dragon type wings.\n\n**Fantasy Horse Variants**: Although this could include normal horses, there would be a lot of accessories they could have like horns, wings, more deer-like legs and feet, bird feet, fox or lion tails, etc.\n\nOther possibilities I'm more dubious about: Flowering plants instead of animals, farm animals like cows, sheep, or goats, scarab beetles, butterflies, or dragons.  What have I not thought of?  I'm sure there's something cool that hasn't occurred to me at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(Note: I wanted to avoid anything strictly realistic, like real breeds of dogs, cats, horses, cows, sheep, fish, or flowers.  This is because I want to make a graphical system where creatures can have different shapes, colors, and patterns in any combination.  I also definitely won't do something copyrighted like pokemon.)"
av9al0,SquirrelZ,"Basically a game in which there are different forested areas. \nDifferent trees which represent difficulty, with different kinds of undergrowth. The areas below can be full of natural predators \nfor squirrels.\n\nThe different forest areas could be interesting too.. California redwoods. Spruce tree forest.. Forest on a mountain face.. City scape where the squirrels climb on buildings.. \n\nForests divided by different ""danger areas"". Rivers. Fires. Kids. Roads. Open areas where hawks can get them. Cats. In the cityscape: icy roofs, drunk crazy people, people with bb guns etc.\n\nThe squirrels could move in the trees up and down, on the limbs, jump from tree to tree. Like parkour athletes on steroids that they are. They could do flips, run to the top of the tree at full speed and catapult to another .. Able to do some sort of super dash every minute or so. Doing all sorts of flips etc on the way. Giving more points on time dash game mode. \n\nThere could be different squirrels. Lightest being flying squirrel that can fly the furthest, thus making it easier to reach the next tree.. There could be heavier squirrels like fox squirrel that could \nbe better at fighting the natural opponents below.. There are tons of squirrel species so there are no limits here.\n\nDifferent game modes: \n\nThere could be a time dash. Where the squirrel has to reach point B from paint A. The hardness level could be set by how far apart the trees are and by what lies below. Caught in the open ground the squirrel would not do as well as jumping from tree to tree. \n\nThere could be a run where the point is to make as many bonus points as you can, jumping different kinds of flips etc as you jump from limb to limb, tree to tree. Building to building.. \n\nThere could be some kind of battle mode that would not interest me. But clearly squirrels have all sorts of enemies..  \n\nWhat inspired this? We feed squirrels and through the years we have seen some INCREDIBLE feats done by them. They do not seem to adhere to laws of physics. They can run up a brick wall. Do jumps that would compared to human beings jumping 50 - 100 meters.. Running straight up a tree chasing another squirrel, like they were sprint athletes on super steroids. \n\nSquirrels used to be the pet of choice in US in 1900'es and for a good reason. They are damn cute critters which probably would keep the kids / girls interested too.. \n\nSquirrelz! "
av58pm,"An open-world Star Wars RPG/shooter in the vein of Bethesda’s Fallout games. Taking place on one planet, like how Elder Scrolls takes place in one province.",Except ES I and II.
av4wez,An open world crime game with extreme creative freedom in how you do anything.,"I’m guessing you’ve played gta online. My idea is similar to that, but takes a more sim-style approach to that meaning no flying bikes or cars that shoot missiles or submarine cars.\nYou start off the game as just a low level crook but throughout the game you learn new skills, (hacking, using guns, driving) and as you continue to do those things they start to get easier control-wise. Say at the start of the game where it took an extremely hard puzzle to hack into a camera, later on it will be a very simple puzzle and so on. \n\nDifferent players choose different roles in this criminal society. Some might manufacture guns that players can buy if they want to pull off a heist, some can try to steal the guns **as** the heist.\n\nSome might be hackers, some might sell insider information about certain banks, some might be drivers, explosive experts, crime bosses, drug dealers, hitmen, etc...\n\nThe better you are at your job, the higher your cut is, if you hire a bad crew, you have a higher profit but I higher chance of being caught by the cops or killed.\n\nThe catch is, the game is perma-death. This isn’t gta, if you die you are dead. There are hospitals and if you are shot or killed by someone they almost always go to jail but once you die you have to start again. Maybe you get to start from a certain important point but you get your stats brought down or reset shrinking your cut in future heists.\n\nThe heists themselves will be very dynamic and player-driven. \nOne player could rob a bank oceans 11 style and pretend to be a swat team dealing with robbers that aren’t actually there, another player could go in guns blazing, another player could blow up the safe using experimental military tech they stole from a military cargo ship passing by the city. If you are creative enough you can commit the perfect crime and walk away rich without anybody even knowing they were robbed."
av4837,Forward Air Controller in Vietnam,"In the game you take the role of a FAC (Forward Air Controller) in the Vietnam War. You fly in your light O-1 plane above the jungle, spot Viet Cong or listen to incoming requests. You have to coordinate artillery strikes and ground attack planes, not to hit each other, and hit the right targets in time. Keep in mind, that the planes on the field have limited speed, fuel and ammo, and shells have travel time too. You have to prioritise based on the mission and the situation, and make the best out of FUBAR situations, when life and death hang on your decisions."
av29gc,Playground Gunship,"This  game will be a rail shooter from the perspective of a futuristic gunship  that is really a toy in the hands of an child running about a playground and other mundane environments. The player will control a ball turret on the bottom of the  gunship as the child's unseen hand maneuvers the gunship through a playground environment.   \nThe  player has two forms of attack: A pair of machine guns and four wing  mounted missiles that regenerate slowly after launch. The machine guns  are direct fire, but slowly build up heat. Once the machine guns are at  max heat they can't fire until cooled. The missiles are guided and will  steer themselves toward the point on the ground the player is aiming at.  Missiles will be both area effect for taking out clustered enemies and  they will do greater damage to hard targets.  \nThe  enemies in this world will be imaginary demonic imps about four inches  tall. Their color scheme will be black with a purple outline and red  eyes (Black and purple will not be used in the normal world's color  pallet). When killed they will vanish in a burst of black and purple  particles. These imps may posses inanimate objects such as toy vehicles,  quad-copter drones, or playground equipment. Such objects will appear  black and purple until the player shoots away the imp infestation.  \nImps  either in their humanoid form or possessing inanimate objects will  shoot gobs of red energy at the player. Their shooting will be  moderately inaccurate but the occasional stray shot will cause harm to  the player if the player doesn't shoot the shooters first or shoot down  the incoming energy globs.  \n\n\n**NPC's**  \nThe events will be narrated by several toys with imagined sentience who are fighting the demonic imps along side the player.\n\n  \n**General  Teddy** is a teddy bear with a stetson and a pair of small round glasses  who speaks in a early 1900's Atlantic accent. He will command the ground  troops and tell the player where hotspots of imp activity are.  \n**Sergent  Verdi** is a green army man who leads the other army men. He will send  worried messages prior to the player's strafing runs and messages of  gratitude after successful  strafing runs. Speaks with a Hispanic accent.\n\n  \n**Ace McCloud** a Sopwith Camel  pilot who flies through the scene from time to time. He will function  like the wing men from Starfox occasionally helping with strafing runs  or shooting down/getting shot at by enemy planes. Speaks with a heavy  Scottish accent and has an antagonistic relationship with an imp who  always possesses a Fokker dr1 toy (red baron plane).  \nAt  the start of each mission there will be a cut scene where general  General Teddy will brief the player and other toys on the nature of the  infestation and any boss imps about. The boys hand will then come down  and pick up the player's gunship as the POV shifts the the gunship's  ball turret. Once the player's POV is in the turret the boy will  dissapear and the mission will begin.  \n\n\n**Levels:**  \nThe levels will be locations which a young boy will visit with his toys, such as:  \nBoy's Bedroom  \nPlayground  \nSister's Bedroom  \nParents bedroom  \nBackyard  \nLiving room  \nGrandma's house  \nGarage/laundry area  \nKitchen/dining room\n\n  \n**Boss battles:**  \nSister's Dollhouse  \nLawn mower in the back yard  \nModel train set  \nGrandma's Walker  \nDirty cloths monster in laundry hamper  \nKitchen utensil monster made up of a blender, spatula, and turkey baster.  \n"

auuo9q,One eel against the world (or at least what's trying to destroy it),"You play as an eel with cybernetic arms and legs, and defend the earth from eldritch  horrors, FPS style.

Nyarlathotep is your man on the inside.\n\nIt's like doom but with less blood and more comedy.\n\nSue me."

This game in the right hands can be game of the year. Sorry for the long text. Tell me what you think 
aurik4,Open world RPG that takes,
aukfpe,A game where you play as a cult fighting against other cults and the local government for control of the town/nation/whatever.,"Think a weird mix of CK2 and cultist simulator. Most of the map would be made of government/tiles at the beginning with each player starting with one tile, but you will not be able to immediately see the other cults in a specific tile unless you have planted a mole or encounter their influence. You will slowly spread your influence through force, persuasion, seduction, silent coups, manipulation, and more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe world set I thought of might draw inspiration(plagiarize) from the works of H.P. Lovecraft, Stephen King, miscellaneous horror writers, and set in the modern day, or Victorian Period.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMost people would be unaware of magical happenings in the beginning, but would be slowly be: given magic, turned into a vampire, put under some sort of trance, corrupted, killed and resurrected through necromancy, infected with some strange parasite, and maybe more. Players might need to worry about attracting too much attention from people/government, and risk having to fight the government early on. Multiple cults could occupy the same tile and this will drive most of the conflict in the game."
auk14i,Detectives Versus Terrorists,"I was thinking of a multiplayer game that plays out like a single player game in which you are dropped into a bunch of different scenarios either as a detective or terrorist and have to blend in among NPCs to go about your objectives.\n\nBasically the terrorists objectives would be to destroy or kill while remaining unnoticed and detectives would have to locate terrorists and arrest them while bringing their objectives to an end.\n\nNPCs would play a major part in this game as both the terrorists and detectives are relying on them as much as possible to blend in as an ordinary NPC meaning the opposing teams usernames are not displayed above their character and you are assigned a random NPC model each round to play as. Holding a certain button will also allow fluid NPC like movements and actions so that there is no way of telling if they are a player or not unless they break out of this action and decide to do something (even then movements would still be as close as possible to NPCs) \n\nPossible list of scenarios could contain plane/train hijackings, presidential assassination, jewellery store heist and more (feel free to add suggestions) now I know a few of those scenarios would likely cause some controversy especially since you are playing as a terrorist and doing some horrible things that mirror real life attacks but at the end of the day it's a game that is supposed to push barriers.\n\nI'm thinking the number of players should probably be 2 v 2 maybe 3 v 3 max to keep it as least congested as possible since NPCs will be covering almost all the population, also thinking if one side should be first person while the other is third person? Maybe both third person. What do you think?"
aui0x4,"An 80s-style single screen game on a planetary base, where your shots defend Solar Panels from aliens, and the solar panels give you the energy to shoot...","I thought of this one about 20 years ago. You have three guns on the base: lower right, middle, and left of the screen. It's kind of like missile command, but with much faster traveling shots, all three going at once, pew pew pew. Controls are simple; left and right move the three cursors. Button 1 shoots. Button 2 I'll explain in a bit.\n\nYou have thirty solar panels, three rows of ten.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\[sky\] \[sky\] \[sky\] \[sky\] \[sky\] \[sky\] \[sky\] \[sky\] \n\n\[sky\] \[sky\] \[sky\] \[sky\] \[sky\] \[sky\] \[sky\] \[sky\] \n\n\[sky\] \[sky\] \[sky\] \[sky\] \[sky\] \[sky\] \[sky\] \[sky\] \n\n\[sky\] \[sky\] \[sky\] \[sky\] \[sky\] \[sky\] \[sky\] \[sky\] \n\n==================================\n\n..........o...o...o...o...o...o...o...o...o...o.............\n\n.............o...o...o...o...o...o...o...o...o...o..........\n\n.......**\^**..o...o...o...o...o.**\^**.o...o...o...o...o..**\^**.......\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlien ships come in from above and drop bombs, trying to hit the solar panels that power the base's defense system. You can shoot the alien bombs in addition to the ships. The more you shoot, though, the more it drains your energy bar on the side of the screen. If you are accurate with your shots, you can save your power easily. If your bar is depleted, you have to wait a second to fire.\n\nThere is a brief night cycle between levels. No charging happens, but alien attacks also weaken (in early levels). Every night cycle, two random panels are repaired. Morning is the beginning of level 2 and so on. Each level is a little bit harder than the last. Night attacks very gradually get harder.\n\nThe problem is obvious, right? The fewer panels you have, the slower you can charge, so the less you can defend the panels, and you spiral into death once you hit an untenable point. Because of that, what I thought of way back in the day is that broken panels themselves are the second line of defense. If you press button 2, something (admittedly stupid) happens. The broken panels chuck off broken glass upwards which destroys bombs above adjacent panels. So if a broken panel is next to a whole one it may be defended. This requires no energy, but it can't be done as often as shooting. Shooting has a very, very high possible rate of fire if you need it, but chunk-chucking is only about once a second.\n\nAlso helpful is that aliens miss more, the fewer panels you have. You can hold on with one panel for a surprisingly long time if you're lucky, to eke out existence until night/morning repairs.\n\nIf you lose all panels, shooting will eventually make you go BELOW regular depletion energy levels. This causes the force field defense of the guns to disappear (where the population is hiding btw), and it's a game over in seconds, day or night. Special-case perfect accuracy bombs will take all three guns out. Byoom!\n\nOther things I thought of as a kid were holding down the attack button for a powerful beam attack that would just wipe the sky if you pressed left/right, but its power drain was incredible. And if you had full panels already at night, two would not be repaired obviously, but rather two panels would be bolstered (different color) to take an extra hit. The idea was that eventually the game would become so hard no one could reasonably survive, but the early game preparation could let you hold out later on for a long time.\n\nI think there were bosses, too, but that got a little away from the simple 80s flavor, so I'm not sure if that kind of thing is necessary."
auh5vk,Higher or lower game but with steam concurrent players on games,
aufzdc,"We have medieval fantasy, modern fantasy, and even futuristic fantasy, but...","There are very few early 18th-mid 19th century games with a medium-heavy fantasy presence. \n\nThis kind of fantasy is what I am thinking: Fireballs flying alongside/against musket balls, cannonballs that split in 3 mid-flight, starforts gaurding precious artifacts, common line infantry fighting against mythical beasts, etc. And ofcourse no universe is complete without a deep and dark lore.\n\nI think this would work best large numbers (100s to 1000s) of entities (player or NPC) on a single battlefield. Imo this would be best as either a persistent MMO or a RTS."

au7qja,Last Hope : Beuganon,"I was watching I Am Legend just before, and thought ""wow, how is this not a game yet"". So I decided to make my own spin on the core concepts of it, and add abit of Division's Survival Mode. \n\nTHIS IS JUST A CONCEPT, LITERALLY JUST WROTE IT\n\n\n\n\nSet within the fictional city of Beuganon, located on a large island just off the cost of New York City. Considered a super city, Beuganon is twice the size of New York City, hosting an abundance of massive skyscrapers, apartment complexes, and large underground metro systems, which some survivors have chosen to take refuge in. Many people across the globe believe Beuganon to be a part of a US government conspiracy.\n\nAfter a group of scientists had a breakthrough in finding the cure for cancer, the unstable cure was prematurely distributed in the form of a free vaccination. In as little as a week, 90% of those whom received this vaccination have transformed into bloodthirsty, light fearing mutants. Luckily, the US government have managed to contain this man made plague, banning all entry to Beuganon until a cure can be developed. \n\nThe story of Last Hope follows the player character's efforts to find a cure, which they are doing by experimenting on a captured mutant with the use of their own immune blood. The player's story begins as they awaken from a deep sleep, later entering the bathroom to clean up; this is where the player is able to customize their character's appearnce, gender, and partial voice. After the player is finished customizing their character, they collect their starting equipment, a pistol and a small backpack, and are left to their own devices.\n\n\n\n\nShould I develop this idea further? "
au7eji,MASSIVE Territories game - The whole world is the battlefield.,"So ive had this niggling idea for a game for some time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIts a mobile game - integrated with google maps - the world is your playground - Competetive multiplayer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe world is split up into different territories with a grid like structure. Each 'territory' or piece of land could be 10x10 meters for example. Players would start the game owning no land and with a small force of infantry. There would be two ways to take a piece of land: Be the first to go there and it becomes yours by default, or, attempt to fight the defending forces of an already owned territory... in the latter you would obviously only then own the land should your forces win - loose and your forces are depleted and will take time to recover before they can try again or even actively defend territory you may already own.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMore land means more people. players can divide their population into 2 groups - dwellers and fighters. more dwellers = more resource more food more money etc, more fighters = well, more fighters :D.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe fighters would also be split into 2 forces - attacking and defending - defending forces would be assigned to territories you own that border others or that are likely to be challenged by others and the attacking forces are the ones used to invade and try to take land from other players.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCertain 'hotspot' areas will exist - town centres and the like - some sections of land in these areas would come with bonuses - the ability to create better / stronger units and such. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere would be other important places, if you manage to take a certain amount of territory within one of these places then you would receive the benefit:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOwn sections of an industrial town? awesome - more bullets produced / extra money etc...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe game would require integration with google maps and GPS to be enabled as that's really the crux of my idea.... In order to take a territory or a piece of land, you would have to physically go there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlayers could slog it out on their own looking for easy pickings until they grow stronger and make a name for themselves - alternatively players could create / join their own factions to team up with other forces and move towards total world domination.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI believe a concept such as this delivered properly could be an absolutely HUGE success"
au75g5,"Instead of building a city, you improve existing neighbourhoods","Due to the focus on neighbourhoods, the game engine can focus more closely on urban design: street design (bike paths and bike bike parking, trams, buses etc) and building design (down to windows, balconies, colours, murals, street art, materials and other design features). The building environment changes based on your changes. You can attract creative businesses. You can attract certain demographics.

ayg28a,Game story idea,"The setting is an idealized small, 1950s town (at least it appears to be). \n\nYou play an average dad with job, wife, 2.3 kids, etc. Your life seems Truman-show perfect, until you see a strange woman in the street. She yells, in a computerized vocie, that there is ""danger"" and you must ""wake up"". \n\nNo one else seems to notice her. You brush it off and continue with your life. You're at the office, making water-cooler chit chat, when an alien monster appears from nowhere and brutally kills one of your coworkers. No one seems to notice. \n\nThings keep getting stranger. Sometimes the wall of your bedroom looks like a bulkhead, with blinking lights. Sometimes the gravity changes suddenly and everything floats for a while. \n\nThe big reveal is that you're actually in cryosleep on a deep space exploration ship. To help your brain handle the extreme time you'll be travelling, the ships AI had created this false idyllic reality for you. The woman in the street was the ships Ai, and she was trying to warn you that *something  unknown has boarded the ship* and is killing the other sleepers. \n\nSo the game alternates between the small town dream and gritty, alien isolation-lioe SciFi horror. When you're awake, you can move around the ship and try to hide from the alien. But you need to return to the Dreamworld periodically, whether to preserve your own sanity of just access parts of the ships AI. \n\nThat's all I got so far.

ay45k3,Goblin Town Building.,"**Setting**  \nThe world is primarily fantasy with some old world and ancient aesthetics and technologies *(i.e. 90's style computers and large mechanical golems).* Immortal travelers *(adventurers that respawn)* hunt and sell monsters to grow in strength to defeat the big bad at the center of the continent. The game is instead based on the outskirts where few villages exist scattered about. In this world there exist the higher races (e.g. humans) and lower and less intelligent species *(e.g. goblins, wolfmen, etc.)* who're hunted for training and resource purposes. The player may hear news of the big bad or the ""heros"" progress but will never have direct interaction as a lowly goblin in the sticks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Game Start**\n\nIt's an RPG with the player being a cute lil Goblin who's just been enslaved after Immortal Travelers destroyed their nest and entire tribe. The player was not killed but enslaved as they demonstrated human-like intellect *(i.e. begged for their life).*  The player is to be sold off to the mayor as a rare prize. The player later locked in a dungeon and eventually escapes, coincidentally interrupting an assassination against the mayor (owner of dungeon).  After combat and dialog you're giving a rickety shack outside of town and given a rare citizenry pass where the mayor vouches for your trust-worthiness (prevents town's from enslaving or attacking you like they would a regular monster).  \n\n\n**Gameplay**\n\nIt's a third-person RPG with a combat similar to BOTW but with a focus on using your small goblin body to easily engage and disengage in fast-passed hit and run tactics. The player can farm, hunt, collect rare materials, explore local areas, take on odd-jobs/social quests to earn trust, doll their goblin up in many different outfits and some armors, sell their stuff at shops, hire carpenters to renovate their shack into something respectable. Think BOTW and D&amp;D meets Stardew Valley. Unfortunately for the player, not everyone respects the artificially enforced ownership rights of a simple goblin. Adventurers, thieves and Immortal Travelers may try to take what you've built. The player will have to build basic defenses, hire mercenaries, buy defense technologies and perhaps build a small community to help defend their property (and life). As the player needs to be ready for anything, this should enforce a gameplay loop where the player:\n\nWorks for items **--&gt;** sells or trades them **--&gt;** invests, then decorates and upgrades home **--&gt;** repeat\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm actually planning to build this game myself over a couple of years but want to refine the idea. Any ideas on whether it's a decent concept or if you see any issues? I'm unsure if it's a bloated idea or not, but a cute goblin decorating their home, playing dress up and fighting off bandits and whatnot seems cool."

axuqd4,Any simple ideas for mobile?,"So im deciding on learning java, and basically anything in the android studio toolkit. I have 0% knowledge on how java works, but tend to learn as i read the docs, etc. I want some ideas that sounds great but isnt a 3D rendered mess, or something that needs servers to be ran(im not spending more then i already did for a developer account). I also hope on making some cash off of it, by letting users watch ads for some currencies or something, but nothing intrusive where ads pop-up at random, user chooses to see an ad for rewards.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# A few ideas i have.\n\nSo, although i maybe end up doing these, i want to see what a huge group wants, i dont want to make my first mobile game, no... my first GAME(I have created a website and other things, but not a game) be a flop, so if the ideas i have are not stuff the community wants, then im willing to create one it does.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. A Shoot-em-up, where you play through levels, gaining levels and some currency. You can then use skill points you made to upgrade certain abilities, while with the currency you can buy different upgrades, cosmetics, etc. The Shoot-em up will be with ships, with some levels having you play as something else(where you can also buy upgrades, etc for).\n2. A City building type game. You run a city that was gifted to  you by your father after he passed. You have to take care of buildings, crime, the people, services, etc. to try and keep your city alive, and you also have to manage to keep yourself alive, too. As people from other cities(AI's) attack your city, and most likely you. If you die, you basically ""lose"" your save forcing a restart, but your last city is still there, in shambles after the mayor has died. Also, should have said this earlier, but you can also raid other peoples(AI's+Your last ones) cities, so you can raid your last city to get most of what you had back. I also hope to have it have servers where you can also raid other real life players once i make enough from it to handle the server fees.\n3. Something like pixel dungeon(a mobile game), where you explore through dungeons on a 2D plane. You collect loot, sell loot, upgrade loot, upgrade skills, craft tools, And also can buy real estate, like a shop to craft weapons for customers, and your dungeoning service, where you get an item from a dungeon for a customer."

Have some combat like that of a fps like borderlands or something thrown in.

axmufu,Zelda with combineable equipment,"I was watching a Game Maker's Toolkit video about synergies ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=terD4Bk3L\_8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=terD4Bk3L_8)) in which the narrator Mark notices that in a card game there could be 20 cards with unique effects with no synergies, but if there are 10 cards with synergies between themselves, there are 100 ways to combine those cards, which creates more options with fewer cards.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLately I have been thinking the item progression in Zelda games. I think that a natural way to move Zelda's item system forward would be combineable items.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor example every item could have an action and an effect. And the player could use items as they are or combine these, mixing attack pattern from any  item with effect of any other item.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor example:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|Item|Action|Effect|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Sword|Hit|Cut|\n|Shield|Defend|Blunt / Heavy|\n|Whip|Whip|Rope / Grab|\n|Boots|Move|Earth|\n|Trident|Jab|Water|\n|Bow|Shoot|Thunder|\n|Bomb|Throw|Fire / Explosion|\n|Boomerang|Arc / Returning|Air|\n|Wand|Spell|Ice|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd some combinations with these items would be:\n\n* Sword + Shield = Hit with Blunt = Club\n* Shield + Whip = Defend with Grab = Enemy weapons get stuck in your shield\n* Boots + Trident = Move with Water = Flippers\n* Bow + Whip = Shoot with Rope = Grabbling hook\n* Bomb + Shield = Throw with Heavy = You throw a heavy rock that can be used to press buttons\n* Sword + Boomerang = Hit with Air = A fan that blows air\n* Wand + Boots = Spell with Earth = Create blocks of earth, like Cane of Somaria in A Link to the Past.\n* Boomerang + Whip = Arc with Rope = You throw a rope that flies in arc and returns to you. Traps enemies in front of you.\n* Boots + Wand = Move with Ice = You freeze the water under your feet, granting the ability to walk on water.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is just a raw idea of a patterns and effects, and I haven't thought of every item and every effect all the way. But some games have been doing things like this before. For example Genesis game Gunstar Heroes had this kind of system where there were few weapons which could be combined, and in GBA game Castlevania: Circle of the Moon had similar system.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn my opinion this kind of system feels really good to use. Especially in Castlevania: Circle of the Moon I was very excited to test all the combinations whenever I got a new item. If the player can switch the weapon combinations only at resting places, they would be forced to plan their usage accordingly: The player should think carefully which combinations they are going to need against different situations. At cold environments the fire-effect would be very effective so maybe they want to use fire effect in their sword. But then they can't use bombs, as bombs are used for the fire effect. Maybe water effect would be useful as well, as wet enemies tend to freeze in cold. And so on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe point would be that this would increase the number of functions on items without increasing the number of items themselves so much, and the player should think and plan ahead what they are going to need in each situation beforehand. In the situations themselves there would be fewer options. In my example set of items there are 9 items, so if each were to be combined with another item, the player would have 5 possible items to be used. Those would be quite easily managed in menus and such.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't mean that my suggestion is the one we should talk about. It's just an example of the idea. The idea is that by combining items you force the player to make decisions with which they have to live with. And I think that this could fit into Zelda-type games really well, especially after Breath of the Wild where the physics and chemistry engine were already used in pretty well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do you guys think?"
axj0c3,Magic Game Idea,"I know that I posted something similar 3 months ago but I just cannot shake this idea. \n\nBasically, this would be a magic game focused on preparing for adventures, researching the arcane, building a base (so you can research and prepare), and exploring trippy magical realms. Basically, this is a proper game about being a mage who becomes powerful through rituals, research, exploration, and crafting. All the magic games out there I can find are essentially FPSs. A common theme is for most/all items to have many uses and consistent properties that can transfer to most/all crafting aspects of the game. \n\nA good start to the game that illustrates what I have in mind is starting as an apprentice in a castle. You have to do a few things (which are foundations of the game) like brewing potions, enchanting weapons, summoning golems and casting a protection ritual on the castle. An enemy mage destroys everything and you vow to defeat them. \n\nI'm envisioning this as a 2D game who's gameplay is closest to a simpler Thaumcraft with the combat of Wizard of Legend. Of course I can't find anything even close to what I'm thinking so these are rough approximations. \n\nAs for a few features, these are just a few ideas I've had:\n\n-Minecraft like potion system except is organized a bit differently. The base would determine the effect (like a snake would be poison), then a reagent would determine the context of the effect (resistance potion, blade oil, thrown potion, TW3 black-blood like potion, etc). Then perhaps a certain process you do (like heating vs stirring vs freezing) would change how it works (like (h)dot, armor piercing, burst damage/healing, etc)\n\n-Smithing where you can create wands/staffs and robes from different materials (which line up with potion effects). An example would be a snakeskin robe for poison. Enchanting could make the robe either amplify your poison damage, resist incoming poison damage, or something else. Wands are the same concept. You could make a snake tail wand that affects poison damage/duration. \n\n-Enchanting where you can apply extra effects to your robes and wands. This is where you decide whether an effect is used offensively or defensively, along with how it's used that way. It could also be something simple like making a sword into a fire sword, or ordinary armor having a special effect. \n\n-rune crafting. I was thinking of being able to equip multiple runes that cast certain spells passively. Examples could be wards against certain damage types, a continuous damaging field, one that passively summons minions to help, amplifies damage to something, etc. It would be cool to craft these runes based on certain rituals that require certain amounts of items. To run with the snake theme, maybe a ritual sacrificing 20 captured snakes you find let's you craft a poison cleansing rune that will clear poison effects from you quickly. Maybe there are tiers ranging from mild resistance/ damage boost to immunity/ crazy damage. \n\n-Voodoo magic that let's you weaken a certain enemy type temporarily through a ritual. It can also be used to buff allied minions in certain ways temporarily. \n\nThese are just some examples to show what I have in mind. The gameplay loop is research at base--&gt;prepare for adventure--&gt; explore surreal places like The Abyss, the Underworld, Valhalla, etc--&gt; use new items to discover powerful new spells and items. \n\nThe game is meant to be a slow sandbox/adventure game that makes you feel like you have earned all these cool magical spells and artifacts as opposed to making you just a fire ball throwing dude. None of these are concrete must-haves but I think they capture my idea well. \n\nWhat are everyone's thoughts?"
axis6x,Felicitous Desiigned Timmy Turner VR Game.,"It's a reach today but in the near future it may be possible to take Google Duplex, Google Assistant, Character voices, develop Cosmo and Wanda Avatar AI reactions maybe similar to the Monsters Inc Laugh Factory at Disney and add appropriate twists to the algorithms to spawn AR interactive 3d models from the Hololens demonstration for young kids to play with. Obviously cut Vickey from the franchise this time."
axioac,Universal AR Trophy Room,After the hololens 2 live stage demonstration I feel like turning a normal room into a video game trophy room would be necessary. Like mounting deer on a wall and fish you catch that sing or to show off your super hero suit. Pretty much make the software adaptive enough to partner with any vr game developer and in return people will grind the games for achievements and/or spend money on virtual gear.
axhy4i,A city building game inside the ruin of another city,A city management game where when your old city fails you have to build off of the ruins of your old city.\n\nThere is a RimWorld mod named real ruins where it spawns ruins of other player's colony's.\nI think a game based off of this mechanic would be so cool.\n\nYou would be able to make your own culture\n(Sort of like frost punk but with more of a focused on small laws) and when your city fails\nYou have to use  the scraps of your old one to try to scramble together a new one Or if you make a statue of a city member the new city might think you worshiped them as a god and follow them as such.\n\n\n
axhguk,An MMORPG where your character grows in size as you level up,"Crazy idea that popped into my head:\n\nA grindy rpg where each level means you get x% larger in size from your previous level.  This is multiplicative, so at 2% per level, a level 100 player would be about 7 times the size of a level 1 player.  With no theoretical cap on level, a player could become titanic in size compared to a new player.\n\nGear, however, won’t grow in size.  So you outgrow your armor and weapons after a few levels."
axfmeq,An Xcom-style SCP game.,"This was just a random thought, but I think you could make one hell of a game from this idea. Say you've got to manage your facility, secure, protect and contain. As well as send out a squad to collect new unidentified anomalies. Each anomaly giving different challenges and more. \n\nMaybe with new anomalies, you had to find new ways to contain them by designing your own containment facilities and therefore having to expand your facility. Say one of your containments fail, then you have to fight to regain control etc. \n\nI was thinking this could look exactly like X-com enemy unknown and would actually be a really entertaining game to play too. It's also well within the realm of possibility. \n\nNgl if done right, this game would be awesome. "
axetpx,"City builder, but you have to build something tight like Kowloon Walled City","And not in 2d. Fleshed out, 3d, AI from the residents. I just think it would be fun...."
axcprd,"A 2d game like hillclimbracing except you can only see the terrain along direct line-of-sight and depending if you reach higher or lower terrain while ramp-like jumping, its like you are navigating a high dimensional maze with between 1 and many finishlines and many paths from and to many 2d places","As a math person, I'd technically describe this as undirected graph topology where nodes are  polygons that have up to 3 linelike portals to adjacent polygons. As a gamer, I'd say it like if you drive around a thing, like jumping over it then back to where you started, you are not always where you started."
ax97rl,"A zombie game with physics-based player movement, focused on the deadly close quarter struggle when they try to pin you down.","This idea came from those mostly non-interactive cinematics in Resident Evil 2 Remake in which a zombie grabs you. It's only under certain conditions you can fight the zombie off, and even then it's only done through a QTE. ""Wouldn't it be cool if that event was fully playable and completely dynamic?""\n\nTo pull this off, this zombie game would need physics-based player movement.\n\nExamples of this type of dynamic player movement include Human Fall Flat, Gang Beasts, Grow Home, I Am Bread, Octodad, Surgeon Simulator and even QWOP. They trade in the broad player commands of normal games for more granular control of your character's body parts.\n\nIn this zombie game, you full control of your character's arms and hands. When a zombie gets close enough to try to grab and bite you, you have to manually use your hands/arms in such a way to shove them off without them biting you. You might try to bat its arms away and then shove past him, or if it grabs you, you might be forced to wrestle yourself away—like the ghosts in Luigi's Mansion—all while using your hands to keep the zombie's chomper at a distance.\n\nTo take full advantage of this dynamic physics system, the game would let you pick up anything in the environment to defend yourself. You can pick up a chair, for example. It's all still physics-based so if you manage to hold the chair in just the right way, you can pin a zombie between the legs of the chair for even better leverage. Every object still has weight, so the chair can tire your arms out quicker or slow your run speed compared to holding a broom. \n\nIf you hold a ladder sideways, you might be able to keep a wall of zombies at bay, but their combined force will certainly push you back instead. However, if they pushed you back through a doorway like this, then the zombies will jam up the doorway themselves as they unwittingly press the ladder up against the doorway. This type of dynamic physics-based interactivity really opens up a lot of gameplay possibilities."
ax8ic9,An MMO/Moba PvP Hybrid with some BR elements.,"Shooters have always been a massive stock in gaming, I'm not crazy about them but I play a good few of them, R6 Siege, Overwatch and sometimes Apex although I'm not a fan of BR. I grew up on WoW PvP and eventually League of Legends and sometimes I kind of miss those simple days. I'd like to see a game with the fantasy spell mechanics of WoW and LoL but on a large arena type map with different levels similar to Overwatch.   \n\n\nI would make the main play mode 4v4 with different kinds of objectives like king of the hill, escort and defend/attack item kind of like the Nexus in Moba or items in Rainbow Six Siege. I think giving the game something very custom like classes, character names and cosmetic looks would be nice. I'd like the camera to be similar to an MMO where you can toggle it. I kind of like the idea of having this all optional on a BR type map but at the same time don't want to saturate that genre even further. Instead maybe add items onto the map characters can find like armor or speed boosts.   \n\n\nI would give each class 15 - 20 different abilities with only 6 allowed in game so that you have to customize your ability builds. Maybe add passive stat trees for each class, the main problem with that is they always become cookie cutter but at least the potential for variety might be there.   \n\n\nI would give the game a few different classes to choose from however can't think of anything very specific.   \n\n\nBruiser Melee DPS  \n\n\nFast paced melee DPS  \n\n\nAssassin type of DPS that has possible mechanics that support the team  \n\n\n2 Different kinds of healers area and targetted heals.  \n\n\n2 Different kinds of tank a shield tank and a control tank that is less tanky.  \n\n\n2 Different caster classes, one is burst ranged dps while the other is damage over time effects  \n\n\na ranged melee dps, this one would have a gun or bow or maybe have the option for either or.  \n\n\n  \nI am not a game dev, I've never thought about this before but I would like to see a game with some of the current FPS and BR elements but with fantasy type characters as seen in MMO's and MOBAS"

awv6q1,OpenTTD Style Concept,"Alright so, ive been dreaming of this idea for a little while now, and it goes as follows\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou are in control of a transport tycoon as the title suggests, and you are shipping\n\nmilitary goods in addition to all the previous industries. The map borders will have neighboring \n\ncountries that your country may find themselves at war with, or maybe becoming allies, \n\ngranting you access to another countries economy/profit. You would ship materials to make rifles,\n\nships, fighter planes, tanks, clothing, food, etc. to the frontlines to keep them supplied.\n\nThrough aiding your countries conquest you gain access to more resources to further advance \n\nyour countries troops, or possibly turn to the civilian sector. Or both!  As for the countries themselves\n\nyou could find yourself under a peaceful democracy or a ruthless dictator, based on how your country \n\ndevelops. I.e a great depression may bring a fascist/communist dictator who may give your company \n\norders for you to survive, transport (X)goods a year, or no trade with (Y)country.  You could even open the door to the ideas of revolution, and supply rebels in a civil war. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's my idea anyway, im sure there is a bunch more ideas that could be added to this"

awsogm,You take control of a boot camp to train soldiers for war," Imagine Prison Architect but instead of managing a prison, you manage a boot camp.\n\n A massive conflict has begun between two countries and you’re in charge of training your nation’s growing number of recruits. These recruits will vary in quality, from eager volunteers to mediocre draftees. You will have to get these men in top shape in order for them to win the war, and probably survive. Large quantities of recruits would arrive to boot camp once a month or two. Drill instructors can be assigned to a chosen number of recruits, who can either be experienced in previous conflicts or completely inexperienced.\n\n You will have to create firing ranges, barracks, obstacle courses, mess hall, parade square, etc. There will also be training grounds for specialized troops such as engineers, flamethrowers, tank crewmen, artillerymen, and much more. You will have only a certain amount of time to train recruits until they are assigned to different units or to the frontlines.\n\n These soldiers would be sent on missions where their efficiency would depend on the quality of their training. If a mission is successful, you would receive an increase in money to build more infrastructure in your boot camp. Surviving troops also have a possibility of returning to the boot camp to serve as drill instructors.\n "
awrt89,Action without generic attacks.,"Let's say it is isometric roguelite. You have to choose a class with a set of it's own active skills and then start wiping dungeon from floor to floor as always... But you don't have just simple punches or shots, only cool-looking ass-kicking snake-eating class skills. Imagine throwing a stun grenade at bunch of enemies, then creating a blackhole in the center of room and spawning a giant donkey statue on the top of that.\n\nMay be really hard to balance all that but here are my thoughts about some moments:\n\n•There still may be some relatively simple fast-reloading attacks, but they are getting weaker if overused, so player must keep them for that moment when this is necessary.\n\n•There is problem of just standing and waiting for the end of cooldown. It can be fixed by slightly reducing time of ones each time any of remaining skills is used efficiently, thus encouraging aggressive but considered behavior.\n\n•There is what to choose even in general focus:\n\n 1)All keyboard is binded and catch is to remember what is what and where it is.\n\n 2)Fewer skills and fixed short cooldowns, but each enemy is vulnerable only to specific combination, maybe even in specific order.\n\n 3)Ok amount of skills, ok time of cooldowns but PC has absurdly small amount of HP, so you can even call the game Glass Rocket Launcher, lol.\n...\nThat's all for now, thanks for reading. \nIf anything, including grammar, is fucked up somewhere, pls let me know."
awqxj6,The New Natives: A game about colonizing and being colonized.,"It is going to be some sort of strategy game centered around lasting as many rounds as possible.\n\nBasically the theme of the game is that you control some group of settlers who've managed to displace enough of the old natives to become the new natives. However, at that point a new group of settlers now want your land, and you must defend it at all costs. Of course, your defeat will be inevitable and once you lose you get to play as your invaders who now hold the title of being the new natives. Repeat ad infinitum."
awoo75,Procedurally Generated Racer Royale,"TL;DR- 50 people race on foot through procedurally generated labyrinths, they must race through 10 increasingly complicated levels, the first person to cross the finish line wins.\n\n\nThe camera can be third or first person, and your player character moves much like you did in the game Mirror’s Edge. You can run, jump, slide, wall-run, climb, and you even have some very basic attacks to be used to throw your opponents off balance or to even eliminate them by pushing them into a deadly trap. Motion should feel fluid, you can simply tap the jump button and you’ll vault over an obstacle, but if you run and jump, holding the input, you’ll jump much farther and higher. By timing and selecting the proper duration of button presses you should be able to feel like you’re playing old school Assassin’s Creed, with your character moving over obstacles like water over rocks. \n\nLevels function like tile sets. Level 1 is just a single tile, but it can be any one of the assortment of tiles, level 2 adds one more tile, and it continues on like this until they reach level 10. The trick is designing tiles that function like Legos. Coming up with an art style that allows you to mesh all these tiles together would be paramount. In my head I’m thinking like a Pseudo-Natural environment, where it all looks like a normal forest, but it’s clearly all part of massive artificial construct. Maybe it’s Virtual Reality, maybe it’s an Alien Game Show, it doesn’t really matter.\n\nTile Example: \nLevel 1 is very basic because it consists of only a single tile, it’ll have one or two deadly obstacles, but it’s mostly just about finding your way to the exit first. \nLevel 2 steps things up by adding another tile, adding at least one more deadly trap to the labyrinth. Level 2 also introduces power ups. With each level more and more traps, as well as power ups start to appear. \n\nPower Ups:\nBoost- gives you a quick burst of speed, allowing you to jump, wallrun, and slide farther.\n\nHover- for a short period if you hold the jump button while in the air you hover and gently float down to the ground.\n\nArmor- gain a layer of protection that prevents other players from knocking you off balance, as well allowing you to survive some traps.\n\nHoming Tag- feel like another player knows something you don’t? Shoot them with the homing tag, their outline will become visible and you can follow them.\n\nInvisibility- Don’t want anyone to follow your trail? Turn invisible for a little bit, this also cancels anyone’s homing tag.\n\nGrapple- a rope and hook that allows you to climb, swing, and jump, it’s a single use item and remains intact, so you’ll also be helping out anyone behind you.\n\nDouble Jump- allows you to use a double jump for 10s.\n\nExit Flare- a very rare pick up that causes a flare to shoot up from the Exit gate, signaling to you, and everyone else, exactly where the exit is.\n\n\nI just felt like coming up with a Royale game that doesn’t follow the exact same formula as all the others. Plus I miss Mad Dash and have yet to see any other games where you race on foot.\n"

Not total war style with constant battles and marching but more like managing the growth of a town and deciding what gets built and where. I like the idea of slowly expanding my town until I have my own fiefdom, perhaps I'd build my own castle and train guards to keep the peace. Maybe theres a system for choosing my household staff, etc.\n\nI'd love to be able to sit in my hall and have my villagers come to me with problems and have to make decisions that would influence how loyal and happy my subjects were. Perhaps a combat system to direct battles to defend the realm, or defense from raiders.\n\nThe closest thing I can think of is Mount N Blade, but that's too combat centric and less political then I'd like.\n\nDoes this game exist? \n\nIf not, could someone make it for me plz, fancy playing it this weekend."

"
b0o6x8,What about a horror VR game where main wears glasses,"A horror game where the main mechanic is the player has glasses, and when they are knock or hit, the glasses fall off and it gets blurry. Granted it would not be a pleasent experience but as a glasses wearer, theres nothing scarrier than losing glasses and bumbligg around as some horror looms over you, and you have to find those glasses to get out.\n\nI really feel for characters in movies where they loose their glasses, stumble around, and the big baddie crushes the glasses and kills the character (the mummy is a great example)"
b0jlvw,Guild Centric Fantasy RPG,"I'm thinking first and foremost combat is similar to Dragons Dogma, light and heavy attacks with other skills unlocked as you increase in rank.\n\nHowever, instead of having one character you role play and level up for your entire play through, you manage a community, or a guild of ""champions, or heroes, or something."" You can switch between characters while in your ""base/home-camp/settlement,” but when you go out on quests you are committed to that character/party.\n\nSomething that would make this unique is a permadeath mechanic similar to State of Decay. If you die on a quest and do not get revived or rescued, that's it, that character is dead and you have to create/recruit/select a new one. Any gear or items they have on them are lost. \n\nBut you aren't truly left at ground-zero as the main focus of progression is not individual character leveling but leveling different aspects of your community I.e. blacksmith (armor and weapons), library (spells), temple (cleric-based spells)."

b09k5z,Hand motion capture sign language game,"I'm big advent of the belief that video games are an extremely effective tool for learning. And after seeing Moss character Quil communicating to the player using sign language it really sparked my imagination.  If we could make a game where the player interacts using sign language it could go along way in teaching people a new skill. There's a lot of ways you could do it, maybe you want to cast ruins or signs, but their strength depends on your fluency with sign language, or maybe you can interact with an npc but only through sign language, struggling to get a point across with the little knowledge you may have so far. Or maybe a puzzler where you need to perform the correct sign, racking up in  difficult as you would go on to eventually having to sign full sentences\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlus, if the game is a success, and uses say ASL, it could go along way in standardizing the language in other countries.

b09k3y,A horror/action game with mice.,"The plot is about a bunch of mice that want to find some promised land with food and safety. The problem is the predators, which obviously are out to get them. I thought the predators would look like eldritch horrors, like some Earthbound Giygas stuff. If not that, atleast make the player pay attention to their surroundings. Grass slightly moving is a snake, a shadow on the ground warns of an owl overhead etc."
b07ygd,Multiplayer Prisoner's Dilemma Card Game,"This is a mobile-based card game. It's kinda like The Prisoner's Dilemma, a famous psychology case study. In this game, there are four cards in each round. Each card would have pretty illustrations on it, for cosmetic purposes (if possible, product placement, mine data). The goal is you have to chose a card which you think other players won't choose. There would be lots and lots of players in one lobby and you don't know what other players are choosing. At the end of the round, if the card you chose is least chosen, you (and others who chose that card) would earn the most points, while players choosing the card that is chosen most will earn the least points. For example, 15% of players chose card A and 35% chose card C, and so on. Those who chose card A gets 30 points, those who chose card C gets 15 points, etc.  Repeat each round 10 times, and at the end of the game, whoever earns the most points win. \n\nWhat do you think of this game? Will it last long?"
b07rpq,Horror type of game - need help fleshing out characters,"The vague idea is that the main protagonist is a cute little boy that tries to fight his demons in his dreams. It's a 2d sidescroller metroidvania kind of game.\n\nHe traverses spooky rooms, with a torch or a flashlight with which he can achieve some stuff.\nThe idea is that he has kind of an alter ego, a type of killer, that has a weapon of shotgun to get rid of the ghosts, zombies or whatever.\n\nSo the type of game you face with one or the other is different: with the boy is more of a runaway or puzzle solving thing, while with the killer is about, well.. kill enemies with your gun.\n\nNot sure if the characters auto switch for some specific event or if the player can change the  character he plays with on purpose for some reason, every now and then.\n\nAny ideas on how to make the active character change? Some game event? Something in the story that determines with which you have to play at a given moment?\n\nAny original ideas are welcomed! Thanks!\n"
b044a2,"A horror game that purposefully drops the framerate when the monster shows up, but the monster itself renders at full speed.","The game's engine is made to always render at a smooth 60fps, but at times it will repeat frames to simulate slowdown and frame stuttering. This is done to make the player think the game is optimized poorly. It's made to look like the game's spooky rendering effects, which kick in when the player's character is ""scared"", are too much for the engine to handle.\n\nHowever the framerate *really* tanks when the monster shows up, even if he's not on-screen. And when the monster appears in front of you, no matter how low the framerate dropped, the monster comes at you at full rendering speed. It's almost like he doesn't belong in the game."
b0319r,"A video game like Devil May Cry or Bayonetta, but in reverse.","So intstead of playing a hero trying to kill monsters in the most stylish way possible, you would play a series of monsters. There would be a ""hero"" of the game, who would be pathetic and clumsy and your goal would be to make them look as stylish as possible. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo there would be stuff like trying to predict the ""hero""'s awkward flailling to attack a space they where about to move out of(to make it seem like they dodged), moving around to make sure you would get hit by hilariously inaccurate attacks, ect."
b01cgc,"A Combination between Plants vs Zombies, Sanctum and Pretty much every Mobile RPG (for example: Summoners War)","Hey,  \n\n\nI had this Game Idea for a long time now and i dont think i will ever make it myself so i thought i would just post it here \^\^.   \n\n\nThe short version of the Idea is as follows:   \n\n\nYou have simple plants that you can grow in a Garden, you take those plants and modify them with different augments. By modifying the plants, they become ""active"", meaning they can attack stuff. You then go to a level, take a pre defined amount of plants (you choose which of course) and use them to defend your base by placing them infront of your base.  \nthe game would be in first person and you can create a labyrinth if you want so enemys have to go a longer way until they reach your base (just like Sanctum), but if you completly block a path, they will attack your flowers an maybe even kill them.   \n\n\nSo this was the Short Version. Now onto the more detailed one:  \n\n\nAs mentioned, you will use Plants to Protect your base. How you get them? You buy them in a shop. Just normal Ingame currency, no microtransactions. Every flower you get can have a different attack pattern just like in PvZ. You can have Plants that attack with a single shot, or with Multiple shots at once. or throw bombs etc. There could also be support plants, that either heal damaged flowers or give buffs to nearby flowers, or tank plants that are just there to block the enemys, they would have a lot of health so enemys would take a lot of time to kill them.  \n\n\nOnto Augments:   \nAugments would be stuff, dropped by the enemys, you can then collect. When you turn a plant into a ""weapon"", you can either give that plant augments with it, or just leave it as it is. Augments of course beeing the better alternative, but it could for example make the process take longer or cost more energy or whatever. What do augments change? Augments can change the stats of a plant, for example giving it more attackspeed, or more damage, or more hp and so on.   \nBut every augment comes with a drawback. For example more damage means a bit less attackspeed, more attackspeed meaning less damage etc.   \nYou could also find rare augments that give plants abilities like fire shots for dot effects, or ice shots for a slow.  \n\n\nThere is ofcourse some other stuff that could be added like, combining  two plant seeds to get a completly new plant out of it. same with augments. Every plat could have a certain amount of augment ""space"" and every augment would require a certain amount of space. And if you use an Augment it is gone so you have to think twice if you want to use a certain augment on this particularly plant or keep it for later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTell me what you think about it, would really appreciate some feedback \^\^  \n\n\nps: English isnt my main language, so sorry for any spelling mistakes or grammatical errors \^\^"

A Metroidvania but with some intentional parts removed. There are no guns and weapons instead the game uses a Mario system, jumping on top of enemies. The upgrades in the game revolve around improving the players ability to traverse and solve puzzles.\n\nThe story is the thing I'm currently working on and is even harder to pitch right now because I have no idea what it will be. The fictional story will also be an allegory for my life experiences. Throughout the game there will be audio logs to find that tell my story.\n\nNow you may say: ""Trevor isn't it arrogant to make a game about yourself?"" To which I say, I don't care. Gamedev is my therapy. I think that my honesty in the design and story is what will make it stand out."
azs2r6,A rogue-like where you control the four elements,I thought of a rogue-like game in the style of Enter The Gungeon or Nuclear Throne but instead of having your character chosen in the start menu you can hop from one to another in-game. 4 characters are available and each have powers linked to the element that they control :\n\n\- Fire element can burn enemies with fireballs.\n\n\- Earth element  is specialized in melee and gets double the damage with it.\n\n\- Water element can control water if the room has it and can send waves to drown enemies\n\n\- Wind elements uses wind to move the enemies and deals damage with it.\n\nCharacters die within 4 hits and will be unusable. \n\nI've also thought of bars for each character that would fill whenever you kill enemies or deal damage. When the four bars are full. You could unlock an over powerful fifth element that you can use for a short period of time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;

azoz07,Burnout Royale,"So now that Battle Royale has established itself as a defacto Genre™, I think a Battle Royale racing game is in order, and what could be a better fit than the core elements of Burnout (particularly Burnout Paradise) with its car combat and open world navigation.\n\nPicture this: 20-30 cars drop from the sky into a big ol' map full of roads, shortcuts and trickjumps. Every car starts out as a beat-up junker but upgrades are scattered throughout the map to make your car faster, stronger, boostier, better handling, etc, and they're mostly placed on trick jumps and shortcuts to encourage exploration, as well as random civilian cars that give you upgrades when you take them down.\n\nBasic BR rules still apply, there's a circle that slowly shrinks and the last car standing wins, but rather than guns, cars simply have to ram each other to death to secure victory.\n\nSpecial powerups may include:\n\n- A car-canon that can launch you to another spot on the map\n- A super boost that sends you rocketing at top speed towards an unsuspecting target\n- Greese traps that heavily reduce handling on your enemies\n- A powerup that lets you ""dash"" left and right fot a short amount of time, basically a sort of power-nudge that breaks physics and lets you smash people you otherwise couldn't smash\n\nAll in all it's a pretty broad idea that I think would be super open to all sorts of wacky ideas being tacked onto it.

azkfup,A game made for the steam controller,"Hey all, \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   I was thinking of messing around with Unity to make a game where you control two characters at once, using both of the Steam controller's touchpads .  An overhead style game where your two characters have to navigate the game's world (which I haven't thought about at all) and face baddies, gain new abilities, etc.   - I'm posting for feedback about the game's core mechanics.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat I am thinking of is that one touchpad controls one character, the other pad controls the other character.   Moving your thumb over a touchpad would be joystick move style to move that character about, and when you hold-click on that touchpad, a touch-menu comes up over that character with the abilities they have (as well as a ""cancel button"").    \n\n   When you release your click, it selects the ability you were hovering over, the touch menu disappears. and a targeting arrow pops up over your character.  At this point, the touchpad controls the targeting/rotation of the character, and highlights the things that can be interacted with by the ability that you have selected.   Press once more and the ability is executed.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, that is the basic idea.   What do you guys think? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;"

azhs46,New competitive style game,"Hi guys, I would really appreciate if you read this full post and tell me what you think of it and what I can improve. So I have had this idea for a while where I want to create a 6v6 competetive base building game. It is kind of a mix between a survival game and a moba.\n\nEach team will get a spawner which they have to place down on a location they think is best. If the spawner isn't placed before one of the team members has died he can't spawn back into the game untill it is placed. The objective of the game is to destroy the other teams spawner. If a team is wiped out before they have placed their spawner they are also defeated. Players can use different kind of materials to build a base around their spawner to protect it. The game takes place on a island with lots of trees and rocks and even some animals on it. These are used to build up your base and to stay alive. In the first 2 minutes there is a wall in the middle of the island that seperates the 2 teams so they can safely put down their spawner. After 2 minutes the wall dissapears and everyone can roam over the island without limitations.\n\nBefore the game starts each player can choose between 3 kind of classes: the builder, the hunter and the gatherer. Each class with its own specifik skill set.\n\nThe builder: This class is very good to build up your base, this class can build much quiker and more advanced things than the other classes. This class is also very good to forge weapons.\n\nThe hunter: This class is best for hunting food and to kill and protect gatherers so the other team falls behind on building their base or to protect your own gatherer from getting killed. the hunter is also very good with the bow that he gets for free when spawning. Players can also die from starvation so it's the hunters job to make sure that there is food for everyone.\n\nThe gatherer: This class is used to gather wood, st\none and other materials. This guy is very strong and he can carry way more items then the hunter and builder can but he is very weak in combat and needs much protection. Players earn experience by doing things there character is supposed to do, for example, a builder gets experience for building a wall or making a weapon but if he decides to hunt for materials he won't get any experience from it. Experience points can be used to upgrade perks which are specifik for every class. If a hunter gets enough experience he can choose to upgrade his aim, or to receive more food from killing animals. These are just examples I want to create a very large skill tree to really make players think about what they should spend their experience on.\n\nThis game takes a lot of teamplay and strategie to win. Players can choose to play a very aggresive playstyle from minute one and try to get the enemy spawner in the first few minutes by picking 3 hunters, but this tactic can also backfire because if the other team manages to survive they will have lots of materials to build a stronger base and better weapons so they will be much stronger in the late game.\n\nWhen the players are selecting their class they can't see what the other team has picked. So it's always a gamble on what kind of tactic you're going to use. Are you going to sacrifice a gatherer for another hunter? This might lead to following behind on technology and materials.\n\nIf a player dies he is still in the game but he has to wait a certain amount of time depending on what stage of te game you are in. So if a player dies in the first 5 minutes of the game he will have to wait for 2 minutes but if someone dies in the 30th minute of the game he has to wait for 10 minutes. This is a crucial part of the game because dying really matters. If a hunter dies you're gatherers will become unprotected so one of the other teams hunter might hunt him down. If a gatherer dies, then your builder will have a lot less materials to build with and the other team will have a stronger base.\n\nThere are a lot of different types of animals on the island ranging from chickens to bears. Chickens are very weak and won't give you a lot of food and experience but are an easy target. Bears are the strongest animals on the island, they will take a lot of damage and they can hit very hard. But if you manage to kill them they will give you a lot of food and experience. There will be lot's of other animals.\n\nThere are also a lot of different materials on the island. in the first stages of the game wood and stone will be the most important to build your base but later on materials like iron and sulvur will become very important to make weapons and ammunition. There will be more materials.\n\nI am also trying to implement some elements into the game that can turn the game around. For example something like a baron in league of legends where the losing team can get a buff that brings them back into the game for a certain amount of time. I was thinking of some random events that happen in the game where there is some sort of giant animal and if a team kills it they gain a massive amount of xp.\n"

azbuzk,Traditional cars and wipeout-style AG racers in the same game,"Name\nsomething something extreme racing 2150\n\nConcept Overview\nSomething like f-zero/wipeout but also with traditional cars that handle different from the anti-grav vehicles.  Multiplayer-focused and as mod-friendly as possible.\nPlot\nPeople race cars and space ships and stuff\n\nSetting\nTracks on earth, various other planets, maybe a track built out in space with reduced gravity or something.  Game can probably launch with 3 tracks, saving man hours for mod tools, netcode and balancing.\n\nCharacters/Abilities\nGame probably needs to launch with 6 cars at the most (modding community can do the rest).  3 wheeled vehicles and 3 antigrav vehicles.  The different vehicle classes would control differently and have different ways to get fast lap times.  The AG vehicles would have simplistic, angular designs (think f-zero) while the wheeled vehicles would be futuristic versions of various supercars (no licensing required, in case anyone is concerned)\n\nGameplay Mechanics\nIt's a sci-fi arcade racer with netcode-friendly vehicle physics.  No weapons, up to 30 cars on the track (And 30 players in online multiplayer.)  The main feature is the 2 different types of vehicles.  Cars would be classed as either wheeled or AG-wheeled vehicles could have more grip and a handbrake while AG vehicles could be able to do f-zero style sideslips and turn in midair.  This all depends on what keeps the vehicles balanced.\nVR support in a game like this would be awesome but I'm not sure how feasible it is for a small team.\n\nStandout Features\nWhat makes your game really stand out or fun?\nSense of speed, potentially unlimited replay value from multiplayer and user-created tracks/vehicles, being able to approach the same track differently depending on what vehicle type you're using.\n\nPossible Platforms\nWindows, possibly Mac and Linux\nExtra Features\nBiggest challenges would probably be (in no particular order) netcode, making the game data-driven, balancing 2 different types of vehicles, especially designing tracks where both vehicle types are competitive and fun to use.  Keeping the framerate at 60fps with 30 cars on the track and still creating a sense of speed is probably a challenge too-as far as I know only Nintendo has ever done that.  \n\nyourgameistoobig.com estimates development cost at $77k.  I ticked the boxes for vehicles, ""both pve and pvp"" (to represent online multiplayer), modding tools, and also ""expertly designed and polished GOTY contender"" to represent the challenges of balancing 2 types of vehicles (that usually appear in racing games with drastically different level design) and possible VR support (vr + 700mph + mods pretty much is GOTY material in my book).  Not sure how big a team this game would need, probably something similar to 34bigthings, however many people they have\n\nHow To Credit You\nCredit me for what?\n"
azaal5,"Nation-building game similar to civ, but it takes place over multiple planets.","When you get enough technological advancement, you can establish interplanetary colonies and compete with other nations on that front. Otherwise is a regular strategic nations/war game.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe main difficulty I can see with it is that we haven't done it yet in real life, and thus may not know what factors to include in the game to foster good strategy."
az9yil,Game Idea: LI (Last Island) (raw title)(open world survival),"\*\*Note: This game might be too big of an idea, but it's an idea I like to share even if its not made.

There tons of resources in building, houses, cars, and other places. About 60% of the building contain NPCs hiding inside. You could find another human, aliens, robots,  or even corrupted government. You will either scare them or they will fight back.\n\n\*\*You will need to find an human with skill locksmith so until then you have to break into buildings quietly.\*\*\n\n\*Once you tamed a human locksmith you will have the skill locksmith unlocked. The human doesn't have to be with you.\*\n\nOnce you free roamed, leveled up max, and to the point where you strong enough there a part of the island you must travel to.

az4hip,Random Idea: Sakesphere's Tempest or some Sakesphere's Play turned into an action game but with very bad acting.,"It will be a shooter game set in a future cyberpunk dystopia. But still talk like Sakesphere while over acting every scene. You shoot a badguy, the guy dies with dramatic acting while still being dead serious about his acting. In COD, u mow down so many enemies, it gets repetitive. Here, you kill only a few badguys in most of the various missions. Like ""In Bruges"" movie where Colin Farrell was killed by Ralph Fiennes which takes several minutes just to kill 1 guy.\n\nIn Bruges Spoiler:\n [Started in a hotel. Pregnant hotel manager telling them she's not going anywhere, arguing while shooting at each other, he jumped on a gondola, got shot, then got chased through the neighborhood, then finally killed.]"
az4eyz,GotM: We want to realize a game idea every month," Hello /r/gameideas!\n\nWe are a group of Swedish game students that are starting up a small indie game studio called [Macaroni Studios](https://macaronistudios.com/). We are working on a concept we call GotM (Game of the Month), where the community comes up with a batch of game ideas and then put them up for a vote. The most upvoted idea is then realized as a mobile game by us, in only a month, and published on Google Play. Rinse and repeat, every month!\n\nSince the games are created in only a month, the game ideas must be short and concise, so not something like an MMORPG. Here are a couple of examples:\n\n* George of the jungle, in the city. George delivers pizzas, but everyone HATES George. \n* A vertical shooter where you cure diseases. With roguelike elements.\n* Climb to the top of a mountain by hardcore-praying to the almighty spaghetti monster.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do you think of this? We would love to get your feedback. If you like the idea, we will create another post where you can post game ideas and get the first round going!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n//\n\nMickey, Frit &amp; Emil"
az0iof,SCP horror game with a lot of roguelite elements.,"**Plot**\n\nYou were a part of an armed MTF unit , who were sent to investigate SCP-[**REDACTED**], a portal to a place that resembles a massive underground cavern.While at first glance,nothing seems anomalous,a disaster occurs when deep inside the cavern, that happens to separate you from your team and you lost ability to communicate with the real world.To make your situation worse, you are being hunted by a race of pale, eyeless, hairless, humanoids.As you survive and explore this subterranean world,you will eventually encounter other SCPs that you least expected see in this world( like the infamous sculpture,plague doctor,etc).Eventually, you would discover the horrible [truth](http://www.scp-wiki.net/shaggydredlocks-proposal) about this world.\n\n**Gameplay**\n\nThe game is divided into rather large randomly generated levels with a number of creatures  and a some non randomly generated section which would contain diary entry or computer terminals, things that can explain what happened to this world.Many of the creatures and SCPs not only interact with the player, but also with each other( though with a few exceptions like the pale humanoids, who can make alliances with their own kind, most of these interactions are mostly hostile).The player character can  craft many types of makeshift armor,weapons and tools using various materials he gathered while exploring the world.\n"
