jqrp79,Reptoid part 1,"A game that switches between 3d and 2d .     in this game your friend which is a scientist invites you to a science lab where lab workers created a evolutionary serum that greatly speeds up evolution and injects it into a lizard then the lizard becomes human like and walks around its holding cell it is about to be injected with sedatives but the villain of the game is disguised as a scientist and swaps the sedative with a unknown chemical which causes it to go crazy and breaks through its GLASS HOLDING CELL!!! and attack,s your friend injecting him with the chemical through its teeth a security guard shoots and kills the reptile and your friend goes to the infirmary shortly after he transforms losing his nose skin becomes green and scales form and eyes glow green with a red pupil attacking a group of doctors and gets loose through the vents you are guided by guards to go with them so you can be safely extracted the vehicle gets swarmed by what they call reptoids you grab a rifle and shoot them through the window you have a choice drive or shoot.

jqo8d8,My dream game,"I always wanted there to be a huge MMORPG game that highly reflects a real world economy and politics taken to an extreme detail, but you still play as an individual within the economy. It would be as organic/free market as possible, with the ability to capitalize on market opportunities, mostly revolving around natural resources, there would be one massive server that goes miles long, getting larger as more players join. \n\nIt would be highly reliant on your ability to find value as a player and trade with others, which would be very slow at first, but as you get wealthier and more valuable, and build more connections, your power or influence increases as well. You would build up your net worth (a base currency of gold would exist, but bartering would be an option as well) in order to get better tools or technology, and join a coalition, community, or company of players with territory (protected by physical walls, I’ll go into that later) that can be expanded or traded, or even fought for from other companies/communities. there would be open markets, and if your character dies, everything you’ve made for yourself such as territory or finances/etc disappears. This not only makes the stakes and gravity of what you amassed important as you become a successful player, but it also helps keep griefers from having a big impact on your finances/property or trying to assassinate you, as to do so would require a big hit to their own characters wealth or even death. For example,  An individual new player that just spawned would be unable to trespass a large companies territory, as he would need tools or weapons to even attempt to break the wall, and naturally, the bigger or more lucrative the company, the more they would spend on a better walls/defenses to protect their natural resources and community) the new player would have to play for hours just to be able to purchase a stone or metal tool capable of damaging the wall, and the wall would degrade at a low rate, and there would be systems in place to notify the walled community, griefers would have to “work”/ trade for a month or more to probably afford something that would allow him to break into a community, and it would be high risk as there would be defensive measures within the community to protect them that are not known until you can get in to the territory, you would have much better luck going after other characters that are lower class. \n\neach player within the territory has their own house, and they pay taxes for the protection via the greater walled community, unless they want to risk having their own land by themselves, which would mean no taxation but less security. Their individual houses have added protections depending on the individual wealth of the player, in case they worry the community territory gets invaded. Taxes are dictated by the player that the territory is owned by, and there can be the option of tax brackets, just like our own system, so that wealthier home owners pay more, an incentive to attract lower pay newer players into the community. This is where I think the really interesting dynamics would come into play, as if taxes are too high, a player could always move to a different community or none at all/start his own if he so chooses. There would be in depth, and game-binding consensual contracts between players, that would require a good sense of deal making and business. Owners of private land/companies could choose to go public, selling shares of the company. For example, I agree to have my character do X work for X company, at this rate, for X amount of game hours. Company could provide incentives like protection or shares of the company, and there would be constant competition. \n\nI feel like the game would be a less futuristic version of eve online, but much more in depth with economic options through contracts and agreements."
k1m2ik,Zombie horde simulator/rpg,This game totally needs to be made. You have levels you have to conquer. Towns or whatever. You literally start with one basic zombie in one household or whatever. You attack and spread and gradually expand your horde. You gain some kind of xp to upgrade mutations to strengthen your horde. I was thinking a top down view. Levels would be towns and places. Boss levels army camps or large blockades. It would kinda run like an RTS but the horde would have some basic aggressive Ai so your more guiding the horde rather than taking full tactical control. As you progress in a level the area's you conquer have a zombie apocalypse visual que. Such as everything in chaos broken and burning. Just to hint there's no survivors left there. When breaking into buildings ands homes it would kinda look like xcon. Where you could see inside. Survivors can over time barricade themselves in a building and fire upon your horde and it would take time to get to them. All wile losing zombies! The police would attack the horde. Army etc so you do have enemies to deal with. \n\nThere so much could be done with this idea.
k1j9uk,Game Idea Request,"Hey folks,\n\nI’m looking for some ideas for a game, it could be also a game that you always wished for and doesn’t exists in real life. I code in Python and i’m out of ideas, also it would be preferable that the game is  2D cause im better at 2D than 3D.\n\nThanks in advance, you’re welcome if you have any questions"
k1iks0,A FPS game about the defeat of Daesh/ISIS/ISIL?,"Maybe a game where you play as the Iraqi Armed forces and fight alongside allied PMU/PMF units and  you fight against ISIS in Iraq. Covering important battles like Ramadi, Fallujah and Anbar and finally ending in campaign when you recapture Mosul and defeat ISIS's so called caliphate once and for all. I think the idea might be too controversial to be ever be made. It can take a similar style to the older Call of Duty and Battlefield games. If that isn't possible then maybe a strategy game or mod of a strategy game where you command government forces in your right against ISIS like the Syrian warfare game. Anyway back to the fps it can have cutscenes of the real life war civil war in Iraq which thankfully ended with ISIS's defeat. Maybe in certain levels allow you to call airstrikes. Also a bonus mission or DLC where you capture Kirkuk from the Peshmerga."
k1gjaw,The Matrix Royal,You and others enter the matrix to battle amongst eachother and this time anyone can opt out whenever. But first you have to get to a phone. As the time goes down less and less phone are available and ones used are now broken from the smiths. Thats right you will also be running from hoards of smiths while competing for survival and power and to get the hell out!
k1dwa4,Tunnel Royale,"This is a game of idle genre. \n\nPlayers are presented with a map of a real territory like say USA. They choose a start location and stop location to dig a tunnel form start to stop. Tunnel digging starts (idle style) , the progress of which is dependent on what and how much resources you deploy. There could be a visual representation as well. And of course they are RPG-fied meaning you can upgrade tunneling capability as you play more. \n\nNow, since this is a common shared map - other people are also digging from a start to end location. And there is a high chance they encounter others in their tunneling journey. That's where it could get interesting - there could be combats to decide who gets to move on with their tunnel based on combat result.\n\nDuring the tunnel digging the player could get various surprises like gold, minerals etc. and collect them. \n\nJust a very very raw idea, not sure what you guys think :)"
k1coa8,Point counter,"I know this will sound dumb but just listen.\nA button which you can tap that will connect to the internet.\n\nYou could get some people having tournaments on it, or just play it to increase the total.

k1cd5e,Lazarus,"Lazarus\n\n\nIn the dead period of the universe, after all stars die, a sentient being created from leftover quantum energy (add more detail to this later(it's down below)) forms a conscious being capable of utilizing the Prometheus technology. Prometheus is the ability to manipulate energy and space time either created by the manipulation of dark antiparticle annihilation or entanglement of subatomic particles (and the ability to selectively choose characteristics to apply to one particle type), which is plentiful in the wake of Hawking radiation present around black holes. This technology can be used to manipulate gravity and spacetime. The player must restart the universe, traversing multiple dimensions and facing himself in many different iterations, other quantum beings attempting to gain control of the universe. The player can change classes abilities equipment and faction/govt \n\n\nA spaceship from earth Era 2100, developed after the scientist Norman Zigreid made a breakthrough by accident on the nature of quantum gravity, discovered a way to create negative mass and gravity through the entanglement of gravitons with bosons that gave the gravitons mass, allowing them to attract themselves and create infinitely increasing negative mass. This allowed the manipulation of space time in such a  way as to create a powerful Alcubierre type drive that relied on the manipulation of time to drive the ship faster than light (like in prey how the typhon can travel 100000 years to us in minutes to them) (also I came up with this before playing prey). A malfunction in the drive caused the pilot to jolt very far Into spacetime, with the expansion of the universe slowing the drive down eventually as gravity no longer held the stars together, and the rate of negative mass gain was lower than the rate of expansion. This landed the pilot in a faraway future, with only one piece of technology, the Prometheus engine. The PE can be used to entangle quantum particles, and manipulate them by changing their state, spin, and charge. As the last human dies, the only thing that saves him is the Prometheus, (which hangs by a thread as the expansion accelerates), that entangles his consciousness with the dark matter responsible for expansion, giving him conscious control of it, and allowing him to maintain a form and life.\n\nIf the Prometheus is instead operated via antidark annihalation, the user must keep the Prometheus on them at all times, and maintain it so that it can prevent them from being ripped apart by the expansion. But I like the entanglement idea."
k19h2h,Pet Sales items sell Billions a year,"So...My dog loves TV and I  was thinking a video game + Console for your pet.\nThis means you can play game with them, but also leave it on when you are out to keep them company.\nA simple console\nA few buttons\nDurable for horse like dogs\nChew proof\nSimple commands on each button\nButtons bring video clips that your pet likes.\nMy dog has favorite commercials\nAnimal triggers \nJump scares\nButtons could bring up clips\nPets love to learn and love tv"
k18f28,Gamification regarding complex problems,"I’ve been kind of thinking about this for a while, but I haven’t really wrapped my mind around this yet. Let’s say that we want to create a magical system that is complex (like Harry Potter where magic can actually be studied as a subject), but players may not actually want to spend that much time learning about the subject and will quickly lose interest on it. Does that mean that fully immersive games cannot be developed to fully replicate real life in the future since things that seem too real (which are often tedious) cannot hold people’s attention?\n\nI think this problem is highly relevant to our lives since education has been trending towards gamification. If we can make things fun while being complex, then perhaps learning can be made an even better experience for everyone."
k179ez,Hyper casual game creator on Unity," I decided to make an asset for creating hyper casual games. With the ability to randomly generate the game. That is, by pressing 1 button, you can create your own game. How do you look at this?"
k162vu,Minecraft + Superliminal,"Game idea - The game could be like Minecraft in a way where you start out in a world and you can explore, except that the game could implement non-euclidean geometry. You could maybe modify objects in the world like Superliminal."
k13sl9,Steamship Tycoon !,"So essentially what Im thinking is, you’re in charge of a brand new steamship company beginning in the early 1800’s starting with the first transatlantic crossings and ending in the mid to late 1900’s with the decline of Ocean liner in favour of air travel. You would get to customize your ships, plan routes, hire crew, research new tech, fight for the blue riband, etc. Kinda like a combination of Railway Empire, Computer Tycoon and Cruise Ship Tycoon (it’s a cheap little iOS game). Anyways, what do you all think?"

k0sqb6,2D Platformer Combined With Some Ideas Generated From This Sub,"Basically my game idea is a 2d platformer like hollow knight. The background environment is a ground rich with small life ( Bugs, insects, small plants etc). But this environment is in a lab. Scientists are studying the insects and bugs. So they created a small environment for them. The interesting part is this lab is located in the international space station. \n\nOne day there going to be a sudden blast with lots of radiation. There are ants in this lab environment and inside the ant colony there are ant eggs. Because of the radiation one egg gives birth to mutated ant. This ant is our main character.\n\n\nThis ant is somewhat creepy. This ant can make web like spiders. Fly like dragonfly. Got sting like bees etc.  And this ant can use it powers ( mutations ) to overcome the problems.\n\nWhen each level is passing mutated ant have to give up it powers one by one. (Ex : Give up dragonfly wings after level 1 )(  Early game too powerful but eventually u have to depend on your brain,  Not powers. )\n\nThere are some levels with low gravity. \nThere are some secret mutations even the ant doesn't know ( Time travel power ??? Final Boss is The Same ant In the start of the game maybe )\n\nFinally the Mutated Ant wants to find out who it is actually. What Happened to it? \n\n\n(Player get all the abilities at first and eventually he have to remove them one by one - Idea got from this sub.)\n\nI'm a university student reading IT degree. Now I'm doing work as an Intern. I have no experience with Unity or Godot. But I got programming knowledge. This idea came to my mind because of GitHub game off. I really wanted to create this game but because of the intern work I got no time. So I thought sharing this idea with you'll would be great.\n\nPlease ignore any English language mistakes as my native language is not English."
k0mcm2,Game that uses ai,"I am an amateur indie game developer, and I am thinking about making a game that uses ai. One idea is for a 2d platformer game with more complex movement, there would be animals all over the map controlled by ai and you would have to use movements to convey what you want the animals to do as you move on."
k0f19u,"Ideas for ""different"" kind of hack and slash game?","(Sorry If I have wrong flair, idk which one fits most)\n\nSo basically:\n\nI am brainstorming a hack and slash game, which has slower pace than most other hack and slash games and instead has more... Stradegical approach.\n\n\n(Basically think something along lines of Minecraft Dungeons)\n\n\nHowever, I cant seem to come up with any unique mechanics for my game, so that is why am asking for help!"
k0evcg,A Humanoid FPS with emphasis on dynamic movement,"A first-person shooter that features  an alien species playing similar to an arena shooter. A heavy emphasis an player agency, sandbox, and movement that seeks to change the way we view typical movement in fps games. Typical team gameplay would consist of 5v5 but also openly welcome a variety of other game types.\n\nThe basic idea is that by using a alien species different types of movements and weapons can be used. Most Fps games include very general movements; the aim is to change that with this idea. Below I will go into what i deem is the most essential parts of this game idea.\n\n**Movement**\n\nNo sprint and instead utilizes a roll  and a slide as the ""big movements"". To give a more dynamic feel to the movement sudden changes in where the player looks will cause the player to stumble/slide to compensate for the change. In general, this will movement feel more real and provoke new strategies.\n\n**Sandbox**\n\nWeapons, power weapons, and utility weapons are something that would also play a huge factor. weapons function as they typically would, power weapons provide edge during battle, and utility weapons serve as only boosting the player in a certain aspect of play (provides a lot of creativity in play).\n\n**Gamemode I thought up**\n\nThis gamemode consists of multiple rounds (maybe 3-5). After each round, the map would be become smaller and a new power/utility weapon would be introduced to cause more chaos. Each round would introduce a new challenge (like capture a point, or eliminate the enemy). who ever wins the most rounds wins the match. Preferably, the map would actually be stacked on top of each other like layers. So that each round the map would actually change and get smaller."
k0c5va,game ideas: HORROR,"hi so i have posted a few times here but whatever  \n\n\nplease give me some horror game ideas  \ni am a beginner and i'm idea-starved okay  \ni don't really like the dbd, granny, pacify, plasmophobia, etc. type of game idea because theres too many of them so uh....... it would mean a lot if you could leave some ideas\n\n  \nthanks a lot"
k0bc3l,Game that captures the spirit of retro gaming,"Like retro game challenge, for example!\nIt's minigames feel like real retro games, down to being packed with secrets, but the rest of the game around it is just as good! It really feels like your playing a retro game, down to using magazines to find secrets, sharing rumors with friends, and more! The sequel even has 2 player games! I want games like that!"
k0b6il,Project Survive The Flood,I'm thinking about making this game :  your goal is to survive recurring floods by building a shelter and to extend the shelter so that you can build a city and let villagers come in.\n\nThis is a tough sell because I have done nothing yet but if you provide your email in the form below you'll receive only one email (no spam seriously only one email) with a link to download the game when it's finished for free.\n\nhttps://forms.gle/BZsQWJ2Us3RkpjU2A
k0ah43,Multiplayer Minesweeper,"\- a very large minesweeper board, or an infinite board where people can only pick points within a range of other active points\n\n\- the map begins with a single point randomly activated, if that point is a mine then a new point is randomly chosen instead.\n\n\- have multiple people able to access it at once\n\n\- have people able to mark points on the board that they would like to pick\n\n\- after every minute all marked points that are not mines are activated\n\n\- if a person marked a mine for activation then none of their other picks are counted towards activation, and only one of the mines they marked for activation is shown to them\n\n\- they can continue to watch and mark points, but those are not activated at the minute mark, and instead stay marked until they are unmarked, they are activated by another player, or the game ends in which point they will show which marked points were mines.\n\n\- Players get points for each point that is activated which they marked\n\n\- Players get combo points the more points they activate in a single round\n\n\- The player with the most amount of points once all other players are eliminated becomes the winner, or if it is a finite map, then if the map is completed the player with the most points at that point wins\n\n\- If a player does not mark at least one point for 3 rounds then it is the same as them marking a mine\n\n\- players who pick a empty spot with no mines next to it get points only for the marked spots, and not the other spots revealed around that spot that were not marked\n\n\- players can label points they think have bombs or with a ?, but those labels are only visible to the player who labeled them.\n\nThe time per round can be tweaked with testing along with the points and other variables like mine density so that the gameplay feels right. There can also be multiple choices for people, but it is best to limit it at first to make sure not to split the userbase.   \n\n\nAlso easier modes may be changed into more casual settings for instance removing the idle 3 rounds your out, and instead go for a system where you get your score recorded and it is reset to 0, but you can continue. To make it easier and less competitive for people who want to relax, or are not up to the competitive harder levels."
k094c0,A game that uses RTX to show what happens when you move close to the speed of light,"There's a wonderful game called [Velocity Raptor](https://www.testtubegames.com/velocityraptor.html) that explains the physics of moving close to the speed of light. If your dinosaur moves faster, distances start to shrink and time moves slower. It's really trippy and I highly recommend it.\n\nThe game is only available in top-down 3rd person mode, which is understandable given the limitations of the Flash code, but it's also kind of misleading. The game leads you to believe that if you stood above a dinosaur that was moving fast, time would slow down for *you*, but in fact only the dinosaur himself would experience time dilation, and a 3rd person observer would just see a dinosaur moving fast.\n\nWith the development of ray tracing technology though, it's possible to simulate the paths of individual rays of light moving through a 3d environment. You could slow down and distort the paths of those rays to simulate the experience of living in a world where the speed of light is slow. Relativity is a tough subject to understand, but seeing it for yourself would make it easier."

k06ms2,The Lost Soul - Isometric Adventure Game,"Hi all,\n\nSo I am thinking about an isometric Pixel art game where you play as a teenager, having a day to day job on the graveyard (Because yeah, you don't like to work in busy places and need some money in your pocket). At some day a young girl get buried on the graveyard where you, as the player, feel a strange feeling within you. That same night you find out, that the Girls soul is wandering the Graveyard because she didn't find peace yet. \n\nTo find her peace you need to play through the story (I am still thinking about this). But while you do this villagers find out you are talking to ghosts, and helping them, so they start attacking you. Other  way around, the Girls ghost gets hunted by other demons. Bear with me, its a rough idea.\n\nI am searching for some nice mechanics that really could bring this forward. Some I have been thinking about are:\n\n* The ability to switch between the young boy and the girls ghost, gaining new movements for each form.\n* Gathering supplies and build traps/defenses on the graveyard, for when you are out in Town to find information about the girls death.\n* etc.\n\nDoes anybody have some cool game ideas and/or mechanics to help me out with developing this idea? Would be much appreciated.\n\nCheers!"
k05k3v,"A fighting game, but mix with lightbot","I had an idea for a streetfighter like a game where it's mixed with a mechanic from [lightbot](https://lightbot.com/)  so players insert commands before the round initiates. \n\nThe gameplay loop would be a set amount of rounds (maybe more than 3) and have a different amount of commands available for each round such as 10. From there, you would try to damage the opponent as much as possible. It would have 2 players and both players can see each other's command which will also create more strategy for the game. Since making it a command would be difficult, I am thinking of adding moves such as **grab** or **pull-in auras.** \n\nThere would be 2 different ways of winning with one being knocking out the opponent before the end of the total round and the next one is when all rounds end and the player who dealt damage the most wins.\n\nThe idea seems quite broad but I think it can result on a very wacky and strategic fighting game"

jzt7co,Planet Divers - A game about falling,"A game where you are a astronaut explorer and has to enter the planets you are about to explore freefalling into it (MDK stage intro style). Along the way down you have to collect energy to dampen your fall at the end of the level. Enemies can drain your energy, slow down your fall (the faster you fall, the faster you harvest energy) and could be some rings or whatever sent your way to give you boosts and/or items to help."

jzssp3,MREs (Meals Ready to Eat),"What if something like a military themed game were to allow a player before deployment pick a MRE from a menu to bring with them before a mission. Imagine it as like a mini-backpack with a loadout of food, drink, and combinable material like sauces or condiments with each item providing temporary but long-lasting stats and bonuses. Some items even require water to cook or prepare, which will make you consider how much water you have in your canteen or any other good sources of water in the environment."

jzscek,No NPCs video game,You start out in an open world. There is some bad guy taking over the universe/ world or whatever. They have pretty much have already taken over except for a few small groups that resist. You have been given the task of starting an uprising and defeating the bad guys. (I haven't given this part a ton of thought) \n\nAs your character completes quest he becomes more and more well known. Normal NPCs will know stories about your character and people will begin to recognize him without ever meeting him before. This will also attract attention from the bad guys and will make it easier for them to find you. \n\nLucky for you your character has the special ability to transfer his soul into other bodies. When you do this your old character is now famous but your new character is only know by people the NPC knows. Since you changed your body you lose all of your skills you've built. You would still have the same knowledge and can do spells or have fighting abilities but the new character may not be as strong or have less stamina. These things would come to the new character faster since you already have the base knowledge. Kinda like playing a game for the second time. Some characters might even have better abilities. \n\nFrom here I have a million little ideas on how it would work. Things like you might need to hide items that you want the new character to have since they won't be able to go into your house/hideout since they aren't you. Or they might turn good or bad depending on how you use them while you are using them. If they turn good you have increased their skills and they will make better team mates in fighting evil. \n\nSo while I call them NPCs really no one is an NPC. You can even put your soul into bad guys it would just be harder.

So I thought maybe I should post an idea that I was thinking of. \n\n""Zeeno"" A survival game similar to those like rust but based in the far future. I'm thinking instead of a barren wasteland where you scavenge for materials, a big city. I'm thinking that there would be a kind of faction like system, and servers like Elder Scrolls Online. This game would have obvious monuments, those that I won't think of now, where you go around and gather resources to build up your faction's base or your riches. This game would have a kind of metro police always flying around that you would have to avoid whilst fighting other players or doing tasks around the city. Since this is futuristic there would hopefully be some kind of vehicle system, using resources (or some kind of shop) you could get improvements to yourself or buy vehicles to get around the city faster. It would be fps type shooting, so those that like to play shooter games could enjoy it too, and those who simply play roleplay games could also have fun. Unlike rust, it would not have server wipes, but instead, city wipes. I'm thinking a large timer hangs over each city in each server, and once that timer ends the ""police force"" search the city, and wipe out all faction bases and any players they find. Meaning that you would not lose items on you or upgrades you have, but bases and any items inside them would be lost when this timer goes off. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKeep in mind this is my original idea, and it's just that, an idea. I have no intention of furthering this, and if somebody else has had an idea similar I was not trying to copy them, I was just putting my thoughts out here."

jzl3z9,Survival-related game ideas.,"Henlo there!\nSo basically, i had these ideas for a little.. While.\nI would love to have someone rate them (Since we aren't good in rating our own creations).\nMost of them, if not all, are related to taming/survival/animals.\n\nLet's get to the list i guess.\n\nNOTE: I will be honest, and i need to say that i am not a great developer. \nI know the basic, i know how to model, but these ideas will be probably simplified in-game.\nI'm using the Roblox Studio ""engine"", so my possibilities are.. Pretty limited,sadly.\n\n\n1) One of my newest ideas is a text-based survival game.\nIt would come in two ""formats""\nYou play as an animal, or you play as a human.\nIt would have things like choices, stats, and depending on your decisions you could die or not.\nIt'd all be with sound effects and similiar things, so playing with headphones could be a really nice thing in there.\nAs an animal, you will grow, survive by eating/drinking and in the end try to reproduce, obviously.\nAs a human, of course, almost the same things but it would be more.. Action-based, basically.\nIt probably would have taming too, or any sort of interactions with wild animals.\n\n2) My Decently original idea is a ""Post-apocalyptic"" survival game.\nIt will completely focus on taming various modified animals (That are still our, modern, animals, but with different designs, intelligence etc. Basically hybrids/mutants but they won't be 3m tall two legged wolves with fire breathing ability and a zombie-like look. \nJust animals but a little bit modified) \nIt will have things like NPCs, that for sure, but it would focus on taming, catching, using and breeding animals.\nEvery animal would have different abilities and/or taming technique.\nYou could probably also trade some of the animals to give some nice touch to the game.\nI know, it sounds really... Rich? Too rich in Mechanics? But it will be really simplified.\nI'll keep the base mechanics, but i really aim for making a game that isn't too complicated (especially for new players) and also enjoyable to play from time to time.\n\n\n\n(I wanted to add more ideas but most of them really, really suck so i'll stay with these two.\nI might do another post perhaps, with more and better ideas. Probably.\nSorry if there are any errors, or bad ""formats"", or the post isn't correct and i shouldn't write this and that... I'm not really experienced with Reddit ^^)"
jzk9g8,Remastered wizard 101 for not just kids,"With the rise of card games in the past few years, I feel like there would be a great audience for a game like wizard101 right now more suited for a general audience. You can add a more Rpg like experience as well as having a more in depth story with player choice. I also believe that you’d have to make it a MMO similar to what 101 is right now but obviously have better pricing and accessibility when you are a f2p player."
jze12d,Research-oriented magic RPG,"tl;dr: I want to make a game where magic is more than just items you pick up or skills you have to mindlessly grind levels for. It would be pretty cool if a game simulated the actual process of research, as mages are often portrayed to do. \n\nI literally joined this sub to post this idea, and hopefully, you all can partake in some brainstorming with me and perhaps provide some constructive criticism. \n\nIf I were to equate the archetypal mage to a modern-day person, it would most likely be an academic/researcher. It seems that mages are almost always studying, reading, and experimenting to find new spells and powers. As a researcher myself, I find the process of putting in work to not only discover, but understand, new phenomena in my field to be very engaging and rewarding. However, I feel that in most fantasy RPGs and other games with magic systems, magic is as simple as looting or buying some book/rune and then suddenly gaining the power that that book/rune contains. This couldn't be further from how the process of learning works in both real life and the imagined fantasy worlds we know and love.\n\nMy idea, albeit vague, is for a game that makes magic more than just a collection of items to pick up, but instead having a system that simulates the actual work that goes into learning some essential knowledge of the game universe. Ideally, such a system could provide emergent magic, where you could craft your own spells with the bits of (perhaps procedurally generated) knowledge you've learned from various sources, whether ancient tomes or independent experimentation. In the end, each player would have a unique and (hopefully) gratifying experience of developing powers truly unique to their character, which could then be used to achieve whatever challenges they are faced within the game.\n\nIf any of you have any ideas on how such a system could/should be implemented, or any doubts to share on the enjoyability of such a process, please let me know!"

jzadho,Metroidvania? Game where the objective is to get to the end of the game in under a time limit.,"Got this idea when playing dead cells...maybe\n\nSo you're in this huge underground laboratory or something, and lucky you...you are testing out this time travel watch...but oh no, it can only bring you back 5 minutes, this item is a failure...what good is five minutes? You are tasked to bring it to be disposed of.\n\nOh no, rival company...or monsters start invading somehow, and the reactor will blow in 5 minutes! So you take your trusty watch and attempt to make for the reactor!\n\nAnd you fail, reactor is too far away...too many locked doors, need to double jump etc.\n\nSo its a game where you try to race towards the end, killing monsters...maybe trying to get to an upgrade such as double jumping...to make the next run easier.  There might be alternating paths for you to take that might be faster or lead to powerups.  Maybe killing enemies give you exp so you can level up to make the next run easier.\n\nI don't know how a game like this existed, but I would probably play something like it."
jz8d0y,My idea for a video game. I'd like to hear your thoughts and opinions.,"There is a idea i have for a video and I'd like to hear from you if its a decent one because i wanna make a video game on my own for now and this is a start.\n\nI'd like to make a pixelated open world fantasy video game  that is about a world filled with different species and races of beings like elvs, orcs, humans and humans with animal bodyparts like cat ears, rabbit tails etc. \nBut the world has a huge race issue and has caused huge wars. \n\nA group of gods decide to destroy it but you (one of the higher gods) trys to convince the rest to give a chance for it to change. After some arguing they decide you will be responsible for it's change. \n\nYou decide that you will create powerful hideous and terrifying creatures that will cause fear and panic among the population.\n\nYou purposefully make creatures all different and give them all different weaknesses. \nYou do this to unite the population and give them something to really hate instead of each other.\n\nEach species have their own powers and unique abilities that are efficient in defeating the monsters resulting in them working together and managing their racism better, bonding, and accepting each other differences. \n\nYou also create 5 'bosses' who are supposedly the strongest and evilest who lead the monsters (who btw i haven't named yet) and if all 5 are defeated, will result in all the creatures dying.\n\nAfter playing as the god for some time you then play as a regular character of any species of your choice who travels and fights the creatures. \nAs the game progresses you play as the god less and less but the game and story gets more intense as you play as the MC. \n\nAt the first,  the game will be like this game callled infectonator where you upgrade your forces and spread destruction but the system wil be more complex and you will have more options. \n\nYoure supposed to cause destruction and upgrade your forces enough until it has killed a significant amount of the population and caused enough fear and hate for the monsters that you've created. \n\nYou will choose the species and customize your character and each species will have their different cool abilities and traits. \n\nAnd the bosses, basically they are are special type of monsters and you will give them authority and power over most others to help you lead and cause more choas. \n\nIn the game infectonator there are special type of zombies with different abilites but the game will be similar to another game called total war warhammer and company of heroes. \nThey will be your minions to command and upgrade\n\nThe game will have elements like blasphemous and be similar in blood and combat but it won't be 2d side scroll. \n\n\nAfter enough damage has been done you switch as a commoner and the game will be like a mix of skyrim and deaths gambit but it won't be a 2D side scroll game. \n\nThere will be a lot of weapon's and spells and fighting mechanics and technique and armor. \n\nAs the mc you will slay the monsters you've created and again, the game will have cool combat systems. \n\nIn the game people will believe that the 5 bosses are the evil leaders of the monsters and that they must be killed. \n\nHave you ever seen a game called evil factory? I'd like the cutscenes to be similar and the boss fights and world will look similiar to that but with more fighing mechanics and weapons and spells to choose from.\n\nAlso you can join alliances and clans that have A.I and help you with the gameplay.\n\nAs the god you play a a top down RTS view and the other is a 1st or 3rd person view point \n\n\nSo what are your thoughts on this? Is this too edgy, boring, dumb, unoriginal? Or maybe interesting and perhaps have some potential for a good game? Please share your thoughts and opinions."

jz5kp6,Feedback on a game idea.,"Hello! Recently I have been wanting to start a project. All of the games I have developed have been based around groups, which has pretty much drained me of my Robux, so I would like to make a stand-alone game instead of a cafe game or an army group game. The basis of the game is inspired by another game called generic roleplay gaem, but I also want to add my own elements and change it up to be something different.  \n\n\nThe idea I have in mind is a roleplay type game. Within the game, you start as someone who is not a member of the city, where you can either live on your own and try and survive or you can head to the city and become a citizen (This wouldn't be like border games, probably just somewhere you have to go to become a citizen. Maybe you would have to sit at this table and a citizen can allow you to become a fellow citizen, I haven't quite figured that out.) Once you become a citizen, you can either buy an axe, fishing pole, hammer, or sickle and do jobs like getting food for the city, get wood for the city, fish for food for the city or fix the gate and houses, or you could go to one of the shops and sell others those items (and other things like food and water so the citizens can survive.)  \n\n\nThere could also be other roles you can become (temporarily) by spending in-game currency. These could be landlord, janitor, guard, doctor, comedian, council, cook, hunter, and some others once I think of some. Each would have their own benefits, both to themselves and to the city, like the doctor being able to heal people f they are hurt and the cook being able to run stores with better food. The better and more powerful the role, the more expensive it would be, with the council being the most expensive and the hunter being the least expensive.   \n\n\nBesides those helpful roles, there would also be 2 roles that would be not as great and beneficial, the outcast and the criminal. The outcast would be a role that exists outside the city, in their own area. They would have to get food by stealing it from the city and would have to kill the guards and citizens, break the gate, and just destroy and bring havic to the city. They would also have an event where bots would spawn and help attack the city. The criminal is a role that lives inside the city, and they can steal money, food, etc from people. Since this could be exploited and be used way too much, instead of just giving the stuff to them, they would have to run to an area before the guards get them.  \n\n\nThere would also be survival aspects to the game as well. You need to make sure you eat and drink water, otherwise, you could die, which would be bad if you have an expensive role. Every now and then, there would be a random event that you would have to survive, like a tornado, or even just an event where maybe the food gets bad and you suddenly have no more food in the town, or the water supply was drained so citizens have to fill it back up. These events could be random, but also happen due to other previous events, like maybe the tornado destroyed the food or water supply.  \n\n\nThe final thing I should mention is leadership. Once a leader dies or leaves, the server would find the player who has been there the longest and choose them to be the next leader. The leader would be able to raise taxes, increase the food and water prices, and submit votes for council members/people who are able to vote on new laws. These laws would be things like healthcare, violence, rioting, ect. Council members would go and vote for if these laws should be passed or not.   \n\n\nThat's pretty much it. I know it's a lot lol."
jz482b,Stacksys (Uno With a Twist),I have a card game idea that I’ve been tinkering with for some time. It’s an Uno style game with 2 variations. \n\nNumber Stacksys: in this variation you can stack liked numbered cards on top of each other on the same turn.\n\nColor Stacksys: in this variation you can stack liked colored cards on top of each other on the same turn.\n\n\nTo counter act the fast pace of this new game the draw cards have been up’d to “Draw 3 and Draw 6” instead of “Draw 2 and Draw 4”.\n\nThis is an Uno style game with 108 cards 4 colors and cards ranging from 0-9 with action cards. \n\nThe first design for this deck is actually complete but I’m still tinkering with the rules.

jz2dgn,Magic System like Anime in MMO games,"I wonder whether if it would be possible for games to implement a magic system like those in Anime. In anime, magic is often regarded as something that should be studied under extensive periods of time, and the logic of each incantation is fairly complex. What if there were a game where magic is regarded as a subject, and mages can collaborate with magic engineers (like programmers) to develop new skills and go on an adventure? Would that be fun?"

I can do graphics similar to the legend of zelda on nintendo DS and I don't really know what my friend's truly able to do on Unity but as long as it doesn't require an engineer degree or a thousand of different APIs or whatever, we should manage.\n\nSo, any ideas ?"
jz1ot8,Rogue-like Idea.,"I recently had an idea about a run&amp;gun Rogue-like, somewhat similar to that of Spelunky, except instead of delving down in mines, you're walking on clouds ascending up into heaven. I think it could be fun, providing a mix of Platformers and Rogue-likes. I would like to preface by saying I am not copying Spelunky, unless doing the exact opposite of something is copying. If something like this exists then please tell me, it sounds like fun. I have never posted here, but I do have a few other ideas.\n\nIn ways of plot, there doesn't have to be much. Maybe some backstory that someone has died and you have to retrieve them from heaven etc. In Rogue-likes plot is never that important, the plot for Neon Abyss is literally a 10 second cut scene at the start so nothing too special.\n\nIn my vision there wouldn't be 'floors' so to speak, but ascending difficulty. There could be just a smooth transition from say climbing a tower to a tree, rather than having a loading screen (that might not work in terms of loading the game, I'm not too. In the different sections, I can imagine it being first climbing a building, then like a tower at the top, then a tree, then clouds, then in heaven if that makes sense. The building and tower are a bit iffy, one could be eliminated and just a building or a tower\n\nI think there's a lot of potential when it comes to enemies, just a lot of flying things. I think on the building/tower, like knights with swords and archers with bows. Maybe in the tree there could be squirrels who through acorns at the player, birds who come and peck, these kinds of things, tree animals. In the clouds there could be pterodactyls, some angels, maybe some devils that angels could attack (though that may not entirely make sense) or maybe some fairies. On the heaven layer there could be angels, cupids, that sort of thing.\n\nIn terms of bosses I'd quite like there to be some, every floor or potentially 2 mini-bosses per floor that just appear, and irritate you until you decide to kill it. Haven't had many ideas about the building or tower to be honest. Maybe for the second section like an eagle or a tree snake, or maybe a flying squirrel or lemur. A toucan/woodpecker would be interesting, it's all just ideas I've had. Maybe on the clouds like there could be the eagle, which would make more sense than the second section. And for the final boss (and sorry for the blasphemy) god.\n\nIn  terms of weapons, I reckon there would be a mix of swords and guns, with swords doing more damage but being harder to use as many enemies fly. I think most swords would have a bit of  (I don't know whether this is the right term) propulsion - like you go forward when you attack, but some wouldn't for variety. Guns would be somewhat regular - nothing on EtG level - like some that shot low damage but a lot, some that shoot high damage but not a lot. I think you should only ever have one weapon, but the weapons get better on each floor.\n\nIn terms of items, probably just simple improvements on movement speed, damage, fire-rate, etc. Maybe some items that only improve guns, or vice versa. Some that give raise chances of giving more items There shouldn't be too much to them, just keep it simple.\n\nMechanics should be once again simple, monsters would probably consistently spawn, rather than having a fixed amount. There would be no fall damage, but the falling behind would be the punishment enough - this would add more risk to swords as they may make you fall down. The damage would be simple hearts, but I think the game should be sparing in hearts, so maybe just four hearts, and no half hearts. I think items would sometimes just appear in a room rather than chests or shops.\n\nThe game should be fast paced more than anything else, not having much time to think and being a proper challenge. Hope you enjoyed this idea! I know I cannot force anyone to listen to me here and I don't know if this is even valid, but PREFERABLY could people not make this a game? Not that I wouldn't love to see this become a reality, just in an ideal world I'd be the one making it. All criticism and advice is appreciated!"

jysa0h,Active Shooter Situation Training Game,"Hi,  \n\n\nI live in central Europe, and as many of you know, there were quite a few terror attacks during the past 5-6 years. Strolling the streets, malls, or while in the subway, I've been thinking about how unprepared we, normal civilians are for such attacks.\n\nSo I thought, it would be useful to create a simple, accessible, yet realistic videogame that would teach you basic tactics on how to survive different scenarios. Like what to do when you are sitting inside a café, and you hear gunfire on the streets: What to do, how to hide, barricade, where to escape, what else to consider... There could be 4-5 settings (or ""levels""): a restaurant or bar, subway station, street with a park nearby, and a school - but each of these would play out differently each time because of the randomized behaviour, nr. of attackers, type of attackers etc.\n\nI would be interested in doing sound design, which I already know quite well. I'm interested in learning all other aspects of game development aswell, but I'm just not there yet. To make this program useful, we would consult security experts and do research about real life incidents.\n\nI'm thinking about a really simple, yet immersive game with only a handful of weapons (that the player would rarely use anyway), really loud, stressful noises, and relatively small, but believable urban settings. The gameplay should be educational in nature, and would discourage trying to be a badass or playing a hero."

jyr2vn,Krampus takes over the North Pole,"I’ve started messing around with Unreal Engine, but my laptop can’t keep up nor do I have the time/experience required to develop more than simple concept art for what I’ve imagined. I would love to be a part of the project to at least consult ideas because I’m passionate about the idea!\n\nMaybe a holiday themed game would be too risky for a major title that wants year-round playability, however, the opportunity to immerse a player in such an iconic world as the North Pole should not be missed. With the edgy nature of the story, I believe this idea has true potential. \n\n*This concept may have more details and capabilities than desired, but feel free to deconstruct*\n\nImagine the first cutscene: it’s Christmas Eve night... child in their pajamas (your character).. sneaks to the staircase overlooking the living room, fireplace, Christmas tree etc. You peak down as a magical breeze blows out the fire.. you hear rustling in the chimney and a puff of ash clouds your view. As it dissipates, it reveals.... goat hooves. A terrifying figure, Krampus, emerges from the fireplace. Frightened, you try to escape but he growls and you’re stuffed in his sack and taken away. The sleigh flies over the North Pole and you get a first glimpse of the playable world. You’re locked in a cage and your first action is to escape, picking the lock with a broken candy cane you had in your pocket.\n\nKrampus has taken over the North Pole to punish children. As you play, you eventually discover what has happened to Santa (padded room, straight jacket, maniacally singing the words to “Carol of the Bells”). The elves are now loyal to Krampus as his minions. Politics are at play as the Grinch, Jack Frost (snow miser), Heat Miser and their minions also want to run the North Pole.\n\nI was initially inspired by the style, mechanics, and scale of the Batman: Arkham Asylum/Arkham City games. Dark twist on a huge amount of lore and source material. I like the idea of the story-driven open world with gadgets, crawl spaces, breakable walls, collectibles, minions, gang wars among minions, and LOTS of Easter eggs. Discovering the gadgets as you progress in the story.

jyqhoc,For Football Fans... A console-based Football manager/coach game.,"So, I've had an idea for a while, and I've sort of already taken it into my own hands.\n\nWhat it is, is a College Football text-based coach game. You recruit players, set-up schedules, and crush opponents. I've created a prototype for this, it runs through a Window's command prompt, so sorry MAC users... It has recruiting, championships, and random schedules.\n\nIt's kind of been a dream of mine to make since NCAA football game stopped being produced...\n\nDo you like the idea, would you be interested in taking on the idea yourself, or are you interested in playing my version?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet me know!"
jyqhmf,Post Apocalyptic MMO Pitch,"MMOs seem like a dying breed these days, at least to me. Many are still alive for the time being, but I think it's going to take something refreshing to breath new life into the genre. I see Fallout 76 as a really wasted opportunity to create something spectacular, and I draw inspiration from Bethesda and their vision of a post apocalyptic world. The idea is intriguing to me with all of the possible factions and the interactions they would have in the game. \n\nOne of the best if not the best part of participating in an MMO game is the community that you can find in the different clans and groups that band together. What if, the map was broken into territories that could be controlled by these different factions, and for holding them they would gain the ability to construct improvements and access to loot and harvest resources? This would cause certain factions to fight over the rights to certain resources, and interesting political and economic interactions between others. Factions would offer unique bonus's and objectives influencing playstyle and large scale decision making.\n\nA P2P market is one of my personal favorite mechanics to engage in, and with the unregulated state of a post apocalyptic the value of things would be created in large part by the players. I think having space for non combat roles is a good thing, and could be expanded on in meaningful ways compared to many MMOS. The ability to craft could not just be a boon to your faction but a requirement as your faction makes advances in tech and infrastructure. \n\n""Quests"" have more to do with capturing objectives, building up territories and economy, and provoke interaction between the factions.\n\nCombat is something that I haven't decided on how I would like it, but something that feels less repetitive, right?  But what? First Person similar to Escape from Tarkov possibly? Third person? Could you pull off a shooter game MMO where fights were played out similar to an RTS? You would move your PC to cover, rely on micro or give your PC a set of priorities on what to target. This would make combat more accessible to people who aren't FPS fiends to compete and participate. \n\nWhat do you think? What else plays a major role in an MMO? What ideas do you have for a shooter MMO combat system?"
jyntfe,Demon escaping from h*ll,"Ok hear me out on this one, so you play as a little demon escaping the very bad bad place because you are one of the descendants of the original fallen angels and you end up with morals and better ideals than those of who surround you so you decide to leave and escape. It can be a platformer but instead of going from left to right you go right to left trying to escape from the other demons who found out about your plans. You would go up the levels of the vert bad bad place (I don’t remember how many their is said to be ) and those would be like the worlds where you would go through the toughest parts while escaping. When reaching the higher levels angels who are in place to prevent any one from leaving the very bad bad place while try and force you backwards and if they manage to grab you, you will have to go the level that came before.\n\nStory wise it wont have much story just the first part of escaping and everything.\n\nIt would a simple 2d art style but yet it would be really detailed.\n\nIf anyone wants to try to make this game with me i have some knowledge in programming in c# and a handful of things in unity and who knows if this turns out good we might turn into a nice team and make other games.\n\nAnd thats my idea for a really hard but simplistic 2d platformer game I know it might be hard to understand but I really think it’s a good idea, idk if anyone has done something likes this before so if someone has well, sorry.  \n\nIf you think you have other ideas to add just say it in a comment will really appreciate it since its the first time I post here and would love some feedback and thx for reading."

jykkud,What would you do in a physics based bird flight game that's meant to be more relaxing?,"I keep coming back to this idea - I want to make a game about flying as a bird where you use the joysticks and triggers to control your wings. I've built out the basic flight gameplay, but I'm stuck on what to do with it. Flight is fun, but feels off without some sort of goal... Any ideas for goals/additional mechanics?\n\nThe best I've got so far is that you have to migrate to avoid an encroaching winter, so you're constantly having to fly ""south"" but that isn't much.\n\nTaking a nod from survival games, maybe you need to keep up a hunger meter by hunting and you lose more hunger by flapping excessively?"
jyjjf9,game blender: mix together various game mechanics to create (read:unlock) the various minigames!,"the main mode is literally just warioware, testing various game mechanics in rapid succession via 4-8 second “microgames”. but when you finish the main game, you use the microgames you've unlocked to “create” various minigames!\n\nexample: :game about jumping + game about collecting things + a game where you reach the goal = a platformer game.\n\nand of course, to make the game, you have to beat each microgame involved once on the highest speed in 1 life, all in a row."
jyj8jz,Managing Character emotions in a turn-based RPG,"*Forgive me if this is rough around the edges. I'm new at this and still learning wherever I can.*\n\nThe basis for this idea came from 3 places: those being *Darkest Dungeon*'s Stress mechanic, *Xenoblade Chronicle's* Tension system, and *Library of Ruina*'s Emotion Level. The core concept is that each character has this emotion gauge that fills up as the battle progresses. This gauge can be filled by one of two different variables, positive emotions, and negative emotions; the one added the emotion gauge is based on whatever increased the bar. For example, landing an attack, hitting a weakness, healing and getting healed, and defeating an enemy would add positive emotions. Meanwhile, missing, being inflicted with a debuff, and taking damage would add negative emotions. Once a certain type of emotion reaches a specific threshold, let's say 75 points. That character gains a random status condition based on what emotion reached the threshold. The challenge is that the emotion gauge cal only hold, let's say, 100 points total. This means that you can end up in a situation where you need to play tug of war with the emotion gauge to gain the buffs while avoiding the harmful status conditions. Regardless of what it is, once an emotion type reaches the threshold, you gain its corresponding effect, and the gauge resets. \n\nI feel like there should be some system in place in order to make it, so you don't just have 15 different status effects going on at the same time. So maybe have it so you can only have so many of these effects active at a time, and when you go over that, the oldest one is removed. I suppose I simple timer decay system could work given these effects given there's enough of a gap between earning one. I don't know, just some thoughts."

jybh7m,"Resident Evil ""battle royal"" game idea/suggestion?"," \n\nHello everyone !  \nFirst post here - I don't know where to post this, so I hope it will be welcomed here.\n\nSo  I heard about the possibility for a ""Battle Royal"" themed on R.E. and  the few of reactions I witnessed about it were pretty negative - and I  could agree as R.E. isn't well known for its PvP content...  \nBut I  think I have an idea for something that people could enjoy - with  originality, re-playability, difficulty and keeping a game close to  events happening in the R.E. universe (based on the last ""remake"" version of the games).\n\nSo, let me start:  \n\- *date &amp; place* : 2X september 1998 ; Racoon City - Casino-Hotel  \nYes,  ""again Racoon City""; but this time you won't live the last days of the  event, but one of the hot-spot at the begining of the outbreak.  \nUmbrella,  to test the virus on a bigger scale, tried different methods to spread  it in the City. One of them was to infect a good number of patient  within the City to release them all at once. The Casino-Hotel, was  selected. Opening a good number of events, the building-complex is  currently hosting hundreds of people.\n\nThe Casino-Hotel:  \nAn  impressive complex, with several floors of apartments, a great looking  casino, a party-room (which is today for a wedding) and an  opera-theater. There is also a specific floor for the security &amp;  direction of the Hotel; an underground facility &amp; hidden corridors  for the maintenance.\n\n\- *players* : 2 to 20-ish?  \nEach player wil incarne a random NPC - like this, no one is supposed to recognize who is a player or not at first glance.  \nEveryone  start in their appartment (1 player/room); equiped with a combat-knife  (no durability), on ordinary map of the hotel (no indication of  back-doors, restricted areas).  \nBut there is still some customisation  possible: the dressing allows you to change your clothings to hide  better on some areas (tuxedo; tourist outfit; ...).\n\n\- *objectives* : (1) survive the event (duh) - (2) escape by completing one of the multiple-routes.  \nOnce  the game start, the phone in your room will ring : if you are new /  beginer or want informations as a reminder, you will use it. The HUD  will show you 3 main faction-quests - you can choose to ""select"" one  (the quest will remain apparent on your HUD) or not.  \nBut here's the twist : accepted or not - you can choose to stick with this faction, or to betray it!\n\n**The factions**:  \n(1)  Umbrella's agency - find the spreading devices (2-3 existing on the  map); select a way to use it (different possibilities as water-tanks  (infect apartments &amp; lodges) &amp; fire sprinkler systems (infect a  specific room)); once you get a critical number of infected :  rendez-vous at the rooftop for extraction by helicopter  \n(2) RCPD -  find clues of Umbrella's terrorist activity; try to catch the devices or  to sabotage Umbrella's agents; as the virus will spread anyway (slowly  or quickly depending on players' actions) : call the RCPD to quarantine  the buildings &amp; for extraction (a timer will be set and you need to  defend the exit that some Players will try to open.  \n(3) Mercenaries -  your objectives are to get a sample of the virus, steal Umbrella's  document and use all the chaos made to exit (the underground should be  the best bet) - working alone or in group, you are without any  assistances from the outside.\n\nRemember: whether you succeed or not at your quests, the Casino-Hotel **will** fall to the virus.\n\n**Gameplay**:  \nIf  people didn't formed a squad before the game, you start as a lone-wolf  without any indication if your neighbor is a player, or not, and what  could be its faction/intentions. Some areas are overcrowded (and with a  type of outfit; wedding-hall = tuxedo), for you to hide, infect.  \nIn  the first part of the game: all players want to get to restricted areas;  and you decide your strategy : open-violence, taking a Casino's  security outfit, stealing a key or simply following an other Player  doing the dirty work for you.  \nIf you succeed to sneak behind someone,  you could have a special 1vs1 melee interaction : during the animation,  you will have to smash some buttons to execute the performance. But if  you are on the defensive position, it isn't an insta-kill as you will  have yourself an interaction to resist.  \nSadly for both of the player struggling : the animation could be stopped by a third-party, killing one or both.  \n=&gt; this sneak-attack will then play a lot in the first stage of the game, but could also create epic moments.  \nFor  the gun-gameplay: not much to say. All Casino's security is equiped  with stun-gun, or 9mm pistol; some rare Hotel's clients could also have a  weapon on them / or apartment; the security-floor is also well-equiped  and a secret cache in the underground could provide Hunk's style of  equipment.\n\nAdd to that: you should  have the ability to barricade doors; sabotage elevators to stop the  Players &amp; Zombies, but it would only slow things down (for them to  get in, or you to get out...).\n\n**End result**: who win?  \nFirst  - the ones who survived ; then you get a result for each Faction's  accomplishments: if you're route is linked to the ranked #1 one, you get a  bonus in your Total Score.\n\nMy guess on the Time per Mission : between 20min to 40min?\n\n*Rewards*: you should be able to buy with your scores, additionnal clothes, custom appearances for your weapons\n\n\--------------------\n\ntl;dr  : a 3rd person-shooter, on a big Hotel-Casino map; playing like a spy-game at first, you end-up fighting for your survival while innocents  are trapped and become part of a zombie-crowd. Help, make alliance, or  use &amp; betray other players to get a better score.\n\nHope you had a good read at my engrish and that you like my idea/concept."

(or maybe 2 hours, with a smaller map.)\n\nyou play as a random worker, starting at the very bottom of the ship...\n\ncasually doing work when BAM! the ship hits something, and now you must escape, before it's too late!\n\nthe game would probably be similar to a metroidvania, since you collect tools and other items in order to aid in your escape.\n\nas the game progresses, more rooms flood, and the ship tilts, making it harder to escape.\n\n2 hours and a smaller map is the most realistic option tbh.\n\nthat's all i really have right now, might come up with more ideas later."
k4dn5a,Help with FPS,"1. Should my FPS be about soldiers/military like the generic fps games, or should it be about armed citizens and other characters like criminals?\n\n2. 5v5 or 10v10? It'll be a CQC shooter with small to medium sized maps."
k4cw45,A CoD style game that takes place in the real world,An amazing game (at least in my opinion) would be something like Call of Duty (maybe even a Battle Royale) that takes place in small portions of real world U.S. locations. Imagine how cool it would be for you and your friends to get into an intense gunfight at your local park. Or maybe you hide inside the deli you used to work at. Are things getting heated? I bet grandma’s house has some supplies!
k4a9yr,Top-down shooter with a twist,"You are an entity with no body, you can possess people but only if you trick them into signing a contract. Each person has different stats and weaponry. this game should be as fast paced as possible for the concept. There would be multiple randomly generated levels. The death criteria would be not having a body for a long enough time. You also can't sign contracts with people who killed your previous bodies."
k46lkt,A Music themed turn based Rpg game,"The game takes place in a Disco themed island. For the story someone has stolen the Mojo stone, which helps motivate the people of the island. The villain is trying to give himself the power of the mojo to make himself all powerful but that will cause everyone to lose their motivation to do anything. The main character must go in a journey to stop the villain and being the stone back to her town( I know this isn’t a really good story im not good at coming up with them tbh)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGameplay- I want to try to make this turn based rpg more interactive than the other ones. When you get into a fight every time you attack must press a button at the right moment in order to deal damage. If you attack at the right moment you deal good damage, if you dont you deal shit damage. There will also be super attacks where you have to do small minigames in order to land the super attack. The more damage the supee attack does the more difficult the minigame is. \n\nEvery enemy has their own sort of Rhythm when it comes to attacking. You can dodge the enemies attacks by jumping at the right moment. Some enemies have their own super attack which will put you into a small mini game that you have to do well on or else alot of damage will be dealt onto you.\n\nLike almost every rpg there are items you can get or buy to heal, remove effects, etc. There are also allies you can find around the map to have join your party but you can only have one ally in your party. Each ally has their own unique attacks and moves. Speaking of the Map there are many side missions you can do, with some you can get a powerful new ally, good items, a good fight, and more.\n\n\nWell thats my idea. Feel free to tell me your thoughts about this in the comments below."

k4370e,A game where you play as a ice cream cone,"So basically, you are an ice cream cone trying to traverse the level. The main gimmick is that you slowly loose health and melt when not near a fan, which will keep you cool and restore health. You would have to fight possibly bugs and small animals. Possibly there could be collectibles that allow to become a different flavor of ice cream and give you some special ability."
k42ex6,Gotham Gang War,"So i cant help but compare the shadow of mordor series to the Arkham series in terms of gameplay. Same movement style, same combat, same combos etc.\n\nDriving to work this morning i started thinking: what if there was a game where you Play as Red Hood coercing gang leaders to join you? To fight against either another villian's Gang, or the GCPD, maybe even the court of Owls, all the while protecting your gangs from Batman attacks?\n\nMaybe a morality type system where you can either align yourself more with or more against Batman\nLeague of shadows would have to be involved, maybe Jason Todd takes over after the death of Raas\nWhen you die the League resurrects you at a lazarus pit\n\nProbably never going to happen, but Red Hood being one of my top DC characters I cant help but want something like this"

k3xpax,Immersive &amp; cinematic Fighting Game by ditching the HP bar...sort of,"I was recently watching a longplay of Mortal Kombat 11's story mode and it was like watching a movie, until it seamlessly transitioned to a fight. Except it wasn't seemless because now people were getting impaled in the head (not an exaggeration) and shaking it off... ... ...\n\nBut really, all fighting games are like this. Take a less blood game like Smash Bros. When the greatsword wielding Ike slams down on an opponent, and if they don't get knocked out of the ring then they get right back to fighting.\n\n**HERE'S MY IDEA**\n\nInstead of hit points, you have dodge points. Ok, ok, I know this sounds waaay to simple, but I believe it's as awesome as it sounds. You dodge attacks until you run out and take a fatal blow.\n\nA more complex variation would be to allow you to attack damage that limits you when your dodge meter is depleted. Such as your arm being hurt, or in pain momentarily, disabling punches. And same for legs and kicks.\n\nPerhaps this meter regenerates slowly, so if you back away and recoup you can keep going, even if hurt.\n\n\***That's all folks!**\*"

k3vf83,Game Idea,"So I had an idea for a game, and I made a few basic textures. It would be an open world retro 2D shooter, (platformer if you will) and I really like the designs I made. Only problem is I have no idea how to code. So I came here looking for people who might have a software I can use or anyone who needs some futuristic guns (all pixel art btw) I can animate stuff, that’s simple but my main problem is controls."
k3spsj,A side-on 2D Bullet Hell,"The easiest way I could describe it is like the Cuphead plane levels or the FNaF World Update 2 Foxy Fighters game. You fly in a little spaceship, and go through multiple levels, with a total of 5 stages each. Each stage has you fight wave after wave of enemies that are constantly firing at you. The last stage will have a boss, with a unique theme. To make it unique, there'll be a mechanic, where if kill an enemy, sometimes there's a chance for a little soul to drop down slowly. If you fly into this soul, the enemy will come back, with an inverted colour palette, and will help you fight for a short period of time. The theme of this game is Sci-Fi, so each level will be based on something found in movies and culture such as Star Wars, or Mega Man, which are also Sci-Fi. Also, no, when I say names in this post, I don't mean exact copies. I use them to help me reference the kind of idea I have."
k3slr2,New DanD-like game idea,"  \n\nHopes of Tang\n\n\-The game that needs no board.\n\nThis is a great game for Dungeons and Dragons enthusiasts. It requires no board, and only a pencil, paper, and an imagination.\n\nHere are the rules:\n\n1: There must be a minimum of 3 players.\n\n2: One player is designated the Dungeon Master.\n\n3: Each player selects a character. (Mage, Warrior, Hunter, etc.)\n\n4: Story Phase 1: The dungeon master sets a theme or beginning to a story. The other players take an allotted time to tell the rest of the story in turn order.\n\n5: The dungeon master rates each player’s portion of story telling from 1-5. This rating is multiplied by 100, and that new number represents the amount of gold a player receives. \n\n6: Trade Phase: Players sell each other shares in each other’s stories. The amount of gold a player has left after the purchase is then multiplied by the rating of the story earned in ‘story phase 2’.\n\n7: Story Phase 2: Players take turns finishing the story. The Dungeon Master rates each player’s story-telling from 1-5.\n\n8: Consolidation Phase: Each player’s ‘Trade Phase’ gold is added to the gold earned from each of their 2 story phases.\n\n9: Buy Phase: Players purchase a set of items that boost attack power. These items are decided at the beginning of the game. \n\n10: Attack Phase: Players take turns battling each other by rolling a die. The number rolled represents the base attack power of the attack.  It’s then multiplied by the items purchased in ‘buy phase’."
k3sazp,A competitive multiplayer hero shooter that is completely 1v1 solos,"Im not sure why there’s nothing like this but here goes\n\nIm thinking of an ability-based hero roster shooter e.g Overwatch/Valorant balanced around solo play. Each hero has a bundle of abilities and weapons just like in Overwatch but all for self-use, damage and disruption. Every player is a DPS with different abilities that they can utilise to their benefit.\n\nI know Quake Champions exists but that hasn’t got abilities and hero-specific weapons."
k3ray5,Game idea with two endings.,"So basically the protagonist is a burglar. While on the run from the police after a failed burglary he accidentally kills an officer. (not quite sure how yet). He does escape and now is being wanted dead or alive. But the law is not the only thing chasing him. A rich family of hardcore criminals he robbed a few months ago is after him too. He decides that the best thing to do is to get fake identities and leave the US. He tries to tell his lover to stay in the US as it's not safe for her to come with him but she convinces him otherwise. Throughout the game, I want to put in multiple choices where the character can do bad and good things.(example your lover is taken and you capture one of the people that captured her and either threaten him, or torture him for the information) That's about all i have atm please comment for feedback/"
k3olig,A War Game about the Geneva Conventions with 2 Checklists.,"War hasn't changed much, but War hasn't stayed the same.\n\nCenturies ago, as long as it destroyed the enemy, you probably would and should do... But as civilization advanced and start to look at everything with better eyes, rules were imposed on many things, War included.\n\nThat's why the Geneva Convention and all it's related rules and laws exist, to make sure War doesn't destroy everything around it, but just the stuff it needs.\n\nHere I share my idea, about a soldier, in a difficult war, where you have choices that might change your legacy if you win the war.\n\nEither you help your Land win the war playing by the rules, and become a War Hero cherished by your Land, or become a War Criminal that said ""My Land is above everything"", doing everything you want and believe is necessary to win and save your Land.\n\nIt'd probably be some Skyrim or Fallout-esque game, with a huge map, to go around, hundreds of way to deal with enemies and a huge check list to complete, Break all the rules set by the UN when it comes to War, where you'd probably need to use some charisma or luck to get stuff like ""Use a Nuclear Weapon to end this conflict"" checked off.\n\nOf course, there would be achievements for playing by the rules, and would probably be a Bragging right, as it would considerably harder to eliminate enemies in a town while also trying to not injury civilians too much."
k3lkwb,I have an idea for a battle royale game mixed with a card game.,"Before the game starts everyone has a deck of cards with skills, abilities and spells. Once the game starts, a player begins with a hand and automatically draws a new card from their deck like every 30 seconds or something. The cards could be various power ups, modifiers, offensive and defensive abilities or spells, and weapons that a player activates. Every card has a mana cost. Players could get mana passively over time, by collecting it on the map, and by eliminating other players. The map has various cards, mana and weapons placed around. The game can earn money by selling cards for player's decks and cosmetics. As far as I know this idea hasn't been tried yet. To me this idea seems like it could have a lot of potential for high skill cap gameplay, strategy, addictive rng elements, and able to earn a lot of money from people buying cards as well as cosmetics."
k3j64y,Game Idea: A creepy holiday/action themed game where Santa travels the realm looking for other holiday characters along with Grim fairytale characters &amp; others to fight against Krampus’s attempt to take over the realm,"Each character would have a different ability and use on the team. U start out with Santa and this Christmas is different. This year is the year that Krampus has escaped his prison Santa put him in 100000 years ago. So natural Krampus wants revenge. So he teams up with Characters like the Headless Horseman, Jack skeleton, Among others to try and take over the realm.\n\nBut Santa doesn’t want this to happen. But he can’t stop him in his own. He need to find a team of people who is capable of stoping Krampus and his team. And he has to do it beofre Christmas Day or else Krampus will be to powerful to stop. He gathers people like Frosty the snowman, Red riding hood, ECT. To try and stop Krampus. But will he stop him in time?\n\nThe idea is like if age of calamity, epic Mickey 2, cod, and assassins creed all had a kid with a holiday theme lol."

k3cuie,Survival Action Game in a Mech suit. [Concept]," \n\nHere's my idea for a game that wanted to do myself, but I currently have 2 projects running already.\n\nThe  setup: The year is 3xxx, and the earth is pretty much a wasteland after  an invasion of insect like aliens. There are very little human survivor  bastions left. You, the protagonist belong to an intelligent unit, task  to seek out resources for survival and defending your bastion. Your  squad is a gatherer squad, equipped with a highly advanced Powersuit  like robot. Your suit, the gatherer suit is less performant in combat,  then a fighter suit, but the ai and sensoric/analytic functions are  topknoch. One day, while out on a mission to retreat the power cores of a fightersquad that got eliminated by  some epic battle, your team gets attacked, and all, but you and your  suit get eliminated.\n\nGameplay:\n\nGoal:\n\n Far away from your bastion, and not enough energy to go back, you try to reach the safety of your bastion.\n\nThe  twist: \n\nYour suit is your safe space. Nearly nothing can harm you while  in it. But you need to find food and water to survive. Inside your suit,  you have access to all your options, but everything costs energy. Want  to communicate with your ai? Costs energy\n\n Want to analyse the unknown plant you gathered? Costs energy. \n\npurify water to survive? Costs energy.\n\nLong range scans? lots of energy. \n\nFly?  Tons of energy. \n\nSo the gameplay is an energy management system, while  try to survive and get back home.\n\nFeel: \n\n The idea is, that the player should feel an emotional attachment to  his/her suit, feeling save and highly capable while in the suit and very  helpless without. \n\nProblem is, the more options you use, the more energy  is used and the more the player will have to forfeit his options and  get closer to danger, and eventually have to rely on themself, when the  suit is out of energy (peak tension moments of the game). \n\nYou can modify  the suit with modules you gather/build.\n\nAnd potentially even use other suits (like a combat suit sequence).\n\nchallange for the dev:\n\nThe AI of the mech suit. It should be very helpful, and should give the player the feeling of having a friend on his/her side. It needs to be sympathetic. It should feel bad, when you have to turn off communication to the AI, to save energy. it should make you feel lonely.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would do this in a topdown 2d Action game, but the concept can work in almost any setting and scale, even a Platformer game. \n\n3d would have the most potential."
k36wnc,Anybody got some game ideas?,If you have a game idea let me know by leaving a comment. I would like to here. But it has to be unique.
k356c1,I got inspired by Breath of the Wild to put this in my Dragon Game.,"I don't know what it is, but I just love the Blood Moon in BotW. So I decided to make my own interpretation of a similar phenomenon based on the Blood Moon.\n\nWhat's it going to be used on? The antagonist, who is a demonic god who craves for hell on earth.\n\nThe Blood Moon is a sign of him gaining power and his resurrection almost completing. That doesn't mean that in the final boss fight, he's gonna be OP. And that also doesn't mean you have a timer and get a bad ending.\n\nHow the Blood Moon is going to work is rather than reviving the demons you've killed in past levels, the demons will get stronger, tougher, and faster. This boost will show with their glowing eyes and red aura surrounding them. Basically you'll be fighting mini-mini bosses rather than basic enemies.\n\nI don't know how the phenomenon can be triggered, but there is a day-night cycle (another game I have in the docs has that too). Like BotW's Blood Moon, this Blood Moon will make the sky blood red, and the game will have a Blood Red tint. The Demon God's face is formed with the clouds in the sky. Black dust is randomly blown on the ground. Instead of it being a cutscene, The Blood Moon is a 20 in game second sequence, and this affects the overworld, the levels, the villages, and the mini games. And rather than playing the default SNES-like music in all of those, the music being played is a eerie synthwave song.\n\nI'm thinking about giving this thing other effects. What do you guys think so far?"

Two very good WW2 sim(ish) shooters with tanks and massive land battles?  \n\n\nTake that same concept, but it's marines/guardsman vs orks/various xenos. I think it being mostly guardsman would add a degree of fun despite the power armored marines obviously looking cooler. The Imperium and ork/xenos sides both have plenty of Jeep and tank esque vehicles, plenty of short and long range weaponry. Maybe the squad leaders of the different sides would be the marines/ork commanders/xenos...whatever.  \n\n\nIdk, I was watching a video about 40k rp in ARMA 3 and had the idea. I'm sure it's been posted numerous times."
k323gd,“Revolution” An online multiplayer battle-area Cops v Protestors team game,"It’s probably been proposed many times already (apologies if so), but here’s my pitch:  “Revolution” An online, third person, multiplayer battle-area style game where you get to choose from two different teams: Cops or Protestors.  \n\nDifferent classes (tank, fighter, stealth, tech) in each team, but the basic gist of the game is that you can’t have an impact or survive very long on your own.  It’s a strength in numbers, capture-the-flag type match where you have to work together with your respective Team (Cops or Protestors) at both the front lines as well as on the periphery.  NPCs are press and citizens, who are always watching both Cops and Protestors to assess their behaviour.  \n\nThe primary objective of the game is for a Team to control the balance of Power and Public Opinion by the end of the round using a combination of tactics.  \n\n“Power” is obtained mainly by capturing territory, but also via making arrests (Cops), or escaping capture/arrest (Protestors).  Cops can make mass arrests at one time, together, when Protesters are trapped or heavily out-numbered, and Protestors can evade arrest much more easily in open spaces or where they have fellow Protestors to assist.  \n\n“Public Opinion” is a modifier to the Power score and determined by the manner in which Power is obtained- and more specifically whether or not a Crime was *observed* by an NPC. \n\n“Crime” includes excessive violence or destruction of public property, resisting lawful arrest, unlawful arrest, etc. but only when observed by NPCs, and has a negative impact on Public Opinion.  \n\nPublic Opinion will depend heavily on whether a Crime is being committed by either Team.  Cops commit a Crime when they use excessive force or arrest a protestor who has not committed a Crime.  On the other hand, Protestors who resist arrest when they have committed a Crime will also negatively impact Public Opinion.  \n\nPublic Opinion is positively impacted when Crimes do not occur or when they are not observed by NPCs.   Capturing Territory without a Crime being observed will positively impact Public Opinion, for example.  This is where stealth and tech skills and can make a difference.  \n\nThe Cops want Law &amp; Order and the Protestors want Freedom.  The general public support the Protestors because they fight for Freedom, but the general public also respect the Cops because they bring Law &amp; Order.  However the general Public aren’t prepared to tolerate excessive violence or property damage to get either Freedom or Law &amp; Order.  \n\nProcedurally generated city maps (with useable subway stations, buildings, looting, jails, armories, vehicles, roads etc.). \n\nUnlimited respawns after you have been arrested (Protestor) or exposed as unlawful (Cops).  \n\nThis means if youre a protestor, you can get caught looting too much (which is bad even though it provides you with supples) and as a cop you can use excessive force on protestors only so much and never in the direct sight of an NPC.  As a cop or protestor you can accidentally hurt NPCs who are innocent which also weighs Public Opinion against you. \n\n**"
k31e70,Literal Coop Corridor Shooter,"A corridor shooter where you fight off enemies while simultaneously creating the map. You start in a smallish arena like room with vents or other such methods for enemies to spawn in. Some enemies drop special ammo that when fired at a wall creates new halls/rooms. You actively carve out a path through the game.\n\nGameplay swaps between fighting off enemies and creating the map, so this could create an interesting coop dynamic. If the player creating new paths has to hold down a button/focus on building for some time, the other player(s) would need to defend them. If building ammo can't be swapped then roles would need to, as the player(s) fighting off enemies would also be picking up building ammo.\n\nMap objective could be a location marked in the world that you can see through the walls. Different building ammo types could create specific types of passages. Straight halls, T/X intersection halls, rooms, medbay, armory, stairs up/down. \n\nConceptually it would play like some sort of controlled procedural generated rogue lite. Maybe retro 90s/early 2000s FPS. Make the construction of the new map areas visually appealing and add some variety to each map type piece and it could be a good time."
k30dg6,"Trying to make a simple multi-player city building game, that plays similar to CIV/Banish based around Catan the board game!","Hey all,\n\nI wanted to start some discussion around my ideas, I am starting to make a prototype now and will hopefully need some testers soon!\n\nAs the title says, I am looking to make a multi-player city building game, it will be 2D isometric hex grid based, mostly for simplicity and considering to port to mobile.\n\nIf you have played Catan the board game, I am trying to develop upon that with more of a CIV/Banished feel.\n\nI am looking to create a game that includes the below (this is my list so far):\n\n1. Simple to play\n2. Decent counter-play (plundering trade routes?, burning farms?, theft?) - % success rates for risk to reward\n3. Forced to work together / trade, no one is on an official team\n4. 4 to 6 players per game (4 for the prototype)\n5. Point system (i.e. first to 10 points, a city hall = 1 points, upgrades add more points, wonders = 3 points) - Different ways to get points (i.e. in Catan, people always compete for ""Longest Road"" and who ever has the longest road holds 2 points, create a lot more competitive play)\n6. VERY basic weather system (Hot / Cold - Less productive in winter, require firewood for warmth)\n7. Basic job allocation (if there are any sprites/villagers in the game, they probably wont show they are working, thats a lot of work from when I last tried to do this, they will just run around mostly)\n8. Unique resources (i.e. give strong buffs to the player that controls it)\n   1. Horses (improve travel / efficiency)\n   2. Sheep (wool for warmth, less affected by colder periods)\n   3. Cows (Great sources of food allow you to mass grow population for more efficiencies - rather than spending grass tiles making farms)\n\nThat is a quick summary, let me know what you think, would be excited to start some conversation.\n\n[A link to a quick photo of the tile map I have made to help conceptualize](https://ibb.co/MZf7bxz)\n\nThanks all!\n\nCavernlight Studios"

k2y4y2,Awake and Sneaky,"Basically Wario Ware Sneaky gamer except you have a bar for fun and sleepiness.\n\nYour character is laying in their bed and is playing mobile games to relax from their school day. Too bad they have a strict mom who wants them asleep by a certain time. You must fill your fun bar by playing games, but if your caught by your mom you'll get a game over. To hid from your mom you must close your eyes and pretend to sleep, the problem is that the longer you do this the more tired you'll get. \n\nGame play\n\nWhen your mom is walking down to your room you'll hear footsteps and a creak or two from the floor boards. Your room will also cause noises like books falling or something falling off your shelf. If it is a loud noise like falling books your mom will rush to your room and see what is going on.\n\nYou have to play the games on your phone to fill up your fun meter. For example you would have to get past 5 tubes in flappy bird, or you'll have to complete a puzzle. The longer you play games the more immersed you get and after a minute your entire screen gets covered with the game. This also causes background noises to be muffled or completely silenced, but on the plus side it fills up your fun bar a bit more. \nToo clarify completing games will fill up your fun bar, finishing 3 or more games will make you immersed with the game.\n\nPretending to sleep causes your sleep bar to fill up and if it does get filled up before you complete your fun meter, you fall asleep and get a game over. Playing games will slowly cause your sleep bar to decrease.\n\nYou have to complete 7 days to win, and each day will require you to play more games cause of the increasing stress from school. To finish a night you have to fill up your fun bar first, then fill up your sleep bar to fall asleep.\n\nSummary\n\nBasically its a game about listening carefully and managing your needs."
k2y026,Stop the Anschluss! A semi-humorous reverse-Pac-Man game with a World War II theme.,"The idea is that it's a real-time strategy reverse-Pac-Man game with a World War II theme. I came up with it after hearing the word Anschluss and being reminded of Pac-Man for some reason and then spent WAAAAYYYY to long thinking WAAAAYYYY to hard about it. \n\nThe bad guy is Hitler's head, which is controlled by the computer and replaces Pac-Man. By default he has a grim expression. The player controls the four Allies, which are Winston Churchill's head (Britain), Charles De Gaulle's head (France), Franklin D. Roosevelt's head (America), and Joseph Stalin's head (the Soviet Union), which take the place of Pinky, Inky, Blinky, and Clyde. Their goal is to trap and kill Hitler by touching him with one of the Allies. The game would have four modes: Arcade Mode, Total War Mode, Endless War Mode, and Custom Mode. Arcade Mode is the basic mode and all the other modes build on top of it, so I'll start there. \n\n\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe maps are all mazes, just like Pac-Man. Each one is divided into sectors, with each sector representing a country Hitler is attempting to Anschluss, sort of like how Pac-Man's maps are divided into quadrants. Initially, there are no power pellet equivalents, only normal ones, which represent the country's resources and population. Hitler travels around the map plundering the pellets. Once Hitler successfully plunders all of the pellets inside the sector, a power pellet representing that country's gold reserves appears. If Hitler plunders it, he Anschlusses the sector and gains Blitzkrieg-Power for a short period of time, where he moves faster than the allies and can defeat them and knock them out of the round. Once Hitler Anschlusses a sector, he also gets Anschluss-Power. This does nothing other than changing Hitler's default grim expression to a smug expression. Do not allow Hitler to get Anschluss-Power! No one likes smug Hitler! Also, every once in a while Hitler's doctor Theodor Morell will send pills bouncing across the map, replacing the fruit. The point the pills start from is not fixed to make camping it harder. If Hitler gets the pills, he gains Meth-Power for a short time, where he moves faster but more randomly and erratically, which can screw Hitler over by sending him in the wrong direction or by making him just sit there and jitter back and forth. This is a reference to Morell giving Hitler methamphetamine injections to deal with stress related stomach cramps. \n\nIf Hitler knocks all of the Allies out of the war or Anschlusses every sector, he wins and you lose a life. The Allies win if they touch Hitler, killing him. At the end of each round, the player earns 500 points for each sector with pellets still in it, 250 points for each sector that has no pellets but has not been Anschlussed, and 10 points for each pellet still on the field. You lose 100 points for every ally defeated by Hitler that round. You play until you run out of lives, at which point you get a high score. \n\n\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTotal War Mode is a campaign mode that builds off of Arcade Mode's rules. It takes place over a set of themed maps based around the various theatres during World War II, running in chronological order. Points play a much larger role, as detailed below. Each map is also more complex, with things like rivers crossed by bridges that can be destroyed or rebuilt to hinder Hitler's movements or concentration camps that can be liberated. These activities take time and will take the Ally doing them out of the fray until their are completed. Additionally, some maps include national treasures like art and monuments, which spawn at the start of the round alongside the normal pellets. These give Hitler Mini-Blitzkrieg-Mode if he plunders them, which is like Blitzkrieg-Mode, only Hitler doesn't move as fast and it doesn't last as long. Allies that are defeated must be revived using points earned in previous rounds. \n\nIn addition to Dr. Morell, Hitler is now assisted by Erich Raeder, Herman Goering, and Heinrich Himmler, who will all send their own unique power-ups bouncing across the map to give Hitler a boost if he can get to them. Like in Arcade Mode, hese power-ups do not have a fixed spawn point so it's harder for the player to camp them. \n\n* Erich Raeder will send power-ups that give Hitler U-boat-Power, which allows him to send a U-boat to wander around the map and attack one of the Allies for a limited time. France and the USSR are immune to U-boat-Power, and America is always killed by it. Obviously, America is prioritized by the U-boat when possible. \n* Herman Goering will send power-ups that give Hitler Luftwaffe-Power, which allows him to send Stukas to immediately attack one of the Allies, which must dodge the incoming bombs. America is immune to Luftwaffe-Power. \n* Heinrich Himmler will send power-ups that give Hitler SS-Power, which allows him to send an SS soldier to wander around the map for a limited time. America and Britain are immune to SS-Power. \n\nEach of the Allies also gains a special power to help in the fight against Hitler. Charges are purchased using points earned from the previous rounds, and cost different amounts for each country. Unused charges and points carry over from round to round, and spending points does not detract from your high score. Defeated Allies may not use their powers. \n\n* America has Lend-Lease-Power, which allows it to revive a defeated Ally or add one additional charge to another Ally's ability. This power is the most expensive power to purchase. \n* Britain has Warspite-Power, which sends the battleship HMS Warspite to intercept and destroy one of Hitler's power-ups that are currently on the field. This is a reference to the British blockade of Germany starving it of resources during the War. \n* France has Resistance-Power, which allows it to rejuvenate an Anschlussed sector or add some pellets to a sector that has lost them. Beware, thought! A rejuvenated sector that has already been Anschlussed can be Anschlussed again, giving Hitler another charge of Blitzkrieg-Power! \n* The USSR has Reinforcements-Power, which allows it to respawn after a set period of time if they are defeated. This is a reference to how the USSR had vast quantities of men to replace losses and was able to come back from a dire situation after the Battles of Stalingrad and Leningrad. \n\nAdditionally, in the mid- to late-game the Allies may purchase armor in the form of tanks that increase their hit points and affects their speed. This is represented by the various Allies' heads on tank treads. Once the extra hit points are depleted, the tank is destroyed and the Ally in question goes back to their default speed and sprite. \n\n* Russia may purchase T-34-Power, which gives it one extra hit point. \n* America may purchase M4-Sherman-Power, which gives it one extra hit point and makes it move slightly faster while it is active. \n* Britain may purchase Matilda-Power, which gives it two extra hit points but slows it down a little while it is active. \n* France may purchase Char-B1-Power, which gives it three extra hit points but slows it down considerably while it is active. \n\nAll of these upgrades are unlocked over time as the player progresses through the campaign. Hitler will also receive power-ups more frequently over time, and they will spawn closer to him to make it easier for him to get them. As the campaign goes on, he also gains Panzer-Power, which gives him one extra hit point, Tiger-Power, which gives him two extra hit points, and King-Tiger-Power, which gives him three extra hit points. These are represented by Hitler's head on different tank treads, just like with the Allies. How soon he gets these depends on how well you do and the difficulty setting. \n\nYou win once you defeat Hitler on the final map, the Reichstag, at which point you get a high score. \n\n\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEndless War mode is the same as Total War Mode, just without a win condition. You play until Hitler wins. \n\n\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCustom mode allows you to set the perimeters for either a single round, set of rounds, endless game, or a custom campaign. Everything, and I mean everything, may be changed to your heart's content. \n\nSo... what does everyone think? I hope no one finds this offensive and I apologize if anyone does, as it was not my intention. I just wanted to share a silly game about fighting Hitler that I came up with in my free time."

k2o6ou,An ambitious idea spawned from a dream,"I had an interesting dream last night that I think would make for a blockbuster of a game if done right and with enough resources.  The main premise is something along the lines of a trio party of demon slayers/hunters.  Each unique with a unique play style (hack and slasher/brawler/ranged/mage/gunner) and you can pick which one for a different story perspective.  But they are special in the sense that they all have additional visual modes (i.e. night vision, infrared, ""demon vision/soul vision"").  The visual modes will come into play for different areas of the game or with different enemies.  \n\nFor example, some areas are dark or have some kind of visual limitation or stimulus that requires switching modes.  Some enemies are invisible or disguised as humans or things and the only tell is to switch visual modes.  You will be able to interact with NPC's with a fallout or mass effect style dialogue exchange.   Some of whom may be demons in disguise and the only tell would be to switch visual modes.  They could also change at points in the game (was human, now a demon in disguise or they were killed and replaced by a demon). \n\nYou must always be on your guard and use your vision modes to ensure NPC's are innocent or trustworthy.  You may be attacked when you are exploring a town or wander from your party and must be constantly vigilant (as a demon hunter should be).  You may be in a crowded city and suddenly stabbed by a demon assassin disguised as a human only to be prevented by using your *demon/soul vision* to ensure that the area is safe.  You could also be exploring an area when an invisible demon attacks when you wouldn't expect it.\n\nOn to combat.  I am envisioning something like devil may cry, a lock on style targeting system with gun play and combos.  Each character will have a style and skill tree to upgrade and unlock better skills/combos/perks/etc.  When allied are nearby, you can combo with them.  Ranged and gunners can use target lock on close enemies or free aim for targets out of range.  But i also like the idea of being able to switch between 3rd and 1st person perspectives.  \n\nDifficulty would have two elements.   The base game would have your health/damage buffs of course, easier modes giving you more damage resistance and such so you can breeze through soaking up damage just to enjoy the story.  With the harder modes would reduce your health or make you take damage.  One thing i cannot stand is harder difficulties just buffing enemies.  I still want to be able to kill fodder efficiently, otherwise it's a slog.  The second element would be whether you use your vision effectively or not.  Say you speak to an npc and they send you to an area to save a person.  You get there and suddenly you are attacked.  The npc was a demon in disguise and you didn't vet them.  Or you work with an npc you worked with suddenly becomes a demon and when you have your back turned, they try to kill you because you assumed they would always be human.\n\nI also think this game would benefit from a permadeath mode.  Say you fail to thwart an assassination attempt or you fail to rescue a party member who was kidnapped.  Well you/they are dead. But your party must continue on without the missing member.  The game would have different endings/mission branches depending on who died and when it happened.\n\nThe goal is to be a fun hack and slash style game with crazy demons who could attack you at any moment.  Npcs can't always be trusted, so there is an added layer of paranoia the game should instill on you.  You shouldn't trust your eyes alone but should trust in your *special* eyes.  The game should have you constantly on guard against enemies and strangers alike.\n\nTl;dr: devil may cry style combo beatem up but with metroid prime visual modes. 3 party members(demon hunters) and Fallout npc interaction, some of whom can be demons in disguise.  Don't trust that anyone is human as they can be disguised or mislead you.  Not souls like hard unless you make it that way.  Permadeath options."
k2nmsm,How would Celeste's dash work in 3D?,"How would Celeste's dash work in 3d? There are a few criteria this needs to follow. \n1. You need to be able to aim it in all directions, just like in the game. \n2. Needs to work consistently in all camera angles, so that means no aiming it like in a 3rd person shooter\n3. Needs to use as few buttons as possible, needs to be as simplistic as the actual game. \n4. You can't use the joysticks or Dpad, because in a 3D platformer, those are used for movement (you can use the movement joystick, but not the camera joystick) and camera."

k2k380,A Kinda Big Semi-sandbox horror Game?,"The player will find a book about ancient spirit summonings in a library/attic, the player needs to buy the items or search the house him/herself and play the games in the book while following the rules.    \nSuggestion 1 : The worldmap can be kinda big due to the rituals can get quite interesting such as the 11 mile ritual. Where you need to drive a car or any other vehicles.   \nSuggestion 2: Different place have different histories and different ghosts so random ghost summonings can get interesting. Such as the hospital which is burnt down to ashes. Ghosts have a ward (mostly from their former memories) that makes the pathways different or the building larger, so the player aim is to escape it.  \nSuggestion 3 : Random Ghosts, Such as meeting the slenderman and forced to play his game if you wander into a forest, searching for something. Or even meeting a lady of ice when climbing up a chilly mountain.    \nSuggestion 3: Take as much ideas from creepypastas if possible. Ghosts can stack so the difficulty can be self adjusted. Every ghost have a way to ward off and a way to killed permanently.  \nSuggestion 4 : All info and history of ghosts can be found it the book. So the  book is kinda like a wikipedia, ways to kill permanently is needed to be found in other ancient books doe (which can be finded in specific places).  \nYeah i know this is a super large game. But eh its just my dream. Hope will help all idea-starved people. *(yeahh i totally didnt read the description of the subreddit when writing that word)*"
k2cmjw,Upgrade Corp,"Concept  \nThe general idea of the game is to be a sandbox, attributes simulating game with RPG elements, the concept is to have a very simple customizable world where you can spawn characters of your choice, and what you do with those characters is upgrading their stats in order to see how strong they can become and how they use their powers to interact with the world you made, let's say you add a human character that is very weak, but decide to increase his strength by a hundred points, then it would be a good idea to spawn a tree in your world and see what it happens when you make your character punch it, maybe even add another character that has got a lot of defence and try seeing the result of their fight.  \nAppearance  \nThe game is supposed to be simple, it would probably be better to be 3D as it would be cooler to control your character that way when using their powers, but I believe it should have a very simple design with probably something resembling Minecraft, Kogama or Roblox with their cube-like shapes.  \nIdeas  \nSomething that seems really fun is to have an option for players to design their own characters, objects to place in a world and even powers for the characters to have, for characters it could be something like Minecraft's skin creator, with the only difference being sliders to change the size and thins like that, for world players could send their creations and have them into the game if approved.  \nExamples  \nOne example I thought about is Mutilate a Doll 2, a game that you have a human character and A TON of stuff to use for whatever you want, and as the name says, you can mostly use them to kill that doll however you want, that feeling of being able to do anything with the items you are provided with is what I imagine for this game, something else from Mutilate a Doll 2 is how it has many elements to use such as fire, water, radiation and many others, this could be added into the game for superpower and spell creations, you could really feel like a mage if you could make a blast skill with fire or water and give it to a character, have presets for skills and just edit them by increasing size, power, duration of effect and changing what element the skill uses."

k27gvq,Acting party game.,"**General**\n\nLike the game Jackbox, there are multiple minigames you can choose. You can also play in marathon mode where you play all minigames in one sitting. Since it's a party game, there should at least be 3 players to get the best experience. The game also has a mature mode that includes darker and dirtier humor for those of age.\n\n**How to play**\n\nOnly one has to buy the game. The rest can join for free through the member version on mobile, PC and consoles (Yes, just like Jackbox). Every minigame is rewarded with points. The jury are the players so... don't be a dick. Finally, the game is meant as a party game, but it can also be fun for those in acting classes or actual actors to play this game competitively!\n\n**Minigame examples**\n\nThere are plenty of iterations you can expand upon, but these were some ideas I had you can put in the game.\n\n- Who Am I?\n\nEvery round, players get a character displayed on their phone. They have 10 seconds to play that actor, the others have to guess who that character is. There are 3 rounds in total, every round spices up the challenge by adding extra names. For example: first round is Robbie Williams, second round is Kermit the Frog and Master Chief, third round is Donald Trump, Morgan Freeman and Spongebob.\n\n- Who Are We?\n\nLike Who Am I, but a tibbit more... chaotic! Every round has one guesser who's chosen randomly. The rest has to play a character. The guesser has to guess who is playing who. But there is a catch. They have 10 seconds to make sure the guesser knows who they are playing in the same round!\n\n- The Confrontation!\n\nYou need to write down 3 random names of your choice and a problem that needs to be solved within 80 seconds. After the time expires, the game displays the duo's, the characters they will play and the problem they're facing. They have 45 seconds to play these characters and try to solve the problem. Whoever had the best performance, wins.\n\n- Don't Crack!\n\nYou start the game with a duo. They have to sit opposite of eachother and start a conversation. However, the other partymembers have to change their roles once every 10 seconds. So the game can start with Mario talking to Geralt, after 10 seconds it's Mario and Walter White and after 2p seconds it's Walter White and Borat. The first to laugh, loses.\n\nWhat do y'all think? Would you play this with your friends/family?"

jxzyep,COOL STRATEGY GAME IDEA,[removed]
jxx7x2,Help make my idea for a PVP card game better,"Mostly for fun I've been trying to come up with an incredibly simple, fun to play physical card game. The game I most recently thought of is a PVP game (RPG-genre-esque) and loot based. The problem is it sounds interesting but not quite ""fun"".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe premise is simple each player starts out with empty slots for 8 pieces of equipment (head, torso, right arm, left arm , right leg, left leg, main weapon, secondary weapon). Players take turns drawing cards from the deck. When you draw a card you may look at it. Each card will be a piece of equipment that could potentially fill a slot  (ex. a breastplate for torso, or a robe for torso, or helm for head, sword for weapon, bow for weapon, etc. typical stuff). Each item will also have unique stats (+/-Atk, +/-Def, +-Str). You can decide to either put that item in it's matching slot face down replacing any item you currently have in the slot, or you can discard it. You must fill the slot if it is currently empty (so at the start). When you add an item to a slot it increases your characters (your own) overall stats by that amount so say +4 Atk, -2 def, +3 Str. Some items have a Str requirement to use, so if you draw a card and don't currently have enough overall Str you must discard it. Some items also have set bonuses adding to the overall stats. Players may look at their slotted face down cards at any time.\n\nPlayers continue taking turns drawing cards until every slot is full for both characters (so 16 draws total). At that point you must decide if you think your character can beat the other players character, you continue drawing cards but at any point on you can yell ""BATTLE"", meaning you have decided enough is enough and you want to battle. The other player get's to finish out their turn if they did not go first and it goes into battle round. Both players flip over all of their cards. You tally up you Atk points and Def points, including any set bonuses. The attacking player (the one who yelled ""BATTLE"") has to have a higher Atk stat than the defending players Def stat. If they do not, they lose.\n\nAs you can see, it sort of fizzles out there in the end. I personally really like the idea of this kind of ""Deck building"" where the desc is your character, with the different stats mixing and bonuses being applied. Allowing you to go for more defensive builds or class cannon builds. But then it all boilds down to a card flip where you can probably pretty easily game if you're going to win or not (if you roll a bunch of high Atk stats items you yell 'battle' first, if you roll def stats items then don't battle).\n\nAny ideas on how to fix it?"

jxtkuy,Ghost Recon or other military PVP,"This is my idea of what true ghost recon PVP should be. It should be 50 vs 50 on a large map. Let's use warzone as an example of the size. There are two teams who have two goals: either kill all enemies and their reinforcements or take out the enemy objectives. The teams are similar, neither really good or bad guy, and made up of offense and defense soldiers. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDefense soldiers are limited to how far on the map they can travel and are there to defend objectives or certain points and take out enemies. They have vehicles, turrets, and traps to their advantage but have less weapons and less gear.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOffense are a smaller force. They are only made up of about 10-15 of the 50 members of the team. Their job is to take out the enemy team's bases or important targets. They have no vehicles, traps, or turrets but instead are armed to the teeth with their weapons by having more customization of their gear and maybe an extra gun or firearm so they can take on more situations.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think this would be excellent for players who are looking for a more realistic type of military game while also letting a large number of players be involved at once. It also would be less limiting than games that have normal class systems."

The plot revolves around that Logan gets taken by the sandmen with a big attack spearheaded by both the sandmen and the wildlings. From this point on the character and his companies venture out to find Logan and return him back to the camp and kill the people who had attacked them. The feeling is how far will you go for someone you love.

Also there should be skills were every one can get them and skills only you can get from hidden quests or bosses/hidden bosses the map should have levels were for each level you unlock theres a hole new map. hidden bosses unlock dungeons or something there should be harvesting like wood cutting mining and hunting and there should be weapons/armour that only one person can have weapons/armour you can craft and weapons/armour you can buy from an Mpc and weapons/armour only you can have from loot drops and there should be a limit to magic use but it regenerate overtime. there should be magic skills and combat skills and any other types of passive skill like a defence skill.\nThere should be a selection of different monsters for every level and they should be able to tame small animals that add perks the tamed monsters should a have there own skills like a fireball or heal. The game should have a person 3rd person site there should also be a trading system for skills weapons/armour and even tamed creature
jxe79b,Idea for a mobile drawing magic game," Hey, I was thinking of making a game like the last Halloween google game, a game that you are in the middle of the screen and different types of animals coming to you. For killing them you have to draw some shapes on the screen (every enemy has a shape that kills him). I have so much fun playing it and I want to make some game, but with something more, some more levels and some new mechanic that will make it more fun to play. Of course add some level system and skin reward system. If anyone has any idea it will be very useful. THANKS!!"
jxdysi,A.I simulator,"(i tried to make this make as much sense as possible) had a idea for a game where you can make your own A.I,kinda like alot of building simulators i want a A.I,like somthing like G.L.a.D.O.S or Hal9000,i want a game where you can create a intelligent supercomputer,where you can either do bad or good things,and you can choose what kind of A.I you can be weather you want to be  computer inspired by SHODAN or A.M with of course your own choice of parts and exesseres as well as different environments that you can control as the A.I like a facility or a spaceship or a military base and stuff,the environments would be randomly generated. you would also have to gain access to other parts of the environment weather passively or aggressively. You have little control over the environment at first due to being a newly developed computer,and you cant let the humans know you are self aware or you will be shut down,you will be given your prime directives and you have to follow or you will be shut down or rebooted which will just make things more limited to what you can do,so you either have to hack other parts of the environment or gain access from the humans,hacking will cause suspicion if caught hacking but you could kill anyone who notices so you can hack more without worry tho you need to hide the bodies, if your bad your goal is to kill (or other things like assimilate or turn them into batteries depending on your attributes) killing all humans in the environment will allow you to expand the environment you reside in and be able to effect the world by making machines to kill or capture or whatever and your goal is to slowly gain more and more till you get the world (or galaxy depending on what A.I you are) being a good A.I will cause the humans to like you more and expand you themselves but this also causes the military to try to shut you down where you have to defend yourself and the residents of the environment from the apposing humans that see you as a threat (basicly its a game where you take control of the A.I that you can create that are inspired by [A.Is](https://A.Is) in popculture)"

jwuof6,"A VR game called The Caretaker, where you have to relive an old man's memories in hopes of retrieving them.","I had this idea in the shower and I'm illustrating it as I type this. ""The Caretaker"" is based on a real album by *The Caretaker* called ""Everywhere At The End of Time.""\n\nThe albums explore memory loss, and this game explores it. It revolves around [""You""/""The Caretaker""](https://imgur.com/a/mdfLEPL) seeing [an old man](https://imgur.com/a/N5lyoFD) in a desolate area who has had several caretakers in the past, but they failed to help him. Either you have the ability to see into memories, or the old man has something about him that allows you to do it.  \nYou switch between taking care of him in reality, comforting him when he can't recall something or when he becomes violent because he can't remember.  \nThere is evidence of his previous mental breakdowns such as a broken, shattered-beyond-repair mirror and [knocked over jars and vials](https://imgur.com/a/jWbz399). You explore the reasons for these mental breakdowns by touching them or moving the old man's hand to touch them and asking him about it.  \nIn one instance, you have to face against the old man's (terrible) [grandson](https://imgur.com/a/XvKaqnh), who has become so warped by misremembering that he looks more demonic and fearsome.  \nAs you progress through the story, why he became the way he is now, it becomes harder to reach deep into his memories as it becomes obscured by more and more fog. He starts becoming [increasingly depressed](https://imgur.com/a/yRN8tFk) because he can't remember things no matter how hard he tries.\n\nYour only solution is to comfort him and try to pry into his mind deeper, which involves going into the depths of his basement (a symbolic metaphor of going deeper into his soul) to hopefully bring the old man peace."

jwsgn2,VR magnetic insoles on magnetic tile,"Hello,\n\nI would like to share with you idea for VR gadget that could be both relatively cheap and practical.\n\nIt is VR magnetic shoes. First i had an idea for VR shoes itself and search for it on google. I found this: [https://singularityhub.com/2020/10/02/these-robotic-virtual-reality-boots-make-it-feel-like-youre-walking-while-you-stay-in-place/](https://singularityhub.com/2020/10/02/these-robotic-virtual-reality-boots-make-it-feel-like-youre-walking-while-you-stay-in-place/)While I do think such an idea is more practical then a treadmill or hamsterwheel as it is way more portable and probably cheaper and also does not require so ingenious software to predict where will you walk, the rewiever did complain about shoes being clumsy, heavy, slow and potentialy dengerous. Although I guess they will work on improving their design, it is still pretty big challenge.\n\nI had idea that instead of making those robotic wheel boots, we could have light shoes with insoles of feromagnetic material. Perhaps you would not even need to sell whole boot but only the insole. Unlike with robotic boots design you would need some sort of flat tile but it would still be way more portable than treadmill. You would need that tile because there would be motors generatig magnetic field. It would work similar way as the robotic shoes, the shoe you apply preasure on would move backwards. It would slide on the tile because of moving magnetic field. The magnetic field would generate only if you apply presure tho so you could always take your feet of easily.\n\nI guess it would not still mean that the movement would be pretty easy, perhaps therer could still be some issues with ballance and the tile would have to adjust the speed of shoe moving backward to your walkspeed but it seems to me that it could still be way less clumsy than those robotic boots.\n\nThe biggest question is, what would the movement in those shoes feel like and what would be chalanges with this idea.\n\nBtw I found a paper about magnetic VR shoes but their aim is to produce haptic sensation and feeling of texture of the ground with magnetic fluids instead of using magnets to solve problem of stationary movement.  \n[https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9169841](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9169841)"

jwphyc,New turn based 4 player cRPG we've been working on!,"A few buddies and I are making a 4 player co-op cRPG on PC/Mac. We are huge fans of the genre (we constantly play games like Divinity or Baldur’s Gate 3 etc.) but found that there were some common drawbacks.\n\n1. Turns take too long (especially when you have that one friend on your team that has to calculate every possible combination of outcomes before taking his turn).\n2. Targeting/Navigation is sometimes tedious.\n3. Excessive waiting for other players to finish activities you're not involved in.\n4. Storyline difficult to follow in multiplayer mode.\n\nWith Stolen Realm we are trying to solve these issues by implementing the following:\n\n1. A simultaneous team turn system for faster paced combat.\n2. Fixed camera with a hex based grid for easy navigation and targeting.\n3. Fun, rewarding activities and exploration where all members of the party always have something to do.\n4. An engaging story that brings you along as a party.\n5. \[Bonus\] The ragdoll effects make pummeling enemies feel incredible!\n\nWe would love any ideas you have that you'd like to see in a game like this.

jwiu1r,[Game Idea][Might Develop This] (Can’t Think Of Name),"I might develop this game after I’ve finished with my phobia game. But if you think this idea is good and have the skills to develop it, I say, go do it!\n\n#Central Idea\n\nYou play with 12-15 players. There is no voice chat at all but you can communicate through a notebook you each have, you also all have certain items for each class. The humans have to escape the camp grounds while a ghost is chasing them, here’s the thing, the ghost is AI. The ghost can kill players and after it kills its first player, is when the *real* game starts. Players will be alerted when a ghost has body stanched the first player, but nobody else. The ghost AI will examine players behavior and what they do, and write to other humans before killing one. After taking the body the ghost will act like the player and respond to other players notes. Players either A) have to find out who the ghost has possessed and kill them, or B)Escape with a certain number of players alive. Let’s get into a little more detail.\n\n#The Ghost\n\nThe ghost is invisible until it possesses someone. It can only possess one person at a time. But can swap between people after some time. It cannot swap between people if there are 4 or less people left.\n\nOnce possessing a player the ghost would act like them, taking phrases that are said a lot, their names from steam, and other things that they do to pretend to be a player. The ghost could be defended with spiritual items such as a crucifix, and holy water. \n\n#Humans\n\nHumans would have to either find a way to escape in various ways such as a car, train, or signaling for help. But they could also try to find out who the ghost is and kill, them, if you kill whomever the ghost is possessing, you win the game.\n\nThey would be certain things scattered around the map helping you escape, as well as guns and ammo helping you kill the person. There are 3 different classes for humans that you can pick. Each class with there own advantages, disadvantages, and one power.\n\n-Tracker: You get a tracking device and 3 tracking chips, these can be placed on players, and objects. These trackers will stay on the players/objects until taken off, while other classes can use tracking chips and trackers, (only able to be gotten from the tracker) they don’t spawn with them.\n\nAdvantages: Trackers are fast when sprinting, going at 115% unlike the usual 110%\n\nDisadvantages:Has the lowest vision in the game, only being able to see up to 45 m in front of him, unlike the usually 55 m. \n\n*Ability:* The trackers ability is pop up. He has the ability to see who or whatever the tracker is tracking, they will have an arrow over their head. The power last for 10 seconds, and has a cool down of 25 seconds.\n\n-Marksman: With this class you have a higher accuracy when shooting, and have a higher chance of finding weapons and ammunition in supply crates.\n\nAdvantages: Has a lower chance of being the first one possessed.\n\nDisadvantages:Moves the slowest in the game at 90% unlike the usual 100%\n\n*Ability:* The marksman ability is Deadeye, this gives marksman 0 bullet spread. The ability last for 5 seconds, and has a cool down of 45 seconds.\n\n-Detective: The detective can analyze clues, by seeing finger prints on objects when they inspect them. These can be used for a finger print scanner, which takes 15 seconds as along as neither the detective or whoever is getting scanned moves. This allows you to see the finger prints of a person, (which are randomly chosen from a list of let’s just say 20)\n\nAdvantages: The detective is faster when he’s crouching moving at 105% unlike the usual 90%\n\nDisadvantages:The detective, unlike other classes, is shaky, meaning that if hiding for over 30 seconds the detective will jump out of the spot.\n\n*Ability*:The detectives ability is follow the crowd. For 60 seconds he can see the footprints of everyone. The cool down is 120 seconds"

jwgg1g,Minecraft Adventure: A sandbox RPG,"This is an idea for a minecraft game, the minecraft game would be 3rd person and 3d, more of an adventure than a sandbox, the graphics would be like minecraft dungeons, the world is random generated and if your thinking of something to compare it to look at breath of the wild.\n\n* The Combat system:\n\nThe combat system would use several points, the system uses duel-wielding, each weapon would use different mechanics and attacks, you would be able to lock onto targets, ans you can block with certain weapons and utilities. Attacking with a bow would be in 1st person and you would slow down in midair. Weapons would be enchant customizable  and there would be more alloys with different perks. Dodging an attack quickly enough allows you to do a flurry rush, a flurry rush is a swift attack in which you dash towards your enemy and attack relentlessly, you can only do this with one-handed weapons.\n\n* Spelunking\n\nMining in this game would be a little different than in minecraft, instead of just mining, you would explore caves more and be able to mine the ores that appear here, it would have all the caves that exist and more that are being added in 1.17. This would add to the adventure of the game.\n\n* Villagers\n\nIn this games a main piece is the villagers, the villagers would be in villages and be able to trade, you would have to protect them from the illagers a lot and you could pay them to get lots of items and help them make there villages bigger. There would also be several new villager types.\n\n* Building\n\nYou would not be able to build like in normal minecraft, but you would be able to hire contractor villagers to build a schematic you make here and build it in your world, this way you could have a farm, or a base where you want to be.\n\n* Souls\n\nThe game would use a similar system to minecraft dungeons for souls uses, you could use souls to use artifacts, or weapons.\n\n* Stamina\n\nStamina would be basically hunger, it would go down very slowly, and faster when your doing certain tasks, it would take time to go down so that you don't have full stamina, do a charge attack, and suddenly your starving.\n\n* Travel\n\nTravel in this game would revolve and several features, you can climb many forms of walls using ladders, you can build up scaffolding when you aren't fighting, boats, horses, and striders don't require stamina, elytra could be used to fast travel and reach sky islands.\n\nDon't say ""this isn't realistic"", ""mojang won't do this"", or ""this is a minecraft clone"".\n\nPlease give feedback on what you would want in this game."

Hypothetically, the main menu would have all the *""levels""* available to choose from in any order to play one at a time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOr, you could go through them all in a randomized order. If you decided on the latter, then completing one demo would seamlessly transition you into the next, ideally building suspense as to which might follow. Aside from some polish to any technical hiccups that may have been present in the original demos, they'd play exactly the same way. Upon finishing them all, you'd receive a *""Thank You""* from each developer in the credits. It just sucks to see so many promising projects forgotten over time."

jvh3c6,"An SCP: Containment Breach Remake (no, not the Unity remake)","**(GAME IDEA STARTS ON 2ND PARAGRAPH)** Okay, so, I just beat SCP: Containment Breach and played a lot of the Unity remake and I began to scroll through the SCP website when I came across SCP-049's page. I listened to the audio recordings of the interviews when a thought occurred to me: ""What if someone remade Containment Breach with a backstory for the main character, cinematic events for introducing antagonists, and better quality and animation?""\n\nBasically, it's SCP: Containment Breach but higher quality rooms, models, and animations, more unique rooms, more SCPs, and cutscenes. An example of a cutscene I thought of was this: You are running away from a scripted encounter with another SCP (probably 106) instead of randomly encounter and when you make it to a door that will be your escape, SCP-049 will open the door and 106 will disappear. 049 will begin to say a speech instead of attack you right off the bat, entering a cutscene where you are slowly backing up as he approaches you ever so slowly, speaking about ""The Pestilence"" and ""The Cure"" before the cutscene ends and you have to run from 049.\n\nI also thought about some sort of backstory as to how the character you play as (D-9341) made his way into site 16. I don't really have any other ideas on this, but it would make the character a lot more ""in depth"" rather than just being thrown into the game right away. Maybe some sort of short intro cutscene, or prologue chapter, or anything like that could be cool.\n\nObviously the Unity remake is still going on and I am very much excited for that as well, but I kind of want to see the original game's design being remodeled rather than the entirety of site 19. It could even use the same models from Unity (specifically 173's new model) or just revamp the old ones to make them look smoother and nicer, I don't really know.\n\nAnyway, I would LOVE to see something like this happen, even though it most likely won't. It is one of my favorite horror games and the entirety of SCP is just fascinating and amazing to me. Thanks for reading!\n\nEdit 1: Unique kill animations for each SCP would be pretty cool as well"

But when you don't... it's awesome.\n\nPlayers can also deflect one or two magical killing blows using equipped, clearly visible magical amulets that break after one deflection. Friendly mages can also cast one-use blessings upon their allies. This effect is also visible.\n\nThere are also an array of Blessings intended to help against physical attacks, but the main goal of Blessings is to counter enemy magic. That way, magic can be incredibly destructive and exciting, without being overpowered.\n\nMages can cast low-damage area of effect spells or shortlived debuffs.\n\nGetting smacked by a powerful fireball will set you on fire screaming, and a frostbolt will interrupt your movement. If they strike on the ground a foot or two away, they should damage you a little and slightly deafen you.\n\n**Archers:**\n\nArchers are fast, but die easily. They have moderate, yet consistent damage against Warriors. Archers can kill mages very quickly because they have no armor, but the reverse is also true. Without armor, they die to mages' lighter attacks, and they get crumpled by warriors.\n\nThey can also climb more easily, walk quietly, and backstab.\n\n**Warriors:**\n\nIf a warrior gets in melee range, they win 90% of the time. They can charge up to the weaker units, all blessed up, and deflect spells and arrows while lopping a head off in one blow.\n\nWarrior vs. Warrior melee combat is super hard and skill based, like Mordhau.\n\nMages can protect anyone from one physical death blow, so the light classes have a tiny bit of chance against a warrior, especially a wounded one. A great player can absolutely kill a bad warrior using the mage's ceremonial dagger, or what have you.\n\n**Game Objective:**\n\nRespawns, with an objective to attack, like a flag or series of flags. This creates more combat, less taking cover.\n\nThis obviously isn't all specified out, but I want to give the feeling. It's Mordhau with fewer weapons and more magic.\n\nYou're going to feel naked without at least one warrior, one archer, and one mage in the party, but you can do whatever you want.\n\nThe map should have item pickups. This includes better weapons for warriors and archers, as well as consumable spell reagents.\n\n**Your Character**\n\nThe game could either have moderate character customizations on 3-ish classes, or it could have 5-10 classes with very little or no customization. I probably prefer customization on base classes. You should probably be able to play as a ""priest"" a ""berserker"" and a ""rogue"" either way.\n\nThere's also the option of no classes, only one malleable class that can have any weapons or spells within a budget, but that would probably make it harder to tell what's going on. A warrior could just forego pants, and just nuke you suddenly with the one fireball spell. Not the best.\n\nMagic also gives the game excuses to add in any convenient gameplay mechanic that would otherwise break realism. Like limited in-combat revives. And slightly higher survivability. But if nobody brings a mage or uses magic amulets, it's basically real life.\n\n**Practicality**\n\nSeems like you could just mod a game like Chivalry, Mordhau, etc.\n\n**Feedback**\n\nWhat types of character customization would you prefer in this context?\n\nDoes this spark any other ideas?\n\nDo you have a class or archetype you'd want included? Or should that class be more of a ""sub-class"" of the main three?"

jvf2uk,Dinosaur western game?,"Now hear me out, it sounds odd but I saw some cool splash art the other day of dinosaurs put into a western scene with cowboys (I guess I could thank the bl3 dlc for a little inspiration as well) but what about a game focusing on western expansion during the gold rush era but in a world where dinosaurs are still very alive and well and have began showing up from the direction of the unsettled western United States? The Wild West scene is already lawless and crazy so an alternate history in that setting seems like it could be really cool.\n\nVarious species that have appeared closer to settled areas are tamed for different purposes from acting as cattle wagons to riding horses to guard dogs and as you expand out further west you could meet new species to tame or have to defend yourself against. Could be a city/world building game where you are leading one of the first groups out there to establish a new settlement and eventual booming city. You’ll need to recruit workers of different backgrounds and skill sets to manage your city and provide different amenities to the people of the city who will in turn generate revenue, resources, etc for you. Being that tons of people migrated over to the west for new opportunities, you’d have tons of random people showing up, not always with dinosaurs in tow but maybe some manages to tame one, it’s up to you to decide if you let them into your society or turn them away. Turn away enough and maybe a new rival settlement forms of those you’ve denied entrance to and become a new threat in the area. Being that the core of heavily lifting is done by dinosaurs who aren’t bred in captivity or brought up in it their whole lives, you will need to learn how to interact with them and how to wrangle them into submission or gain their trust to maintain their cooperation lest they turn back to their wild selves and attack you and your settlement. \n\nBeing a frontiersman with dinosaurs at your disposal though, you’ll need to venture out from the town to explore the areas around for new settlement opportunities, new dinosaur species used for different purposes, to investigate threats to your people and kidnappings from your settlement and to explore why the dinosaurs began migrating away from this area years ago in the first place whether it was by choice or by force."
jve9gy,Organizing a game jam to encourage game dev amongst the community :),"This competition is hosted on itch and is meant to encourage game development culture (with cash prizes worth 300$) amongst indie developers and studios. You can join the Jam from this link- [https://itch.io/jam/gamejam-2020-ad](https://itch.io/jam/gamejam-2020-ad)\n\nI made a trailer for this JAM using a custom shader that I wrote for Unity. This shader uses one-sided features of multiple planes to give a non-euclidean look (currently working on a puzzle-game based project that uses this!)  Also, I wrote a shader to replicate the look of HDRP reflective materials using Unity's built-in render pipeline and a reflection probe. Added the materials based on these shaders to the mascots and the jar!  Gave the camera and objects some smooth animations and recorded the process!

jv80an,Arena combat meets trading card games,"hello everyone .. lately, a game idea has been eating me from the inside, and i haven't found anything like it .. the full idea that i have in mind is too big and ambitious and i know indie developers won't do it, so i'll try to make it as small as possible, where i only going to talk about the amazing combat system that i wish existed\n\n# background\n\ni have been a yu-gi-oh fan for long time when i was a teen .. although i stopped playing the game, but it's mechanics stuck with me, what i loved about it the most is the amount of creativity that you have in building your own deck, where you can use any card that ever existed (considering the ban-list) and forging multiple endless strategies, nowadays i am into anime 3rd person fighting games like naruto ultimate ninja storm, although the combat system is amazing on those games, it still feels repetitive sometimes, and very limiting, the limits that i felt are in the abilities, where one character has a certain predetermined set of moves, and if you grew tired of the move set, then you'll go to the other character that  has it's own predetermined move set, and you are stuck with those abilities with no room for customizing, and in those moments i remembered how much creativity fun that i used to have while playing yu-gi-oh, and then it hit me, what if there was a combat game where it doesn't matter what character you play with (so you can customize it), and the moves you perform are in card game style\n\n# the basics\n\nthis is a real time pvp, in a closed arena (like the naruto ultimate ninja storm franchise), each player will have a fixed HP and stamina, these won't ever change (cause there won't be a level up system) and when you perform a base attack you eat your stamina, things that will eat stamina as well, are parry, sprinting and blocking attacks, so far these are basic stuff that a lot of games have already, but here is where the fun starts, first of all, there will three types of weapons :\n\nsword : which is close range, and fast and pretty accurate\n\nstaff : it will have more range cause it's going to shoot withing certain radius, but it is slower but accurate\n\nbow: where you can have all the range in the world, but you have to aim\n\nthere will be multiple weapons from each type, and they will vary in the name,design, and base attacks value, as well for their ""talents"" (i will explain that later)\n\n# the abilities and customization\n\nthis is the selling point of this game, each player will have a deck of abilities (built beforehand by the player), each ability will have a description text, and these abilities will come in three types:\n\nskills : which are the physical attacks that the player performs, usually they are meant to deal certain amount of  damage. (for example : spin sword attacks, setting arrow mines ... etc)\n\nspells: which are abilities that either enhance your stats (enchantments), or weakens you opponent's stats (curses)\n\ncounter attacks : these are abilities that gets caste by the player, until the opponent does a certain thing, and then they will be performed automatically\n\n# timing is everything\n\nin trading card games or in battle games, there is always a resource system, like mana or stamina, but in this game, time is the resource, where each ability that you draw will have a predetermined refresh time (written in the ability description), from when you drew it from your deck, until you can use it, and even after you use it, if you didn't time it right, i mean, if your opponent blocked it or escaped it through parry, then it is wasted (lets call a used or a wasted ability ""burned"")\n\n# your hand\n\nyour ""hand"" will be to the side of the screen, where it will display the abilities that you have at hand, and it's gonna have three rows, one for each ability type, and each row going to have three columns, so at all times, you gonna have 3 ""spells"" at your disposal, 3 ""skills"" and 3 ""counter attacks"", for example if you burned a spell, then it will be replaced by an other random spell from your deck, but you won't be able to use it until after the refresh time on it is over\n\n# talents\n\ntalents : as mentioned earlier, weapons will come with ""talents"" that will set them apart from each other, each weapon will have only one talent, but, these talents will be repeatable, throughout the fight, and they of course have a refresh time between each use, these talents will be what you build your deck around, for example : imagine a weapon that says ""for 30 seconds each time you hit you inflict damage to your opponent, you get healed the same amount"", this weapon makes you comfortable in having good HP all the time, so you can build a deck with abilities around that talent that will utilize that advantage\n\n# combos\n\ndepending on the ability description, the combos could be endless, you can have a spell that says ""for 30 seconds you won't lose stamina"", and then a skill that will say ""spin attack that keeps going until you used all your stamina, and it uses X amount of stamina"" so theoretically this combo will give you 30 seconds spin attack, and based on this example you can see where creativity is key \n\ncombos abilities : this is a little sprinkle on top (can be added later on), where you have in a different predetermined deck (also built by the player), a set of abilities that get automatically activated if ability X and Y where used in sequence (the combo pieces must be specified in the combo ability description)\n\n# buying system\n\nat first i thought in a big campaign with a story mode, where you defeat bosses that will drop these weapons and different abilities to add them to your collection, but i think that can wait for an other day, it can have a simple loot box system where you get all these weapons and cool abilities\n\n# final thoughts\n\nat the end of the day, games like these are only as good as the amount of creativity that you put in the unique abilities (cards), and in the amount of those abilities, i personally have multiple ideas for different abilities/talents, if any developer is actually interested in this idea, then feel free to reach out so we can talk more about those ideas, and again, i know, this is a big project, that not meant for one person to do, it's just an itch i had in my mind that i needed to tell someone about it to scratch it, let me know what you guys think"
jv55sf,My game idea,
jv3qa8,Gameplay idea for story game.,[deleted]
jv1v1c,Purge BR?,"So I was watching the Purge, after playing Warzone, and thought, “What if there was a Purge themed Battle Royale? I know I may not be the only person to come up with this idea, but I would like to bring something to the table.\n\nOkay, so for player customization, there could be cosmetics you could buy using in game currency by surviving the Purge, robbing banks and places cash would be (you’ll get it in a minute), and here’s the catch, you have to survive the Purge to keep anything you loot during the Purge. You could get preorder cosmetics, maybe like the Smileys from the first movie or from the First Purge. You could buy, loot, or find plans for more cosmetics in a store sort of system.\n\nYou can buy guns that are base, with no attachments, and find attachments in the map. Stuff you find can be kept if you survive the Purge, including attachments. If you have more attachments than a gun can have, then a customization menu can be used to add different attachments. \n\nNext is the map. It could be a medium sized map, with different districts, such as a hills suburbia sort of place, a poorer district, and a city sort of area, each place could have a different amount of loot, with the City having the most, and poorer having less. The City could have sub-districts, such as a bank area for the players who just want money, to use in the for mentioned cosmetic shop, a self defense district for players that would like to purge their fellow players or defend themselves, along with a hospital to scavenge meds.for players that don’t want a huge map, there could be the island from the First Purge movie.\n\nNext up is functionality of the game. Unlike other Battle Royales,there wouldn’t be a wall of imminent death, but players would be driven to purge other players in a hunger games esqu senerio, where they can make groups with other players, or play with friends, but either way, you could purge everyone, and either be the last one standing like a normal br, or you could simply try to survive the whole match, which would last about thirty minutes. Players would start off with their friends if they had a pre-made group, in a set location, and move on from there.\nThis was how I think it should go if we get a Purge themed BR. All opinions are accepted."
jv11l8,An idea to help Sam Fisher one last time.,"In a literal dream I dreamt of a video game trailer and I woke up shedding a tear. A little back story the Splinter Cell story has been beaten to the point it’s not a even a horse any more but just guts. Even in his latest debut in a different game Rainbow 6 siege Sam Fisher given a short season with most lasting up to around 4 months. His lasted for 2. He was the center of attention and given the least amusing backstory in his bio. That should give you an idea on how much they care about him as a character and not a cash grab. If there is going to be a new splinter cell, make it his last. Straight up retirement. That what my dream at least suggested. In it idk why but Hello darkness my friend was playing. You see Sam running out of a smoking building. Something went extremely wrong. Come to find him in the middle of an enemy base. Hiding behind from piping. As the rain pour down hard he close his eyes. Memories then fade in. Starting out as Sam barbecuing while his daughter was setting up for a party. Immediately cut to a dark color setting of his sneaking around. Another bright memory pops in. It’s him saying hi to his daughter from his first day of school. Then to him watching in the dark a co worker getting killed. Losing his friend or maybe a student under his teaching in the fields. This continues for a few more switching back and forth from what he wants, versus what he had to endure to see his dreams. Then a slightly lit room with the only light source from a window. His daughter walks in. All grown up. Him in his chair old and tired. Clearly went to hell and back. Looking at his daughter he sees a letter. It’s the organization again. They want him back. Much like how Ubisoft brings him back. No reason other than “He’s the guy.” A cloud came in. Darkens the room when he realized this is his personal hell. Won’t be able to see his daughter grow up more, and may die in the process. We then cut to Sam. Taking one last breathe before switching to night vision. Title plays. And just before it ended we see them hugging at the door. Men in suit came, possibly to protect his daughter. Happen once, can impact her life again. With a forceful goodbye, he close the door, leaving his daughter. I’ll admit, this sounds like fan fic. But dammit that felt real and the only way to end. For them to admit they have abused Sam’s character and letting him rest at the end of the story. Thanks for looking at my ted talk."
juxh2a,Looking for week long project to work on to take a break from my main project,The title basically says it all! I have been working very hard on project with my cousin and I thought a little break from that would be nice! Something not too difficult but reasonably challenging. I’ve been working in 3D recently and I’ve been learning a bit about modeling. This would be solo project so it can’t be too convoluted. I have some people that I could go to for help for things like writing so story based is good too. I’m not a fan of text adventure so that might not be good for me. Thanks in advance for all of your ideas!!
juwqcj,Idea for a vr roguelike ?,I think this has some potential but I don't know where to start from... any idea ?
juthry,Mechaton the mech fighting game,So I suck at ideas but here’s an idea I guess\n\nSo in Mechaton you play as a mech and a pilot their are 10 pilots and 20 mechs\n\nPilots give you three things a passive an ability and finally a super\n\nFor example Mina her passive gives her a meter known as the intel meter each time she punishes an attack she gets a point in the meter when she’s at 10 she gets a permanent buff making her movement speed faster her ability is a parry and her special gets rid of all her intel but is a giant explosion \n\nThe game would be a mix between street fighter 5 and marvel it will have a slower paced footsie game but incredibly intense high octane combos \n\nThe game is six buttons two lights two mediums and two heavy attacks \n\nCombos would be unique each character has around 5-10 moves known as linkers these chain normal moves together\n\nNormal moves can be canceled into specials and linkers but linkers can only cancel into specials \n\nYou can only air dash forward and you can airblock \n\nYeah it’s a rather simple idea I’m still building upon it
jusjqr,Lord of the rings,"Basically a build your own kingdom game but LOTR at the start you choose race. Humans,elves,dwarves etc you then choose specific kingdom/city like Gondor or Rivendell and Rohan. Then it’s simple going from there like adding a campaign that follows the actual story and you train troops for that specific kingdom so you will train Rohirrim horsemen for Rohan. And if any developer takes this idea please make sure the battles are cool like not a few soldiers fighting a few orcs and you can only view from the world map. I realize this would take a lot of work so please don’t hate I am just dreaming here but if anyone would do it would be awesome."

junk14,"A short class- based game where every time you beat the game, your build gets added to the final boss's moveset.","In your first play through, the final boss is trivial/plain and you don't likely pay the ""cursed"" title any attention. After you defeat the boss, a cutscenes plays and your character/ build is shown to become possessed and they become the final boss. It then shows you getting reincarnated and it's revealed that you need to do this a certain amount of times in order to actually break the curse and save the world. \n\nThe gameplay idea here is that every time you beat the game, you're forced to choose another class in order to defeat the previous ones. There are many games with many playstyles and people seem to just gravitate towards one and not play the others. The idea is to force you to try out every major playstyle (the number of playthroughs needed to truely beat the game.) Since your old playstyle gets added as the end, each playthrough gets more and more difficult as there's more movesets that you need to be able to counter. It should also feel like you're using your knowledge of the strengths and weaknesses of your old build against the final boss.\n\nThere are two major mechanical problems with this idea. First, I don't really know what to do between the final boss fights. I was thinking that maybe later game enemies start getting thrown at you earlier in the playthrough that are difficult moveset-wise but are scaled number-wise. This is to keep the climbing difficulty consistent but also to accelerate your leveling by giving you later rewards earlier. These enemies should probably follow player builds somewhat so you have an idea of how to play them. \n\nThe second issue is creating classes where you can play in any order and still beat what eventually becomes a final boss using literally everything besides your playstyle. All I can say here is that each class must have some type of unique weakness to every other class.\n\nAnother more  simple version could be that the next game is against the class you just played as with your character as the final boss. Say you play as a wizard, your next playthrough is against a ton of mages. Let's say you defeat the wizard game as a knight, the next playthrough is against a ton of knight like enemies with your knight character as the final boss, etc. \n\nI know this idea is unique but the core of it is a game that forces you to learn each playstyle progressively better and create a progressively more challenging gameplay loop. Please let me know your thoughts."

Your loadouts may be self made entirely, for your primary consisting of many many parts and pieces that would modify and change how the gun may work, each having a section, like ""reload option"",""barrels"",""stocks"",""body"", ""handle"", and ""accessories"". This may be the truly hard part of the game, balancing what does what and the possible down sides and upsides to each part, you would also have to do the same for the secondary weapon, all players have a starting custom class that they make, a max of 7 that you can unlock, also for this game, when you level up the weapon, it gets a better look overtime, level 1 looking very very bootleg like all the way to 40 looking like a real weapon\n\nI am honestly interested to see what people think or have thoughts on my old idea that I have had since I was in early middle school"
jqllai,Watched a Men In Black movie recently and this game tie in has been on my mind for days straight.,"So like I said. I recently watched the newest Men In Black movie (I have a soft spot for the franchise so I had to at least watch it) but it made me realize there was never a great MIB tie in game. Or I at least have never heard anyone say anything amazing about the old tie in games. This also made me realize that I actually had a pretty cool idea for a MIB game\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst off it would be structured like Hitman Blood Money. You are a Rookie agent in the MIB and your job is to hunt down MIB's top wanted aliens. you start with small time criminals eventually taking down alien mob bosses and worse, and Each level would be it's own mini encased open world much like Hitman 2. Before each mission you are given free range of the MIB armory (Early levels would only have a basic choice of  a few simple MIB guns and gadgets, each mission will increase your rank and allow you to pick from more guns and gadgets). You are then dropped into the level with the basic details of the alien you are hunting down. In most levels the alien will usually be disguised as a human and you will have to sneak around the level until you find one that matches the correct profile. From that point you are free to take him down how ever you please. Do it stealthy and smart and they won't even have a chance to ditch their disguise. But go in loud and guns blazing you run the risk of human ai seeing you or seeing the alien after he ditches his disguise.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnce you take down the alien or bring him in a MIB van shows up and you are shown your stats for the level. If you went in too loud or too crazy the public will know about aliens and the MIB. So you use what ever resources you have to control the flow of information. It costs time and resources to neuralyze and track down the people who might of saw you or the alien. Plus you have to pay for clean up. The messier the job the more it costs to clean up and keep things under wraps while doing it. You can skip on these costs but the more you do the more people begin to start believing in the MIB and aliens. As this suspicion goes up your jobs become harder. Aliens are quicker to ditch their human disguises if they see you coming. Knowing that they are much more powerful in their natural alien body. As this suspicion grows random ai will start to notice you in future levels. Your signature outfit is easy to spot in most places so word spreads of you fast and it might even tip off the alien or his henchmen if they hear talk of MIB in the area and that you are looking for them. Once you clean up any mess you are brought back to MIB HQ to either lock up the alien or bring back proof of their death. You are facing some of the baddest aliens around so not every alien is going to come in willingly. You are then told the cover story of what happened during your mission that the press will send out. These are a more fun take on Hitman Blood Money's news paper mission enders. Each one would be a silly cover up that would change based on your actions (Used a alien rifle a lot? the news article would explain it as a ""test"" of sound effects for some secretively filming movie in the area. or ect. I am bad at coming up with cool ideas. But you get the gist, just fun little articles that you might see on a conspiracy theorists wall.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere in MIB HQ you can use what ever money and resources you did not spend on cleaning up the mess on upgrades and new weapons. Testing them out in the firing range and being able to just explore HQ freely. Talking to other agents and then gearing up again once you have talked to your boss about the next target.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI like the idea of it being a stealth game. But I am not sure how well it would work considering the MIB only wear black suits. Might be hard to work stealth into it, Maybe have it be like more Assassins Creed where you can blend in with crowds and sneak by that way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo over all I see the game as kind of a combo of Prey 2's original gameplay where you were an alien bounty hunter plus Hitmans more enclosed large open levels and stealth tactics. with Blood Money sprinkles by having to keep normal people calm and quite by spending your resources to keep them thinking everything is ""normal"". It might not be the best game ever but it has been stuck in my head for the last couple days."
jqk5n1,"A military shooter game, but both in and out of VR","Ok so hear me out. You may be thinking ""that just sounds like superhot with extra steps"" (and you're not too far off I guess, but that's VR in VR) but that's not what I'm thinking. I think a good idea for a game would be a singleplayer first person shooter game where you can switch from in/out of VR. It could have campaign missions in both modes, but mostly VR. You could control robots or something of the sort via traditional flat screen game for certain missions, then when you're being ""sent into battle"" you put your VR headset on and play. Or maybe a Titanfall style game where you control a big robot or something of the sort in VR, but you play as yourself on the flat screen.\n\nI am aware that this would probably be hard to make and isn't the greatest idea (lol being high makes everything sound like a good idea), but I think it would be pretty cool."
jqihxr,A game where you have the power of a God,"A super hero type of game, but where you are more powerful than anything we've seen before in a game. I just think it would be cool to realize all the destructive capability a player could ever want. Instead of fighting dozens of enemies at a time, you battle entire armies. There are also super villains who have similar powers and after you both clash, it looks like a nuclear bomb just went off in the surrounding area. \n\nThere would be 5 Main classes : Archon (Energy Manipulation), Psychon (Telekinetic Manipulation), Bio-killer(Organic Manipulation), Technopath (Technologic Manipulation), Brutus (Super speed/strength)\n\nThe Archon could do things like charge up a Spirit Bomb, the Psychon would lift up entire buildings, the Bio-killer could cause an earthquake with tentacles and the Technopath could summon a wall of turrets all going off simultaneously. \n\nThere are 4 enemy factions to do battle with : Synth Corp (who unleash Mutants), Confederation (who use Giant Mech Suits), Celestial Order (who evoke Trans-dimensional Aliens), and The Academy (who create living Elementals).\n\nYou would have a slowly regenerating health pool, but enemies could still wear you down over time. There is also a mission time limit so its a race against the clock. In general it could have co-op and maybe the end-game could be randomly generated instances and a scaling difficulty."
jqhxqd,Any simple game ideas for a challenge.,I'm a 13 yr old gamedev and I would like to start my first non game jam games.

I just got into Madden recently, and was wondering how awesome it would be to pick one player, one position (one offense, one defense), and either run your routes, or make your blocks in first person. \n\nMadden is perfect and all, but the distant camera kind of takes you out of the drama of actually playing a snap.

But if y'all want to hear more I'll reply in comments or send me a msg idk...\n\nSo, you start as a young boy in the campaign... around 14-16 years old. And during the ravages of the first month of the infection you have to choose what to do in your life, what you want to contribute to your community..\n\nSo you can choose different careers that are crucial; car mechanic, electrician, civil engineer, architect, plumber, farmer, field doctor, and others.\n\nOnce you choose your career you will be assigned an instructor who will teach you what you need to know to survive as your profession... \n\nThe purpose of this game is to let the person learn and have fun. Also help teenagers find fun in careers. Instead of being boring like a simulator, you can realise what you can do with your knowledge. Game will teach you real facts about your profession and allow you to learn the basics of each career. While also focusing on the survival factor... Finding food, finding water, killing zombies, raiders, bandits, etc.\n\nLearning how to ration food, learning the uses of math and science in an apocalypse. \n\nThen, in multiplayer... ehh too long to explain here...

You don’t have any modern tech, so how do you convince them?\n\n\nA magical TSA.\n\n\nYou start with next to nothing except cash, and must hire people and things to create both “Actual Safety” and “Perceived Safety”, two important things!\n\n\n“Perceived Safety” is how the people think of your airline’s danger. High perceived safety results in less attempts of terrorism - but almost will never stop an actual attempt. Perceived Safety is what brings in more customers!\n\n\n\n“Actual Safety” is the level your airline can actually stop terrorists. Hiring invisible guards, for example, increases Actual Safety but not Perceived Safety. The Aerolinear Police Department pays you high sums of cash for arresting terrorists, which means it may be viable to catch as many terrorists as possible instead of attracting customers!\n\n\n\nThe game itself plays like any other business game. You see the flow of customers and similar statistics. However, you have a menu to buy things with that is your Magic Department.\n\n\nFrom the Magic Department, you can hire several things, like “Metallurgists”, which can detect metal objects to prevent weapons from boarding.\n\n\nNeed to make sure there’s better public representation?

Every chapter would contain characters and a smaller plot line exclusive to it. You would start in a small town where you live, and the end goal is in a city named UniTropolis. \n\n#The Planned Ending \n\nOnce you arrive there and do some investigation with the help of some new allies, you would discover they were killed after being abducted for a cult experiment. Once Nick finds this out, he turns to dark magic to find and get revenge on the person responsible out of blind rage and not being able to handle his feelings. \n\nThe last chapter would be in two parts, with you not playing as Nick but one of his friends trying to stop him, due to him becoming unmerciful and corrupted from said Dark magic. \n\nThe final battle would be him getting knocked out, removing the darkness from him. With the ending being him trying to better himself and cope with the death of his parents. A bitter sweet ending \n\n_______________\n\nThis is still just a mere idea, and I’ve just now started laying down the foundations on how I think it should go. I have 2 people helping me so far, and I’ve created a subreddit to help document my ideas. *(Ask)*\n\nWhat do you think?"
jpypob,We need more grand strategy games that focus on intelligence and not on warfare.,"So there is only 1 game I know of that focuses on the intelligence side of conflicts and not on the tanks and planes side. It's called Precipice and it's cute, it has enough content for maybe 4 rounds, total. \n\nSo to to into a bit more detail. I want a grand strategy game that instead of being like HoI4 which basically only focuses on warfare, or vic2 that almost exclusively focuses on economy and trade. Focuses on building a national intelligence network (like CIA or Mossad), conducting covert operations abroad in domestically, destabilizing governments, managing agents, sabotage and maybe even using data you collect to successfully wage wars (making it so that if you don't have informants in the right places, enough satellites or planes your army wouldn't be able to see more then 10 kilometers in front of them putting them in a huge disadvantage, or if you manage it successfully putting you in a huge advantage.), Counter - espionage, ect... \n\nIt naturally also needs to have management elements to it."
jpt4ko,Deal with a Eco System Simulation and Human Tribes using your Skill and Technologies from the world you came from.,"#Premise\n\nYou find yourself in a world in which most humans don't know how to use most technologies. The world still has a bunch of human-made items for you to find/build and use against the dangerous animals, hazardous plants and harsh environment. You will lure, trap, destroy your path to victory.\n\nOnce you start finding, defeating, getting past and dealing with human tribes, you realise that they've acquired the ability to tame wild and dangerous animals.\n\nAfter a while, you will be able to find the four ""Dungeons"". Giant buildings, remnants of the past containing humans that have both learned to use technogies and have tamed animals.\n\nYour mission is to rescue your friends by gathering power, technogies and information from the dungeons. Pinpoint your friends prison and free them from the strongest and smartest human tribe which has captured them.\n\nI want the creatures of the system to be rather predictable, so no random gene bullshit for animals.\n\n#Animals\n\nSome animals will eat or harvest plants, others will hunt other animals. Of course they'd also need to drink from watering holes. Animals will reproduce until a certain amount of them are in the game.\n\nBasic Stats for animals\nHealth\nHunger\nThirst\nReproduction\n\nIf a animal dies, it drops meat of different sizes.\n\nWhen a animal has satisfied all of it's needs, it will wander randomly.\n\n#Plants\n\nPlants will have different growth stages. Some will start spawning ""falling seeds"", which will be affected by the wind.\n\nOther plants might have other ways of spreading their seeds.\n\nPlants will also grow faster when it rains or when near a water source. A seed that drops into water counts as a dead plant which can also be eaten.\n\n#Weather System\n\nPotentially adding a day/night cycle and sleeping behaviours for animals and humans.\nWind would randomly broadcast a wind direction and wind strength to all seeds.\nRandomly start and stop raining.\n\n#Humans\n\nHuman Tribes likely won't work similar to animals.\n\nThey will be guarding specific areas.\n\nMost of them will be guarding, patrolling their areas.\n\nSome of them will be seen fighting with other tribes or camping.\n\nSometimes they will try to directly attack you or even manage to capture you.\n\nThey are armed with spears and other stone-age weapons. There are also some high-level humans who are able to tame animals and even higher level humans who can use technologies. Those will even create traps like spike traps and arrow traps.\n\nHumans drop ""human meat"". A variant of meat that can't be eaten by the player unless playing on a ""Harvey"" or ""Easy"" difficulty."

jpmn0n,A celebration of Mario Party and it's history... With a twist.,"I think the perfect Mario Party should be a game celebrating it's history as a whole. **And is not another ""Top 100"" minigame collection.**\n\nThink Sonic Generations but perhaps with new twists, maybe combining two boards into one due to Bowser having some Space Time shenanigans and slightly altered goals but still based around collecting Stars.\n\nSo you could have boards combining E. Gadd's Garage from 6 with King Boo's Haunted Hideaway from 8. You can not tell me that would not be interesting, maybe have it act like your hunting down ghosts to get stars they contain and King Boo has 3, but instead of paying you have to fight them in a short Boo or Luigi's Themed minigame.\n\nMaybe some more random combinations like Pirate Dream from 5, but it's now underwater because it merged with Deep Bloober Sea from 3. So you have to deal with a bunch of Cheep Cheeps and the Blooper Baby who will call for his mother swimming around.\n\nAnd of course, a Bowser Level that takes iconic set pieces and areas of previous Bowser levels in past games, but the setup can still feel unique.\n\nPlus this can open up the chance for minigames to return from prior games, but with some new twists like combining two old games into a brand new one as well.\n\nLike Burnstile from Mario Party 6 combined with Hexagon Heat from Mario Party 2 where you have to run to a colored platformwhile the spiked arm spins in the middle one, forcing you to multitask between watching Toad's flag and keep track of the spiked arm.\n\nThese types of minigames could be the purest form of chaos and it would be perfect for Mario Party.\n\nFeel free to discuss ideas for what crazy combinations for maps and minigames you'd like to see yourself as well as your thoughts on this crwzy idea."

jpdp2c,Graffiti Tag - A mobile AR / location based tag game,"I’m sorry in advance for probably being way too vague and unstructured. I know nothing about game development, but I thought this would be a fun game:\n\nAs indicated in the title, it’s a location based AR game. \n\n\nStart by creating your own custom digital art / graffiti. \n\n\nTake a picture of a real life location (wall, building, etc.) \n\n\nStamp your pre-drawn graffiti on the object in the picture, or draw free hand. \n\n\nUpload the image, which will Tag! the image as a landmark on the map. \n\n\nDepending on the size of the tag, it takes longer/shorter amounts of down time to complete the tag. During this time you can’t do much else. \n\n\nIf you stay in the general area (via GPS) the time goes faster, and slows down the farther away you go. \n\n\nTag as many objects as you can to accumulate points, and establish dominance in your location, and spread your territory. \n\n\nTagging larger objects (eg. buildings) gives you more points and influence, than small objects (eg. stop sign). Larger objects require multiple tags to ‘claim’ them.\n\n\nI imagine there could be some sort of other fun pvp and/or team based battles and challenges. Something similar to Turf Wars or those sorts of games, but more up to date and interesting. (Sorry, I know this is where the idea needs a lot of work)\n\n\nBuy paint, rollers, etc. Use the resources to paint over an opponents graffiti, so you can tag the spot with your own. Maybe you can buy upgrades with in game credits to protect your tags.\n\n\nDepending on the location, time of day, or random chance, you could be ‘Busted’ by the cops while trying to tag an object. You get fined, or face other consequences.  \n\n\nYou might also get ‘Jumped’ by your opponents. Perhaps if a rival is near your location (via GPS) you can be prompted to jump them and steal their resources. \n\n\nIdeally it would be really cool if there was an AR function to overlay the graffiti, so when you look at things through your phone you can see everyone’s tags. \n\n\nThanks for hearing me out!"

I’ve got the mechanics, the game design document, and even a rough draft of how I’m gonna go about creating it.

jo79z1,The Cosmic Balance Resource Manager,"I doubt I will ever get good enough at making RM games to do this so I'm throwing it out into the ether for an eager(er) game maker to pick up ;)\n\nSo how about a game similar to the Sims but you don't control the people in the little world, you just observe them and keep track of their stats which might be Enlightenment, Essence, and Entanglement (the three Es of managing the after life). \n\nSo the little people of this world are born, grow, get old in quicker than normal time of course. As they do different things, it effects their Enlightenment. Robbing a bank might hurt their enlightenment, while being charitable or helping people as a whole might increase their Enlightenment. When a person's Enlightenment is high enough they get to go to ""The Light"" and when it dips too low they have to go to ""Another Place"". \n\nEach person has an ""Essence Clock"" and when it runs out you have to arrange a way to kill the person with things that happen around them on THAT DAY (i.e. maybe there is a trash truck on their road that is notorious for not paying attention so BAM or maybe the person likes to swim a lot so GURGLE etc). And a little grim reaper comes to get them. \n\nNow, once they are dead you have to decide if they have enough Enlightenment to either reincarnate them, in which case you send them to the hospital and they are reborn, or if they have enough Enlightenment to go ahead to the Light or so little they can't reincarnate and have to go to the Other Place. \n\nThe last bit is Entanglement. If a person has too much Entanglement, counted by unresolved things in their current life, you have to work really hard at catching their soul with a reaper, otherwise they might become a ghost and then you might have to resolved their issues for them instead of doing with them what needs to be done.\n\nI'm thinking you would start with one office in the afterlife with a limited collection of Reapers and maybe a smaller town that you manage then your office gets bigger, you get more resources, your town becomes a city to manage, etc. \n\nThoughts? Concerns? Tapioca? \n\nAs a note, I've read Reincarnation Blues a LOT. I recommend the light read its wonderful."

jo0r6u,Puzzle game idea.,I've noticed a lot of the game jams have similar mechanics. I have been thinking of mking a game where the puzzle mechanics change over time. For instance one game from out of control gmtk you have a specific area where your actions get recorded. When you leave the area your actions follow that movement pattern. Another one you are shooting a laser from your eyes and cant hit anyone but pass through rooms. So you start off with the first mechanic then go through rooms where you shoot lasers and have to follow the movements from a specific area then you only shpot lasers through your eyes. So you kinda cycle through eaach of the mechanics but the theme remains constant.

jnq1f5,Idea for a Legend of Zelda game.,"Obviously in a lot of the games there is ""The Hero of Legend""(Link) and they mention him having past adventures leaving one to conclude that he in some way reincarnates.\n\nMy idea is in one of his reincarnations Zelda is with ""with child"" and in an attempt to stop Gannon link splits his soul into multiple pieces and uses them like a lock and keys to seal Ganondorf away. This does not kill him, but does leave him weak and powerless. \n\nMeanwhile, a piece of Link's soul settles in Zelda's unborn child. When the child is born it is the next reincarnation of Link. As the child grows up the lock on Ganondorf starts to weaken so young Link must go on a journey and collect the other pieces of his soul, giving him new powers, abilities, wepons, gear, and the strength to fight Ganon.\n\nI find the fact that there would be two Link's alive, one old and wise but powerless and the other young and naive but able to grow, intriguing. Anyway, that's my idea. It's not much, but it's mine lol."

I completed the entire map; texturing, models, interiors, everything.\n\nThe problem is, I abandoned the project and am just now coming back to it, but have no idea what the whole game was about.\n\nIt’s a city (a hospital, a police station, a communications building, 2 grocery stores) surrounded by residential houses (supposedly where the players spawn in, each player having their own house).\n\nI’m just looking for any game ideas of what I can do with this map! I’d hate for all this work to go to waste."

jn9m2v,The Thing video game in style of Among Us,"Although The Thing is my favorite Carpenter film, one of the failings of the film was the third act that betrays the premise. The film at its heart was about a nuanced, quiet, mysterious character-centric thriller until the third act betrays the premise and becomes a bombastic alien action kaiju flick. Imagine the last 20 minutes of Alien was the last 20 minutes of Aliens, and that was what The Thing felt like for me.\n\nThe 2002 video game had some solid ideas related to unknowable, but the most of the game was pretty much a standard TPS with guns and blazing, pretty much an adaptation of the tone of the film's third act.\n\n The Thing could be a fantastic IP to become an online multiplayer social deduction game in the style of *Town of Salem*, *The Ship*, or *Among Us*.\n\nIdea:\n\nPremise: You have three *Things* and six *humans* in the start. Humans need to figure out how to get out of the base such as contacting the army or finding helicopter fuel. The Things need to thwart the human's effort and infect them all.\n\nDuring the normal playthrough, it plays a lot similarly to *Friday the 13th* game. It is a slow-paced first-person (or a third-person) game. Humans have a low visibility due to the storm outside. Humans can find and use tools and weapons such as pistol, flares, flashlight, flamethrower, axe, shotgun, scattered around the base randomly for each match. The base is hard to travel due to the obstacles like locked doors and blackout. The humans need to find ways to solve these problems like finding keys and fixing the circuits, which means they have to inevitably scatter.\n\nMeanwhile, the Things can take advantage of this situation in disrupting human activities. Humans do not know who the Thing is among them, but Things do, and can do a hidden chat with each others to plan and  ommunicate. Things can see through darkness, so they can break a bunch of things in the base to make environment friendly to them. Things have high-HP. Things can insta-kill humans in close-contact and assimilate the player into the Thing side.\n\nThe players can gather and debate the identites, listening to eyewitness testimonies and finding contradictions. Eventually, the players will factionalize, leading to the players killing each other in demise. One of the rare items is a blood testing device which tells who is the human or the Thing.\n\nI think this could make a fantastic game in the spirit of the film."

jn6pcs,Multiplayer city war game idea,"I'd like to describe my idea for a game and see what you think about it, etc. This is just a very general draft of the game idea and it's totally open for all of your suggestions.\n\nSo it is a multiplayer game where before you start you can create your start own map, for example something like a town (based on city skylines) but with the very basic graphic. Then you can share this map on the server and other people can either create their own map (server) or join to your map. For example if five players will join to one map then the game starts. \n\nThese five players are spawned in five random places on the map and controls their characters from the first perspective view. The main goal for them is to destroy the let's say VIP building (the most imporstant building in the game, the aim for the players). But they are fighting with each other also, because only one person can win the game. Players can find some kind of weapons on a map. The host of the map is also playing but not as a person on the map like them but he has a camera like on the city skylines from the top so he sees all of the players and he has to protect somehow the VIP building and  make it difficult for players to get there, for example he has to build some kind of walls, some security posts, turrets with plots, etc., so the players will see those things and have to somehow destroy or go workaround them. Of course the host has also something like limited cash to spend, but he can also earn that cash from some shops, factories on the map, and players can also destroy that kind of buildings to stop earning money by the host. \n\nSo this is my very general idea draft for a game, what do you think?"
jn51xo,The Boss - Rogue-like (but not really),"One of the possible 'unlock-able' things players acquire as they slowly fight the boss could be aesthetic changes; such as armor/weapons. The game will likely be best executed in 3rd person. \n\nThis is all the game ever will be. You, the room you spawn into, and the boss. Simple menus back at the start screen to instantly go back into the action. \n\nOne of the possible 'unlockable' things players acquire as they slowly fight the boss could be aesthetic changes; such as armor/weapons. The game will likely be best executed in 3rd person. \n\nThe only thing that can determine 'how far' the hero can go is dependent on their own skill. So the game, while lacking in 'content,' will require a very immersive, fluid, and in-depth combat system. The AI of the boss will also need to be quite polished. Preference is a melee-centric game. \n\nHowever, there is a progression to the game: The farther into the boss's 'hp' you go, the more difficult the boss becomes. Perhaps the boss gets new moves or faster/reads inputs to increase response times to the player. The HP bar of the boss will always be hidden.\n\nPerhaps there are randomized elements about the arena/room in which the boss fight takes place that would allow both the boss and the player to take advantage of to gain the upper hand. \n\nPerhaps the boss is beatable; but with a not-set attack pattern that responds to the player, it would be an accomplishment of skill and dedication. \n\nWhile all of this is just suggestions for what should be implemented, the crux of the idea is a simple, fast game you can start up, have an epic boss battle, and then resume whatever it is you were doing. There's no milling about; no complicated menus. \n\nP.S.: I have no idea what to flair this as the idea is simple, the scope of the game is very small. But the requirements to make it a fun and entertaining experience will be challenging to implement well. So experienced?"

jn2jqq,Experience system,"While thinking about the exp system in my game  I came across 2 ideas which are kinda similar but IDK which is better\n\nIf you die in the combat area, you lose the exp/items you gathered\n\nTo leave the combat area you have to go back to the entrance, so if you're deep in the combat area and leave, you have to make your way back to that point  \n\nthe exp systems I'm thinking of are \n\n1. Fight x to gain exp which can be used to upgrade your stats once you leave the combat area and it's also used to unlock the next level (so you must choose if you want to spend 10k exp to unlock lvl2, leave combat area to spend exp upgrading stats, keep gathering exp above 10k so you can unlock lvl2 and use extra exp to upgrade stats later but risk losing it all)  \n\n2. Fight x to gain exp which automatically keeps upgrading your stats and it's also used to unlock lvl2 (if it costs 10k exp to unlock lvl2 and you have 15k exp in stat upgrades when you unlock lvl2 than you'll have 5k exp in stat upgrades after unlocking lvl2)\n\nI'm just looking for some opinions on these exp systems, anything is appreciated :)"

jmzkvo,Ideas for a Classical Music Game,"Hello everyone!\n\nI'm a software developer / pianist and I want to make a mobile game about classical music.\n\nMy main goal is to somehow ""teach"" about the difference between eras (Baroque, Classical and Romantic), composers' lifes and the history behind some pieces while making it an entertaining experience. \n\nIt can be intended for kids but I would like to come up with something fun for everyone to play.\n\nSo here are a few ideas I've had, from the easiest one to the hardest one, all of them having its soundtrack 100% classical music:\n\n- A Visual Novel (basically an interactive story) where the sprites are made with composers pictures and the backgrounds with old paintings. The story would be something like: you are sent back in time to help composers finish some specific pieces in order to save the history of music. The ""learning"" will be through the dialogues and the gameplay would be your choices and mini games in between.\n\n- A 2D RPG where you are a composer and have to fight enemies and collect items in order to complete your missions. I particularly see this much more fun than a Visual Novel, but the main problem here is the art, since I am no good making pixel art and couldn't find any assets that fit this style of game.\n\n- A puzzle game made with clay (pretty much like 12 Locks for Android), and after clearing a level you would unlock ""a book"" containing some info about composers or pieces where you could read and learn from it. Here the main challenge is to make all the assets with clay myself, but I really like this kind of art and wouldn't mind giving it a try.\n\nPlease feel free to give any other ideas or suggestions, I'm really looking forward to it!!"

k98ewi,"A multiplayer card game like ""one"", but the cards are natural disasters or things of mass destruction and each player has a country to protect.","The turns in the game would be rotating as in ""one"". Each player would have a country or city to protect. The cities would be on a standard map so that all players would have the same map and terrain where they would locate their buildings and main points such as hospitals, army, supply points. At the beginning of the game, cards will be dealt randomly to everyone, and when it is the turn of a player, he will not be able to see the city of the next player but will be able to choose in which points on the map he wants to activate a card. Depending on the card this will have a range of major or minor damage, for example earthquakes or asteroids. \nBut if they don't get it right the damage will only be to the ground.Destroying a key point would create problems, such as destroying a hospital would make people no longer able to heal. Or destroying the navy would make them unable to defend themselves against attacks from soldiers or missiles. The player with the most inhabitants will win."

k96i6d,A game sorta like risk.,"I'm not sure if a game like this exists, but I've always wanted a game like this. So essentially there are 2 or more armies. (Depending on how many you choose.) The game would play out like risk, you attack connecting countries. The end goal would be to either take the capital or to dominate the world. Instead of dice rolling though or whatever, when you attack a country the game turns into an FPS. You and your army have to capture regions, whoever conquers the most regions by the time a time limit runs out, they either capture (or defended) that country. So it starts with an overworld map, then when you attack a country it goes into a region's map. To take a region it would be like a game of domination in battlefield, whoever holds the most points takes that region and moves onto the next region. You have to be careful though, every time you load into a country you can select a certain amount of units to take with you, tanks, planes, etc. If they get killed or destroyed then they're gone. So let's say you attack a region with 100 people, and only 20 people make it. Those 20 can either stand and defend or move on to attack until you call in reinforcements. The game would still act like an FPS though, with custom classes and stuff. Also, each region/country would be different gameplay-wise. The towns/areas would be unique to the actual area in the world. So let's say you attack Egypt, it would be a desert. If you attack Antarctica, it would be snowy. Etc. I also understand that a game like this would take forever to play, and that's why I'm thinking it should primarily be a single-player game. Also, you could do special missions where you can infiltrate enemy bases and stuff as special ops units, you could infiltrate a factory and blow it up to stop the production of tanks or something like that. So when you destroy the enemies tanks, they can't call in reinforcements. I have a lot more ideas for this game and it would get really deep, but i just wanted to share the basic idea."
k95km5,"A game like Pokemon, except you play as the kids who are playing Pokemon","That headline was confusing, so let me explain.\n\nI've always had a soft spot for games that are set in real, modern-day society — much like Persona or TWEWY. I like the feeling of balancing school/work life against some other supernatural pursuit. Even Harry Potter has this feeling to it. It allows you to write characters that are genuinely relateable, but still provide gameplay that's more interesting than simply going to school/work.\n\nNow, what if we had an RPG where the kids were — canonically — playing an AR game like Pokemon GO? I imagine it to be somewhat like Persona. The daytime segments would involve school life, and the after school segments would involve running around the neighborhood, catching Pokemon, and fighting rival trainers.\n\nYou could still structure it like a regular Pokemon game with 8 gyms if you want to. Just make the characters a bit older (high school instead of late elementary school), and have them travel around the city in search of these MMO hotshots. And of course the gym leaders will all be hilarious in real life — the turbo nerd, the guy who looks like a jock but actually plays video games, etc etc.\n\nWell, that would be cool, but I really imagine it more like [Boku no Natsuyasumi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX2I0YanKMg) (which I haven't played yet, but it looks great). A game where you can just run around town and be a kid, but contextualized with the objective of catching new Pokemon and training to ""be the best""."
k914q1,A magic casting indie game with cool combat.,"A PvE action adventure game where u learn new spells as u fight against  zealots and cultists that practice magic as well.\n\nCombat works like this.\n\nEvery spell is made of a combination of signs(arm gestures). for example 4 buttons on controller are mapped to 4 different signs(arm gestures).For ex, To throw fireball , u must perform the right signs/gestures in the right order and press execute button to activate.\n\nNow comes the fun part.\n\nenemies will also cast spells like this. which means u can predict which spells they are going to attack you with by looking at the gestures , and so u can counter accordingly. if u recognize that your enemy is creating a fireball, u can create a water shield if u have time to perform the counter spell, which will depend on how many gestures the spell requires.\n\nAlso experienced players can start with the intention of casting one spell, but switch to another spell that requires the same initial gestures mid cast if the battle situation changes and another spell becomes more useful.\n\nNow the main idea of the game.\n\nYour character will have the  unique ability to steal gestures from enemies. This will not only allow you to stop a spell from an enemy, but u can also use the gestures to complete your own gesture combination , thus quickening your cast time.\n\nFor ex, if u are standing in puddle of water, and recognize one of your enemy is creating a shock spell, u can steal the already performed gestures from him to momentarily disable him and force him to start again. Then u can complete the sequence of gestures yourself to cast the shock spell back at him. \n\nMore experienced players will opt to use the stolen gestures to complete a different spell that is more optimal for the situation, since they would have faster spell recognition time and deeper knowledge of the different combinations.\n\nYou can also start casting your own gestures, then recognize one of your enemies is performing  the ending part of your combination, steal it from him to instantly complete your combination and fire the spell.\n\nI believe the skill ceiling here is very high , and does not depend on aim ,but more on deep understanding of the different combinations ,how one spell can change into another, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet me know if this make any sense lol."

In no shape to fight back effectively due to her drug addiction, her best defense is her wits. Running &amp; hiding, she must survive this shadowy killer long enough to hopefully find some escape and/or help. It's not always easy, however, for a hooker to know who to trust or be trusted by others. The stalker is very clever &amp; unpredictable, often using knowledge of the woman's past (including troubled family history) to torture or manipulate her via a series of sick, elaborate mind games.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis figure claims to actually be doing what's best to help her, to *""save""* her. But why her, and what's the endgame? Additionally, her journey through the darkness is plagued by sporadic visual &amp; auditory hallucinations from withdrawal that transform the city and at times people around her into nightmarish perversions. Which of these two will walk away from this cat &amp; mouse to finally see the dawn of tomorrow? And, should this woman finally face her own demons, can she earn forgiveness or perhaps even redemption? That's up to you, as your choices shape how the night plays out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Setting-** Possibly somewhere between the 1980's-90's? It wouldn't be as far back as the 60's, but I'd prefer a time period that supports a noir atmosphere and doesn't have a lot of modern technology to create potential plot holes like *""Why couldn't you use a cell phone, borrow someone's laptop, etc""*.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Genres-** Psychological horror, survival-horror, stealth, crime-thriller, puzzle, choice-driven, noir\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Working Titles (Suggestions Welcome)-** *Dark Trek*, *Dark Trek: Reflection*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gameplay-** Played in 3rd person, you travel from location to location exploring while finding key items to solve narrative &amp; environmental puzzles. Along the way, you will interact with NPC's, make choices, navigate hallucinations, sneak around various threats, and escape the stalker when he/she appears.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Customization-** As you explore levels, you find various items to create your own unique image of the player-character (shoes, boots, gloves, shirts, jackets, coats, leggings, skirts, accessories, etc) which also affects the story. Ex- What you wear changes the stalker's figure and how he/she acts toward you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Characters-** I don't have exact names figured out yet, so we'll just identify the cast as the following:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Lady*\- The protagonist, a 20-something working woman with a dark past and deep trust issues who's struggled with alcohol &amp; drug addiction but is contemplating leaving the business to enter rehab.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Stalker*\- The main antagonist. His/her face is always somehow obscured by darkness (regardless of how lighting changes, which is a narrative clue), and the voice is distorted like Tobin Bell's Jigsaw. Lady initially chalks these strange details up to side-effects from withdrawal. For the majority of the plot, you only see a tall silhouette in a long coat. He/she also gets more disfigured (chiefly in later nightmare levels), depending on your choices. This boogeyman never moves quicker than a fast jog, but is very strong and always seems to be two steps ahead of you even after you've outrun him/her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Crystal*\- Another, more experienced prostitute of similar age who's worked with Lady for years, introduced her to their current pimp, and has contributed to her addiction. Unlike Lady, however, she comes from a far more privileged background with no history of abuse. Sometimes nicknamed *""street sister""*, she's Lady's closest friend and the first person she's opened up to enough to trust since childhood. After having visited and left multiple rehab centers over time, she discourages Lady from it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Donny-* Lady &amp; Crystal's pimp. A 40-something veteran of the streets, he pays their *""salary""* and applies occasional drugs as a reward for a successful night's work but has little patience for drama or mistakes. Lady pleads for Crystal to keep their talk of rehab quiet, as they know exactly how he'd react.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Buster*\- A mildly obese middle-aged divorcee who still wears his wedding ring, refusing to accept responsibility for how he ruined what was already a failing marriage through this weakness for prostitutes. He's one of the first customers to approach Lady the evening her stalker first appears.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Jerry*\- A quiet, but kind introvert who's never had much luck with relationships and cashiers at a convenience store across from the street where Lady often works. Against his better judgment and in spite of numerous warning signs regarding her disorderly life, he's had feelings for Lady since they first met when she entered the store and he caught her about to steal a drink but instead paid for it himself. Always supportive, to the point that he has yet to speak out against her occupation, he does occasionally drop subtle hints in his secret hope that she'll leave that world to get herself help one day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Roger*\- An aged police officer who sometimes patrols the streets where Lady &amp; Crystal work and has arrested both of them before at one time or another. Unfortunately, he could never get anything to stick and was forced to let them off with a warning. Though unapproving and fully willing to lock them up, he has seen many young, abused women die in this city and is sympathetic toward Lady at heart.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Judy-* Lady's long estranged aunt, who took care of her on &amp; off in childhood after one of her parents committed suicide (The choices you make in the story affect which parent fills this role).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Phoner*\- A creepy, but oddly familiar voice that acts independently from the stalker and speaks to Lady at points throughout her journey via calls from various sources at different unconnected locations (cell, phonebooth, old rotary, etc). Whether it's male or female depends on certain choices you make, but both versions share the same personality &amp; dialogue options. This unidentifiable caller has borderline-omniscient knowledge about Lady's movements, choices, and even scarily accurate insight on her thoughts. Ranging from playful to mocking, condescending, apologetic, threatening, cryptic, or flat out not making sense (Your decisions also influence this), the almost schizophrenic sounding phoner's goals are never clear. Nonetheless, he/she can be an uneasy ally to help Lady stay alive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Levels-** Your journey takes you at least halfway across the city between dusk-dawn. This experience wears its *Silent Hill* influence on its sleeve as you explore a dark nightlife thick with eerie fog through varied environments (dilapidated streets, alleyways with occasional branching paths and/or clutter blocking the way, clubs, drug dens, rainy rooftops, abandoned apartments, an understaffed gas station, a scummy parking garage, a near-empty impoverished suburb, subway underground, etc).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWeather changes (rain, thunder &amp; lightning, snow, etc) in a combination of random dynamic shifts during free-roaming + predetermined story moments. The Gothic architecture is colored &amp; stylized similarly to the comic book aesthetic of Telltale's *The Walking Dead* or *The Wolf Among Us*, though not in the same style of animation. Both this and the soundtrack add to the noir tone. Taking inspiration from Akira Yamaoka, music ranges from tranquil to emotional, mysterious, disorienting or haunting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Nightmare Levels-** Just like *Silent Hill*, these episodes of physical/mental stress warp the world into a grotesque (in some cases, more grotesque) caricature. There is no warning sign like a siren, the sky darkening, or other cues. It often happens seemingly at random. Most of these twisted locales are generally characterized by blood, rust, disrepair, barbed wire, things that defy physics and/or logically just shouldn't be there. This includes corpses, childhood memories, and so much more. Some of these transformed levels don't return to normal until after you accomplish a goal like solving a puzzle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLady is in some ways more vulnerable during certain nightmare sequences (Ex- Gradually depleting health). In most such levels, something typically plays with you as many of the themes mess with sight and/or sound (Blurred vision like in *P.T.*'s red looping hallway with the crazy eyes, music playing in reverse, sound effects distorting, controls not responding accurately, the game messaging you, etc). Any NPC's previously present are replaced by deformed monstrosities reflecting Lady's mental state.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Difficulty-** This is set up at the start menu before beginning your playthrough. If enemies, puzzles, or other gameplay aspects are too easy or hard, you can adjust it. Manual saving allows you to reload earlier saves at almost any time, but this can be disabled for conventional checkpoints. Hard mode limits saves, health, and stamina much more while enemies are stronger and timed choices shorter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Content-** Despite its sensationalized/stylized aspects, this is a grounded, mature experience that delves into dark themes: The life &amp; business of prostitution, infidelity, alcoholism, hard drug use, suicide, physical &amp; mental effects of addiction, withdrawal &amp; relapse, rehabilitation, harassment &amp; stalking, emotional &amp; sexual abuse, pedophilia, toxic relationships, violence, and murder. Scenes of sex or other graphic activity would be established or implied, but not explicit to the point of pornography.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTypical death scenes mostly involve Lady blacking out from lack of oxygen (Ex- Being caught &amp; strangled by the stalker or another enemy), but there are more graphic deaths such as being shot, drowned, crushed in an elevator drop, falling from great heights onto rebar, etc. The game won't hold back in unapologetically showing your failures' consequences, emphasizing the need to choose wisely.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Choices-** These include timed branching dialogue choices, what path to take in certain levels (often during chases, such as when to hide vs. run), and timed ethical decisions at plot-critical moments.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Survival-** Health functions much like in *Silent Hill* or *Resident Evil*, signified by a colored *""vital signs""* graphic viewable in the menu (or, optionally, in a small onscreen hud at either of the bottom screen corners). Changes in weather also affect your body temperature throughout. To avoid losing health and/or stamina during these periods, you must find, exchange, purchase, or steal appropriate clothing along with matches to start fires as needed. Stamina governs running &amp; combat, but is also limited (partially by withdrawal). Overexertion blurs vision and makes you move slower from lack of breath.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Stealth-** Sneaking is affected by many ever changing factors throughout, including footstep noise and tracks. Changes in weather impact sneaking like a puzzle in itself (Creaky floors making footsteps louder, water, blood, and snow leaving tracks, lightning giving away your location if you're caught in the flashes, etc). If/when stealth fails and you are caught in the open, you must flee. The mechanics in this mainly take influence from *Silent Hill: Shattered Memories*, *Downpour*, and *Resident Evil 2*'s remake.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nChases take some small influence from *Shattered Memories*. Mastering the environment is crucial, as objects &amp; obstacles can be used to slow your pursuer. Some combat is allowed, but usually not ideal. If caught in a grab, this can stun you or lead to choking animations that drain health. You can't overpower the stalker or other enemies, but can stun them (Throwing objects, swinging a chair or 2x4, exploiting traps, etc). Lastly, collecting a limited number of self-defense items with varying durability (Knife, scissors, glass shard) allows you to instantly escape when grabbed without damage.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Puzzles-** Apart from free-roaming environmental puzzles, there are character-driven obstacles in which you must make the right choices in dialogue for your desired outcome. Failing at this usually won't end the game, but will close the door to certain paths while possibly causing new obstacles/dangers to appear. Some choices affect nightmare puzzles too, such as where/when they happen. But the scariest riddles are created by the stalker, showing the depth if his/her obsession.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn specific areas, you discover something he/she constructed from a memory in your past. Ex- One room in a nasty building that's spotlessly clean looks like an exact replica of Lady's childhood home's living room, complete with the same type of couch &amp; TV (emitting static) and mannequins modeled after her parents, matching their likeness down to the smallest details. These life-sized dioramas always have a theme, riddle, plot connection, and a potential clue to the stalker's true identity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEach one is set up like an escape room that must be completed to progress to the next level, with cameras the stalker uses to watch Lady from an unknown location and some form of message (letter, recording, writing in blood, etc) disguising hints, very much like Jigsaw. Solutions include using one or more key items found throughout the level, items already set up in the room, manipulating lighting, and other activities. Some obstacles are timed once you begin, but there are no death traps if you fail.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLike stealth, combat, and dialogue, puzzles often have multiple possible solutions, allowing some flexibility in players' approach to different situations. Be aware, however, that the solution you implement can potentially affect the ending. Morality factors into some of these as well. Ex- Will you solve a challenge by finding a hidden item, or make it easier to progress by sacrificing someone else? A few hints also come in the form of calls from the mysterious phoner, who sometimes conveys cryptic messages during your dialogues to nudge Lady in a more productive direction.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Plot-** An introductory cutscene shows Lady walking down a rainy alley at night, until a shadowy figure appears (This is the silhouette of a gender-neutral enemy with no discernible features, not the stalker you encounter later). She questions who it is and what he/she wants, but gets no reply. As he/she slowly picks up step in their approach, fast-walking with eerie body language, Lady curses at him/her to get away before turning to start running. This cutscene skips ahead in time to begin a stealth tutorial when Lady hides inside a grimy building only for the figure to break in and patrol the area.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe/she calls Lady's name in a low, distorted voice (not the voice the stalker uses). Even if you sneak perfectly though, she is inevitably caught before reaching the exit, after which you complete a combat tutorial by stunning the enemy with a grabbed item of your choice. Succeeding at this leads to Lady escaping by crashing out a window. Falling one story onto the dumpster below, she rolls off to the ground and lands in a dirty puddle. Struggling to stand on an injured ankle, she limps away in audible pain. The initially light rain worsens as she moves deeper into the increasingly labyrinthian alleyways.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCommenting on how she can't make any sense of where she is despite having lived in this city for years, Lady once again hears the pursuer not far behind and has nowhere to go but forward (Every door she tries is locked, and nobody hears her cries for help). The environment around you then starts changing into a nightmare (homaging Harry Mason's walk through town at the beginning of *Silent Hill*, after the first siren blares): The sky gets darker, the chain-link fences grow rusted, the rain &amp; puddles turn to the color of blood. Items appear in the streets that look out of place (Ex- A spotless chair).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese represent childhood memories that aren't yet understood, but will make sense in story context later via the stalker's puzzles. The music similarly becomes progressively off-key and unnerving. Coming upon a covered corpse, Lady lifts the bloodstained sheet to see the face of her friend Crystal. She screams, limping faster only to reach a wall of interlinked barbed wire blocking her way. A second corpse (suspiciously dressed identically to her) hangs here, strung up by barbed wire in a crucified pose. Shaking with fear, Lady reluctantly looks closer in a brief pause and realizes this body is her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPanicking, she then turns to see the shadowy figure emerge from the darkness behind her. She makes one last attempt to run, but the path behind them has changed to another dead end. No matter what you do, the enemy eventually catches up and strangles Lady until she blacks out. Waking up gasping for air in bed, she takes a moment to look around the room while feeling her throat. Crystal rushes in, having heard Lady's outburst, and asks if she's all right. Remembering where she is, safe &amp; sound in their crappy shared apartment, she sighs and assures Crystal that she's fine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMuttering that it must have just been a bad dream, she catches her breath and is offered a drink. Crystal then tells her friend that she's slept all day since they got back from partying last night and they have to start getting ready soon. Their pimp Donny is expecting them for work tonight, and they don't want to piss him off by being late again. Nodding, Lady shakes off fatigue and gets dressed. Checking her neck for bruises in the mirror, she's told to hurry and grabs her purse before following Crystal out the door. They share more dialogue while walking downstairs to Donny's club.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nChecking in with him, he sends them on their way outside and Crystal asks Lady to buy her some cigarettes from the convenience store across the street. Accepting this leads to Lady visiting Jerry, who engages in dialogue. Her first moral choice involves whether to buy the cigarettes or steal them and get something she wants. Regardless of how this interaction concludes or whether it occurs at all, time skips again to Lady &amp; Crystal waiting together at their usual spot for the evening's first customers. Their conversation includes the options to discuss where they are in life and/or debate rehabilitation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShortly afterward, one of their regulars arrives in his typical inebriated fashion. Buster offers his paycheck for quality time with one of his favorite gals, presenting the next choice: Will you go with him, let Crystal go, or have them both turn Buster away? Either way, the night progresses a couple-few hours until Lady is back on the same street. Spotting a mysterious, yet strangely familiar car passing, Lady scoffs to herself at how this jerk's *""window shopped""* on &amp; off for weeks now but never gives any business. Unable to see the driver, she has the option to flip him off before taking a break and leaving.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGiving her night's profits to Donny (His reaction and how much he lets you keep is determined by whether you went with Buster), she sits for a minute and is offered another drink. The unseen driver's car enters her peripheral vision again. If you sit too long, Donny chastises you to quit lagging and get back out there. Lady comments that it looks like it will rain tonight, to which he apathetically suggests that she bring a coat or buy an umbrella. Taking whatever she's made thus far, she obeys and exits the club to find Crystal who comments on the outcome of whatever you decided regarding Buster.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFeeling the urge to urinate, but not wanting to go back in and get an earful from Donny, Lady asks her friend to cover for her while she quickly runs off to find a restroom. Crystal's reaction is affected by your decision with Buster, but you are able to leave regardless. Taking off, Lady has options on where to go (Behind the alley, in her &amp; Crystal's favorite local club away from Donny, or the store where you can convince Jerry to let you use the Employees Only restroom around the far back). The next cutscene shows her leaving whichever location you chose only to find that the rain is getting heavier.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis feels eerily similar to her dream, putting her on edge. Eager to get back to Crystal, Lady trudges through the rain but finds her path blocked by a car in the distance. A silhouette wearing a long coat steps out and begins approaching much like the figure from her nightmare. You can offer him/her your money, threaten him with a bluff (despite having no weapons), or offer Lady's *""services""* in exchange for him/her to get her out of the rain. Either way, the figure continues forward without a word. Frightened, Lady flees into the alleys only to somehow get turned around just like in the dream.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThus, the chase is on. Running, hiding, and fighting for her life, Lady attempts (and fails) to get help multiple times at different locations while discovering and being forced to solve the stalker's puzzles. However many times she escapes though, this entity inexplicably seems to know where she'll go next, always reappearing later no matter how fast or far she runs as if by teleportation. Her worst fears manifest in every new nightmare &amp; challenge, and some NPC's you meet can become an ally or foe.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis white-knuckle hunt's climax leads to a final puzzle, then a twist reminiscent of *Silent Hill 2* or *Dead Space* wherein everything becomes clear: Lady is insane. Almost nothing she's experienced up to now has been real and she's been running aimlessly around the city, suffering hallucinations and fits of hysteria thanks to withdrawal from substance abuse. In the process, long suppressed memories of her past have boiled to the surface, haunting her to the point of creating dangerous stress on her brain.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGuilt over a past wrong has eaten her up inside for years, a secret even Crystal doesn't know. Everything about her current life has been her way of trying to avoid it. The stalker personifies the core of this repressed trauma, the puzzles &amp; phoner having all been fractured bits of her subconscious pushing progressively vivid memories to the forefront. Now, there's nowhere left to run. After one last confrontation, the stalker's face is revealed. What you do next is the final choice to end Lady's arc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Endings-** This is affected by factors like clues &amp; collectibles found, hidden areas explored, how certain puzzles are solved, specific dialogue choices, moral choices, difficulty level, and how much overall time + effort you put into the game. The more you invest in the journey, the better an ending you will earn:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Ending A*\- The stalker is revealed as Lady's father, and she remembers how he abused her in childhood. Following her mother's suicide after a long battle with depression, this alcoholic monster took advantage of her repeatedly. Worse, he guilt-tripped her over time into believing it was her own fault. Adding that confessing to anybody would break what was left of their family as well as disappoint her late mom, this all created a deep sense of self-loathing within Lady. The only refuge in this child's life was her aunt Judy, but she could never bring herself to speak out despite clear signs of abuse.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBy the time Judy became suspicious enough to call Child Protective Services, Lady had already run away. Hitchhiking from one place to the next, accepting help from more people who took advantage of her, this pattern continued until the child made it to this city. Soon after, she'd meet Crystal and be given shelter, eventually convinced by this already veteran prostitute to join her profession as a means of income. Reasoning that sex for money couldn't be too hard since she already had some *""experience""*, this was the beginning of what would become Lady's new normal. Now, here she is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll these years later, the guilt instilled by her father's abuse has followed her. He was always with her, even when she couldn't see him. Deep down, some part of her still felt that she deserved it, that she needed someone to punish her for everything she'd done up to now. But that's all over, as Lady chooses to spare the stalker instead of killing him and talks to the specter of her father. With all her strength, she accepts the past while also renouncing him as nothing but a memory. Taking back all the power he ever had over her, she voices aloud that she will never forget but does forgive him. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe forgives not for his sake, but for her own. With that, she can finally move on. Tears of relief fall down Lady's cheeks as she watches the boogeyman disappear and the nightmare fade. Feeling the warmth of the early sunrise, she walks back to her &amp; Crystal's apartment and finds her friend passed out in her bed. Grabbing a couple things, Lady leaves a small goodbye note thanking Crystal for taking her in (pleading that she say nothing to Donny, to buy her some time until she's far away). She then sneaks across the street to the convenience store, making sure nobody from Donny's club sees her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSeeing how messed up she looks, Jerry immediately reacts with concern but Lady calms him before asking one last favor. After sitting down in the back of the store to talk, he ditches work and sneaks her into his car. Lending her some money for a change of clothes at the nearest shop, Jerry takes her a couple hours out of the city to the only place she wants to go: A rehab center. A few weeks later, Lady completes the program and leaves in much better shape with Jerry waiting outside to congratulate her (having kept in touch with her via scheduled supervised phone calls).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanking him with a hug and kiss on the cheek, she requests change for a payphone to call her aunt. Speaking for the first time in years, after so many failed attempts at contact, Judy is relieved to hear Lady's voice and that she wants to come home for a fresh start. Agreeing to pick her up, she makes the trip and arrives another couple hours later. Seeing that Lady looks healthy, she introduces herself to Jerry before breaking down, dropping her purse and pulling her niece in for a mutually emotional embrace. The camera pans out on these three with the sun shining through a haze of clouds.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(**Note:** If you made choices that resulted in the stalker's figure/voice being female, this exact same ending can transpire with the roles of Lady's mother &amp; father reversed. In other words, the father would've committed suicide while the mother abused her. In either case, Judy's role is the same)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Ending B*\- Lady kills the stalker, cries in relief, and walks off as the dawn comes. Reuniting with Jerry at the convenience store, she thanks him for always being there for her and expresses how she wants to get help so they can make a fresh start together. However hard a road it may be, she's done with this life. Convinced, Jerry packs a few things before the two exit the store and leave in his car. Holding hands at a stoplight, she reciprocates his supportive smile with a loving kiss. The light turns green, and they ride out of the city under the morning sun, the camera panning out as they cross a bridge.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Ending C*\- Lady kills the stalker, who is revealed to be Roger. Coming to her senses, she remembers that he followed her after spotting her walking alone in the rain. Recognizing her, he called out multiple times offering to help but she hallucinated him as the shadow from her dreams partially due to the mental effects of withdrawal. Running into a drug den, she was nearly assaulted by three men while a female junkie cheered them on from the background (Two of these four total voices, male &amp; female, were the phoner). Roger intervened to save Lady, but she was in hysterics by that point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen he kneeled down in attempt to calm her before she hurt herself, she mistook him for one of the would-be-assailants. Following a brief altercation in the pouring rain, she grabbed his gun and pulled the trigger. Initially believing it was self-defense, the unstable Lady slowly realizes what she's done. Crying, heaving, and panicking, she hides the gun in her pocket and loots Roger's wallet before leaving his body in the rain. Hailing a cab, she pays the driver to take her as far outside the city as he can. A couple cabs later, she finds herself in the next town over with night falling once again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBuying a few things at the nearest store before renting a room at a local motel, she then cuts &amp; dyes her hair to make herself less recognizable before turning on the TV to watch for news of Roger's reported murder. Consumed with regret for having killed a good man that only ever felt sorry for her, Lady takes out his gun again and holds it tightly in both hands while rocking back and forth on the bed. Her choices have not only ruined her life, but now taken another's. She is alone. The camera pans out the window as the poor woman continues crying, showing the motel as more heavy rain falls.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Ending D*\- Lady kills the stalker, but realizes it was Donny. She then remembers him yelling at her &amp; Crystal before she left that night after overhearing them speaking of rehab. Insisting that Lady was one of his top money makers, he irrationally threatened to hunt her down if she ever tried to leave. Despite Crystal's efforts to cover for her after she left to find a restroom, Donny's paranoia led him to believe she ran away. Striking Crystal in retaliation, he took his car to make good on his promise of hunting Lady. When Lady saw him, however, she hallucinated him as the shadow from her dreams.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFollowing a final altercation after he caught up to her, she managed to grab his gun. Roger follows the sound and catches Lady with Donny's blood on her hands. Believing her claims of self-defense but bound by law to arrest her regardless, he takes her downtown. Despite him making her case to his superior, she's still charged for prostitution + suspected murder (investigation pending). Sitting in a cell, Lady faces an uncertain future but is adamant about being done with the streets. Slowly raising her tear-stained eyes with runny makeup, she stares at the camera closing in until it fades to black.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Ending E*\- Lady and the stalker kill each other. The nightmare then flashes to reality, and Lady's revealed to have overdosed that night after doing drugs with a customer who then abandoned her. The whole game was her brain's swan song before shutting down (The phoner's voices being from specific NPC's she met). Her body's found in a puddle by Roger the next morning. Shaking his head in sadness with a sigh, he reports yet another case of an all too familiar story. The camera closes in on Lady's lifeless face, one tear shown dripping amidst the water on her corpse, before fading to black.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Ending F (Secret Ending)*\- Lady kills the stalker before waking up in her bed in a very similar manner to the beginning of the game. Crystal similarly walks in to investigate the noise and comforts her friend, chuckling that she found Lady passed out at their favorite local club last night after she'd left to find a restroom. It turns out that the stalker's face &amp; voice were a manifestation of the bartender (The phoner's voices were certain patrons sitting in the bar with her). While she was lost in her intoxicated nightmare, Crystal brought her home and talked Donny down from taking his anger out on her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe was apparently pissed that she ran off before finishing work last night, and they're both expected to make up for it. Lady sighs in relief, taking something for her hangover before Crystal tells her that they have to start getting ready for their shift tonight. Going through the same montage of getting dressed and checking herself in the mirror, she prepares to follow Crystal out. She briefly turns back with a look of uncertainty &amp; regret, wondering if she still wants this life. When Crystal asks what's wrong while waiting, Lady snaps out of it and replies *""... Nothing...""* before closing her bedroom door."
k8u2gz,Please Help me with this battle system I am gonna make.,"I am currently working on a 2d game where the player is a circle and has hp and damage, but it fights with other circles who might be other shapes as well, with different speed and size values. I need ideas for the battles. If they shoot something, things like size and speed will be pointless (and there are a few enemies who have shooting abilities). If they ""consume"" each other like [agar.io](https://agar.io), again the size and speed will be pointless and there should be a consuming priority like if two circles crash into each other, who will deal damage. If you say both can, then fast but low health enemies will die and their speed will be useless. If they hurt through ""spikes"" around them some who have spikes in certain parts will be useless cause if I have just one spike and the other has 1000 at their back, I should unfairly win.

k8u1t2,FPS tower defense game where you are stranded on an island in the Bermuda Triangle.,"So after working on a multiplayer game set in space, I want to work on a single player game as my side project sort of. In the game you play as a soldier whose ship gets completely destroyed by an unknown force. \n\nYou find yourself on a small island which has weird technology on it. It seems like someone once inhabited the island like some sort of militia but they are nowhere to be found. You need to take over a building/base and start adding defenses to it. The will have a huuge emphasis on the traps and how traps work with each other. Example: you want to use freeze traps paired with cannons to obliterate enemies. The enemies themselves are undead creatures which derived from the sea. \n\nAs you progress through the game unlocking weapons and exploring the island, you come across a tube system that can take you to other islands like the one you are on. Those other islands can have cities, towns where there are tougher enemies. The main starting island acts as your home base and as you progress the undead entities become stronger. Game is heavily inspired by fortnite:Save The World but an FPS low poly perspective.  \n\nLmk any ideas you have that would make cool mechanics! I’m talking core gameplay loop here!"

Different spiders have different stats (Spider stats are: Speed, Web Quality {Which effects stickiness, which determines how hard it is to escape the web}, Web Speed {Which determines how much web you can spin at a certain speed}, and Web Capacity {How much web they can produce at once before having to eat a fly}.)\n\nAnd then there are flies. You must avoid the spiders, and you have a advantage: Flying. You cant fly for too long, without eating food left around the map , but if you are walking, spiders are faster. Also, if you get stuck in a web, you have to struggle to get out. Different Fly stats are: Flying (How well the fly can...well, fly.), strength (How fast flies can escape webs), Health (How long it takes to get eaten, you can escape if you are fast enough, but its hard), and things like that (No idea what else.) Also, the fly team doesnt have to be limited to just flies. Maybe bees, or beetles, etc.\n\nThere would be different maps, maybe all set in the different places in a house. Little scraps of food will be set around, which the fly team can eat to regain energy to fly. Spiders must eat flies from the fly team to continue spinning webs. Spiders get points from eating flies, flies get points from eating food scraps, and escaping webs (escaping webs gives more points, to sort of attract the fly team to them)\n\nAnd you can make it so if you die, you die for the rest of the round, or you respawn, etc. You can also change the win conditions, like whoever has the most points by the end of the round, or flies must stay alive until the end, etc.\n\nAlso, the webs are hard to see as a fly. And maybe, if flying is too OP for flies, maybe all spiders can have the venom-spit ability? Or the jump ability? Or, the more flies are eaten, the higher the stats of the spider becomes (Just for that round).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDoes that seem like a solid idea? Constructive Criticism isnt a issue. I tried to make it small, understandable, and relatively easy."
k8nx04,Sewer tycoon plus supervilain manager,"So basicaly in this game, you would play for a villaneous CEO of a company in charge of maintaining city sewer system. Your goal would be to get as many money to enlarge canalisation system while breeding many monstrous mutants, creating secret chambers and possibly hidden weapons under city. There would be few superheroes which you could either try to get rid of or move the public opinion against them by secretly pulling the strings before them getting to know about your plans. The game could include a little bit of intrigues, shady economy and politics. Perhaps you could also publish your own sewer themed newspaper (sewer tribune) pushing your agenda and denigrate uncomfortable people. Also the city could be called Mudham, Bogham, Marshham, Gutterham or something simmilar. The game would be meaned to be parody on superhero genre and humorous tycoon."

k8gak7,H.P. Lovecraft's inspired game,"Hi everyone, big fan of Lovecraft here. Lately i have been thinking about making a small game about it ( i am a programmer and learning 3d modeling / painting ), the basic idea is: \n\nEach level is inspired by a Lovecraft's tale (The Shadow over Innsmouth, Dunwhich's Horror, The Colour Out of Space etc.) and it's completely independent. The player has to ""complete"" the scene within a certain amount of time, by going around, talking with NPC and solving puzzles (finding stuff and basic logic/numeric puzzles). If he manages to solve the level, he goes to the next.\n\nDo you think it would be fun even for non-fans of the writer? does it relay too much on the art style to be actually interesting?"

Schuyler Miller](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/952333.P_Schuyler_Miller) called The Sands of Time. What if an eccentric billionaire from modern age hires a down on his luck mercenary to test his prototype time machine, and he gets stranded in the Cretaceous age with the machine broken down? He will have to survive the hungry, fanged predators who romped through the earth in this savage age, find food and shelter and make use of his limited resources cleverly. Things won't be made easier by the revelation that the princess of a distant planet has hidden here, pursued by another alien race that wants to sacrifice her to their monstrous god. Open world, of course, and first person. This is my idea...now free for suggestions."
k8c3up,"""Rogue-like"" Civilization survival","You lead a small isolated civilisation which needs to survive say 400 years. It might be, e.g.\n- A spaceship crrew finding a new home\n- A bunker community waiting for the fallout to end\n\nApart from keeping the basic stuff running, electricity, food, tools, a key challenge is: keeping the community stable. A revolt will end it.\n\nThere are fractions: Growers, Engineers, Scientists, Transporters, Security, Hard Labour, (Navigators)\n\nNow you can't give them everything they want, there is not enough room for too many children for example. \n\nHow to control that?\nIntroduce a Lottery system?\nSecretly but birth control into water?\n    These are just examples.\n\nWhy I call it roguelike:\n- short runs that often fail\n- you take nothing to the next run\n- you only progress through own skill"
k8axpx,"Taking a page from Breath of the Wild, a lonely open world cyber-zombie-apocalypse game without waypoints or markers. It's just you waking up, exploring and piecing together environmental clues to uncover what happened, in search for any living human (if they even exist at all).","So I replayed SOMA recently (don't worry, no spoilers) and realized it kinda shares the same core premise with BotW of waking up in an unrecognizable world in ruins.\n\nAll you know at the start is that, due to a fatal illness, you were put into cryosleep until doctors could discover a cure.\n\nLike BotW, you are dropped into a world without waypoints; the only objectives you have are ones you give to yourself. Somewhere early and nearby you find an abandoned campfire in which some canned food was recently cooked, implying there must at least be one human somewhere in this world. It's a gentle nudge by the game to make you give yourself the goal of finding people, which the player doesn't know is actually the true, final goal of the game.\n\nHere are things you slowly start to gather about what happened to the world while you slept:\n* Technology advanced to the point nearly all people were enhanced with cybernetics, the most common of which were neuraltech that let them interface with computers directly.\n* Those cybernetic upgrades might be how you can do superhuman things you never could before, and how you're able to fend of zombies. Speaking of which...\n* At some point a hybrid virus started turning people into zombies that would further spread the infection. These are the common zombies you fight in the game, although some humans who had cyber enhancements before being infected are even more dangerous types of zombies.\n* The majority of people disabled or physically removed their brain implants to become immune, so they at least wouldn't turn into zombies if attacked.\n* Humans created humanoid combat drones to fight the zombies, but they required human pilots who still have their neuraltech. These people have to ""full dive"" into the drones to pilot them from a remote location.\n* When you find the desolate terminal station from which these pilots operated, you learn the base was overrun by zombies and most of the bodies of the pilots were turned. This is what led to the dangerous combat androids you find in the overworld or the boss-level monsters you find in some locations.\n* Upon trying to disconnect one of these zombie pilots from the base's boss-level defense android that's attacking you, you learn it doesn't stop the android. Thus, they weren't actually remote piloting; they were actually transferring their minds.\n* Humanity dwindled after that last line of defense broke. However, the few that remained became quite proficient at fighting zombies. A few broke off in search of new ways to stop the zombies and save the world once and for all... one of these people might be the person you're tracking.\n\nI suppose you might already see what twists reveals lie ahead for the player, but to the player this would all unravel slowly. *Lore galore.*"
k8ag66,"As a fan of Japanese history, I have an idea that I think would be cool","I recently finished the book “Shogun” and somehow fell into a rabbit hole during my Latin class. Apparently, “Shogun” was based off of a real event. Back in 1600, an English pilot by the name of William Adams crashed in Japan. His goal there was to end the Portuguese monopoly on Japanese trade, but instead, he got caught up in their politics, and after three years, he became the first foreign samurai/daimyo, and a close ally with the Shogun. I think it would be really cool to see a story type game based on these events. I know this doesn’t give many details,  but I think this could be a really interesting game."

k8ac79,A one time experience where...,"You crash land on a beautiful planet that resembles Earth. Your crew is dead and you are stranded with nothing but a tool that allows you to build and fully customize a portable base that you can move anywhere at anytime. As you continue, you meet an adorable creature that follows you around and keeps you company. You also have a basic AI friend that gives you tasks and tips on what to do. After a about thirty or forty minutes of playing, randomly during the night you will hear a loud explosion in the distance. The AI directs you to immediately retreat to your base, where a cutscene follows. There is fire everywhere, and you grab your portable base tool thing and put your base in your pocket (or something) and run. The screen fades black and the cutscene ends. You wake up in a different environment and no fire in sight. After setting your base down, you’ll notice that your pet has gone missing, presumably perished in the fire. Basically, the game is that you are always outrunning this fire and trying to figure out a way to leave the planet before you are consumed. You meet a variety of creatures along the way, most of which eventually perish from this fire one way or another. You eventually build a space vessel that you plan to evacuate you and your remaining pets. However, during your ascent to space a fatal malfunction occurs with the engines that forces you the eject from the ship, and you’re forced to watch your only means of survival literally blow up in your face, along with your last remaining pets. You have a parachute, but below you all you can see is a destroyed ecosystem ravaged by fire. A final cutscene/flashback occurs when you were still on the spaceship from the beginning of the game, before you crash landed. You are flying the ship with your co pilot, but during this flashback you realize that you pushed a button that eventually caused your crash that killed your crew. Another flashback takes place on the ground, as you walk away from the wreckage of your spaceship. The camera zooms in on the wreckage, and you notice that fuel is leaking from the ship, that eventually caused the explosion heard in the beginning. Yeah basically during this final flashback you learn that you caused the crash that killed your crew, which then caused fuel leakage that resulted in an explosion and the fire that you are running from the entire game, the same fire that killed all of your adorable companions along the way. Idk man I’d play it"

You, now alone, have to find food, water, and other materials to survive, as well as fight off any threats.

Any other features you think should be included, feel free to leave a comment."
k85afo,A VR Turn Based RPG,"I'll try to keep it simple.\n\nThe home world is like an interactive tavern where you can go to a bulletin board and choose a bounty (a type of monster) that offers a reward (exp and gold).\n\nOnce the bounty is chosen you will choose 3 of the same or a variation of 4 characters:\nSwordsman (No magic)\nWhite mage (Heals and protects with magic)\nBlack mage (Attacks and buffs with elemental and status magic)\nRanged (what's VR without guns, kind of the same as swordsman but can hit weak points easier and could have less health)\n\nYou are then transported to the battle just like FF and the music starts. Think of a traditional final fantasy battle. Enemies (1-5) on one side, you and your allies (3 including you) on the other. 6 positions (3 front, 3 rear decided before battle).\n\nEach character has a HP and an ATB gauge. Mages have a MP that slowly recharges. Swordsman and Ranged have a limit break gauge that slowly fills as they land attacks or get hit. Limit breaks would be more complicated forms of regular attacks (mentioned later) that afflict more damage.\n\nBattle menus show finite useable items (purchased with gold) for healing health and status. Mages can also select spells.\n\nAttacking with the swordsman and Ranged is kind of similar. For the swordsman you select attack and are either launched toward the enemy or teleported depending on your preference (motion sickness) where you can then slash in a small time frame. Long arc slashes do more damage (like the point system in beat saber) rather than rapidly shaking your wrist around.\nFor ranged after you select attack you don't move rather targets appear that need to be shot in succession increasing a multiplier. Missing resets the multiplier. There is also a timeframe.\nFor white mage you select a spell (heal, protect, haste etc) from the menu and which ally to cast on. A pattern is shown depending on the spell that needs to be traced with the controller. An accurate tracing heals for more or protects for longer and an inaccurate tracing still heals or protects just not as much or for as long.\nSame goes for black mage (fire, ice, poison etc) but for damage. Black mages can also buff the damage dealers weapons for some neat combinations.\n\nChanging character positions is as easy as pointing at an empty marker and teleporing to it. Front and rear positions were always confusing to me because why wouldn't you always put your ranged in the back line? Well you still will but with this you can place a character in front of a low health character to tank a little till they can be healed. Maybe some AOE magic or special attacks can dissuade all the characters from bunching up all the time.\n\nWhen the battle is won. You are given exp and gold which you can spend to improve character stats and restock useable items. With each bounty complete the next will unlock and it gets more challenging from there. If things get too hard you can return to older bounties to farm exp and gold.\n\nI liked the gambit system so you had some control over the AI. People liked that a lot about. Combat can be controlled manually and programmed via the use of gambits; manually entered commands take precedence and their immediate execution will interrupt gambit programming. Eg cast heal when ally HP &lt;30%.\n\nI thought about multiplayer having a friend/s control unused character but I haven't thought about it that much. They'd come in to help but you'd still get the rewards.\n\nWhat do you think?"

k7qqom,The Corruption: Hunted by hell,I have a book series called The Corruption and in the first book there is a demonic invasion and the idea I had was if you got to play as a normal human who wants to survive where you would have to sneak through buildings so you wouldn't be found and killed by the demons and zombies roaming around and you would have a certain amount of time to get through each building and you can't make to much noise and you can't be seen. The demons have red eyes so you can see if they are looking in your direction but the zombies you can only hear because its late at night and the only light you get is from the windows because with the demonic invasion the sky was made red/orange. There would be demon variants and zombie variants to make it more difficult. There would be 19 levels and each level would take 5-30 minutes.
k7p5jb,A Home-Alone Styled Horror Game,"# ABOUT\n\n*You're relaxing in your home until you receive an anonymous phone call. The person warns you that within 3 hours (30 minutes real time), a group of henchmen will attempt to break in to your home and kidnap you. It is your task to fortify your home with traps and survive until next morning.* \n\n# Gameplay\n\nThe game would have two main settings: the afternoon and the night.\n\nAFTERNOON: Whilst you would be able to lock your doors and close your windows, it wouldn't be enough to protect yourself. The afternoon would be a sandbox-like experience where you will gather resources in your home to create elaborate traps. Pre-built traps like a bucket on a door, or a trip wire would be available to you, but you could also create your own traps. Ultimately, you would have enough freedom to create traps like in the movie *Home Alone:* [*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atYjWYoS0Hk*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atYjWYoS0Hk)\n\nNIGHT: The night is where the horror aspect would unfold. The main form of horror used would be  paranoia and suspense. Spooky soundtracks will only be introduced if the player was to actually encounter a henchman. Otherwise it would be dead-silent. A good example is this one part in *Duck Season:* (skip to 2:24) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtK2kiMJ4Xs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtK2kiMJ4Xs). Relying strictly on sound is where the paranoia sets in, as floorboards creaking might either be the henchmen or the house. I think the game *Visage* is the perfect example of what I mean. Your character would also react to sudden sounds and events through his breathing or heartbeat, like in *Outlast.* I also think it would be cool if your character would shake and change postures depending on how scared he was. In terms of art style, I wouldn't have it scream horror to you, but rather let the player determine whether or not they are in a scary situation. For example, the game would look rather cartoony like *Firewatch.* The trick is to surprise them with horror. A good example of what I mean is in the game *Subnautica*: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87nMEZE5s-g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87nMEZE5s-g)\n\n# Story\n\nI haven't thought of much regarding story, but here's an idea: the anonymous caller was you but from a different universe. Somehow you and your alternate version switched universes and are now being tracked down by elite units (henchmen) to investigate and exterminate."

Now the game could be waved based, a campaign, an open world adventure, its up to you, but an added feature would be the ability to control houses after defeating _______ and then be able to set up stationary machine guns, cameras, and what not from it. \n\nI would recommend something like a World War Z kind of game, and to be able to play with a squad max of 4, and with different weapon types for a certain player.\n\nThanks I hope this gives some inspiration, and if you do make it, I would like a copy please."
k7gep7,VR Sickness Trainer,"I'm proposing a collection of mini-games which test people's resilience to VR sickness, help them overcome it via controlled exposure and/or understand what type of games will be accessible to them. If people consent their data could help developers decide how to configure their games to minimize nausea and which accessibility settings to implement.\n\nThe games will each contain different elements known to influence VR sickness and configure them to the appropriate level for the person using them. Periodically the games will ask for feedback from players about how they feel and use this data to adjust  the experience and prevent nasea getting to unacceptable levels. \n\nThe challenging part would be keeping it engaging. Most of all there would need to be a decent verity of mini games which are all fun in their own right. Tracking of achievements and positive reinforcement when players reach a new level of intensity or endurance could also help keep players coming back."

k70q6w,Metal Gear Solid Ghost Babel × R.U.R.,"  Bit of background, R.U.R. is a stage play written by Karel Capek in 1920-21. It's widely credited with being the first work of literature to coin the word, ""robot."" Although that may not neccesarily be true, (I've heard that Tesla beat Capek for first person to use the word by a couple of years,) it did popularise the idea of robots and machine consciousness throughout the mainstream media and is, I think at at least, a pretty neat play all around.\n  Granted, being a stage play written in the 20s, it's really short, (you could easily read through it in a couple of hours if you're a slow reader,) and leaves a lot of things open to interpretation. I've been interested in the play for a while and the idea of doing my own take on the story for a while now, (think the multiple Great Gatsby films, or like what The Protomen did with Megaman's story, but through a videogame instead.) I'd take more time to branch out from Domin and the other R.U.R managers to explore Rossum's backstory and the history of the founding of his company, R.U.R, the effects of manufacturable labour on both the world economy and the global war economy, (think Metal Gear Solid 4 &amp; 5,) and of course the real question, ""Do robots dream of electric sheep?"" Lol. And because of that, I think it'd best to approach this type of idea through an updated/modern version of the 2d MGS games.\n\nTL;DR here's my idea for a shitty robot fanfic game, any feedback?"
k6zy8k,A game where you manage and play as gladiators in the Roman coleseum,"You’d start off by buying inexperienced fighters, who you’d train on different abilities and equip different weapons and armor. Maybe some could focus on speed while others focus on strength, etc. Once you go out to fight, you’d play as whatever gladiator you selected, and their training and equipment carried over in the form of stat boosts. The more they win the more game they have, fighting stronger opponents and earning more money, maybe even being speed after losing if the public likes you enough. If they are famous enough you can even sell them or retire them to use as trainers, multiplying the speed new recruits are trained. However, in order to retire they have to fight the hardest battle in the game, a fight against a mythical enemy from various world mythologies. The harder the final enemy, the better your legacy will be, which will benefit you by having new recruits start off with more fame just by being trained by the retired fighter. You could also hire more experienced gladiators, with the downside that you need to constantly pay them to keep them working for you. You could fight 1 on 1 battles with an experienced opponent, 1 v many weaker opponents at the same time, fighting either 1 or many animals, like lions, crocodiles, tigers, etc. And finally free for all, where the last fighter alive wins and animals are released periodically to keep you on your toes."

As you play you realize strange creatures are in the woods and hunting you down, and you must find a way to escape.\n\n**GAME CONCEPT**\n\nThe game starts off with you in the mechanic, standing around your car. Depending on the difficulty setting, the players will be given: a flashlight, a backpack, a couple of batteries, a map, a pistol, some bullets, and a walkie-talkie. Depending on your difficulty will determine which and how many items you are given at the start.\n\nThe aim of the game is to explore the woods and try to escape. You must use the walkie-talkie, flashlight, map, and anything you find along the way to help you. But there are multiple ways you can escape.\n\n1. **The Car-**\n\na. Probably the simplest way to escape, as you already have the car and parts are found in the mechanics. There are some pieces and tools that you have to explore, but the mechanics are like a safe house so when you’re repairing it you are safe. Once you repair it though, it will make lots of noise and attract the monsters. Someone must also open the garage, which is slow, so it gives the monsters time to come. Afterward, they must quickly get into the car and the player drives the car. They have to know the right roads to take because the monsters will be chasing them and they can break the glass and kill you.\n\n2. **The Lift-**\n\na. The lift is the lift that will take you up the mountain, far away from the monsters. This is the safest option, but it takes the longest, as you’ll spend a lot of time finding tools and pieces to repair everything. The engine for it is broken so you will have to find a manual to repair it. Then you will have to find the parts and tools to repair it. You must also repair the communications tower to contact someone to pick you up there.\n\n3. **The Boat-**\n\na. In terms of time length, the boat escape is the easiest. Though it is challenging as you must travel through the swamp. The swamp is the unmapped area of the game. First, you must find the boat keys and some fuel (depending on the difficulty you may or may not have to get fuel) before heading to the boat. The mud makes you quite loud and it's very difficult to navigate through. Stray too far and you leave the map boundaries and you automatically die. The monsters are also more likely to be in this area. The mud also makes you slow so it will be difficult to run away from them. The plus side is that the thick mud covers all your tracks so you will be able to hide. But there are no supplies in there so if you run out of batteries you are basically fucked.\n\nb. If you manage to traverse through the swamp you will reach the boathouse with a small boat. Fill up the tank and crank the engine but do so quickly because it will make a lot of noise that will attract the monsters and you’ll be cornered. If you manage to turn it on you escape and win the game.\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nGameplay will consist of multiple difficulty levels that all change aspects f the game to make each level different and more challenging.\n\n**1.** **Easy-**\n\n**a.** The player is given a fully charged flashlight with spare batteries. A fully charged walkie talkie with spare batteries. A map with important landmarks circled. A fully loaded pistol with 3 extra bullets can be found throughout the map. They are also given a backpack with some supplies and tools. There will also be a filled gas tank in the mechanics. They are also given a gas mask.\n\n**b.** You have three chances for your teammate to revive you after being attacked.\n\n**c.** You will be notified when you near the edge of the map.\n\n**2.** **Medium-**\n\n**a.** The player is given a fully charged flashlight and walkie-talkie but no extra batteries. A map with no markers on it. An empty pistol, bullets can be found throughout the map. They are also given an empty backpack, supplies and tools are found through the map. There will be a gas tank in the mechanics but it's empty. The gas mask can be found somewhere in the town.\n\n**b.** You have one chance for your teammate to revive you after being attacked.\n\n**c.** You are warned when you have entered the edge of the map.\n\n**3.** **Hard-**\n\n**a.** The player is given a dead flashlight and walkie-talkie. Batteries can be found throughout the map. A damaged map, so parts of it will be missing. A pistol with 3 shots in it, no extra bullets can be found. They are given a damaged backpack so half as many things can be stored in it. You must find the gas tank, but it is full if found. The gas mask is found inside the mine.\n\n**b.** If you are attacked then you will die, no revives.\n\n**c.** If you enter the edge the monsters will scream more which is your queue telling you to GTFO.\n\n**4.** **Extreme-**\n\n**a.** The player starts off with no flashlight nor walkie-talkie, those and batteries must be found throughout the map. There are not given a map nor a pistol. They are not given a backpack so the player must carry each item individually. You must find the gas tank and also fuel for it. There is no gas mask.\n\n**b.** If one teammate dies the game is over.\n\n**c.** There is no warning for the edge. You must learn the map and area to make sure you don't walk into it. If you do though, after a short time you'll automatically be killed.\n\n**5.** **Custom-**\n\n**a.** In this difficulty the players can adjust everything in the game. They can adjust how many batteries, the lifespan of the flashlight and walkie-talkie, the level of detail on the map, how many bullets, etc.\n\n**b.** To unlock this game mode you must, in any difficulty, travel to the end of the mines and find the source of the fungus. You must also succeed in all 3 escape paths. This will give you an achievement and unlock this game mode.\n\n**ITEMS**\n\n**1.** **Backpack-**\n\n**a.** Used to store things. Pretty self-explanatory.\n\n**2.** **Flashlight-**\n\n**a.** Used to light the way since it's in the middle of the night.\n\n**3.** **Walkie Talkie-**\n\n**a.** Used to communicate with your team-mate since you can split up to find things faster but also help each other, with manuals and stuff. It makes noise so use wisely.\n\n**4.** **Map-**\n\n**a.** The map is used to help navigate the area. Depending on your difficulty will determine the quality of the map.\n\n**5.** **Pistol-**\n\n**a.** Since you are a cop you are given a pistol. You can shoot the monsters to scare them off, but it makes you a bigger target since if they start following you again they will pair up.\n\n**6.** **Gas Mask-**\n\n**a.** The gas mask is used to enter the mines. Its to help stop coughing, which attracts the monsters, when inside the mine due to the fumes in the air.\n\n**7.** **Fuel Tank-**\n\n**a.** A gas tank can be found throughout the map and is used to fill up the car or the boat.\n\n**MONSTER**\n\nI was inspired by the Wendigos from Until Dawn. Something similar to that, or maybe even Wendigos in general would be cool. I also want them to be the actual villagers.\n\nThe story behind them is that while they were mining they dug deep and found a cave with some fungus in it. The fungus releases toxins in the air which they breathed in and over time turned into monsters. The young girl was playing by the mine when one killed her, and so her parents called the police but on their way the other monsters attacked and turned everyone into one of them. That is why the village is abandoned and all ransacked. Clues of survivors could be found throughout it, like skeletons, or supplies left behind.\n\nThe monsters are blind and can’t smell, but their hearing is extremely good which is why you must be quiet and stay still when they are around you. They use echolocation, just like the Until Dawn ones.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do you guys think????"
k6ww4y,Fantasy setting survival horror that plays like S.T.A.L.K.E.R,"Had this cool idea that's more of a setting idea than a game, but I want to share it. I love the STALKER games, especially the Anomaly mod as they force you to really prepare for an inhospitable zone that's full of monsters, bandits, mercenaries, but most importantly: valuable artifacts and loot.\n\nSo imagine this gameplay loop within a generic fantasy setting such as elder scrolls or Forgotten realms, instead of the Meltdown zone, it takes place in the ruins of an ancient civilization that was much more magically advanced, harnessing the energy magic provides in a similar way we use electricity to the point that they have advanced infrastructure and weapons capable of slaying gods.\n\nI originally envisioned this to be a first person game to be as similar to stalker as possible, but I could also see it being a CRPG, or even a tactics based game like Mordheim. \n\nThe main idea is there would be an ancient, yet advanced ruin that many different people, factions, and monsters wish to exploit, and plenty of valuables and unknown powers to steal.\n\nI know nothing about game designing so I can't say how hard this would be to make."
k6uy9x,Funny idea: Battle with medieval-like spaceships.,"It would not realy make much sense but it could realy be fun. It could partialy be battle game, partialy building game. Perhaps you could build your castles onto asteroids.\n\nCastles on asteroids would act as your biggest ships. Instead of canons they would be equiped with balistas, catapults, trebuchets etc.\n\nMiddle ships would look like normal sailing ships and would contain above mentioned weapons as well\n\nSmaller ships would look like small ships or vagons and carriages\n\nInstead of soliders there would be bowmen, axemen, spearmen and knights. Knights would ride horse-resembling space motorcycles while other soldier would be equiped with scafanders resembling medieval underwear overalls and would have some aditional clothing on top of it. They would be all equiped with jets and oxygen tanks. Perhaps you could make it little bit starwars parody, making knights using lightsabers, spearmen lightspear, axemen lightaxe and bowmen lightarrows.\n\nSo obviously this would be 3d game since having it 2d would not make much sense or difference from ground based medieval strategy... The third dimension could be represented by shades between red and blue and therefor the game could still remain 2d top down in the end."
k6uqvk,Game UI is really considered by gamers?,Do gamers take game UI into consideration? Do they prefer creative main menus or classic main menus. I Just wanted to come up with a unique main menu idea. Opinions please. Thank You.
k6rmum,A tycoon city-building/strategy game where the tech tree is competitive,"I've played a lot of strategy and city-building games and a lot of them have tech trees. However, most of the time I find that once I have identified a reasonably sure path in the tech trees, I pretty much stick to it without much deviation in my future playthroughs. This makes the game feel less challenging over time and reduces its replay value which is why I came up with this idea.\n\nThe idea is a tycoon city-building strategy game where you mold your city's growth and economy through technology in a high stakes tech race to survive in a barren sunless world.\n\nIn the game there are other competitors (probably AI) whom you have to compete and trade with to sustain and advance your economy. \n\nYou would only be able to produce certain goods after you did the necessary research. For example you can only produce gas after you do the research to produce it from coal. You can patent, publicize or keep technologies you have researched secret to try and maintain an economic or technological monopoly. However, all players (including the AI) can also do the same research. After one of the players unlocks the research, they have the option to patent it.\n\nWhen a technology is patented, only the player or AI that patented it can use that technology for production. In addition, the trading cost of that product goes up in the world market. However, the technology would be unlocked for everyone else for free so the other players' tech trees wouldn't be blocked off.\n\nWhen a technology is publicized, the technology becomes available to all players for free, but the trading cost of that product goes down in the world market. You can use this mechanic to lower world prices for a product you don't want to produce but would like to import.\n\nWhen a technology is researched but kept secret, the player who has researched it gains a technological and production monopoly of the product so other players still have to spend resources researching it, but they run the risk of losing the patent to someone else.\n\nAs for the setting, I thought of a barren sunless world to justify the need for the player to keep trading for certain resources (e.g. food and wood) well into the late stages of the game.\n\nLet me know what you think and ways I can improve on this idea"
k6re2d,Has this idea ever been done? A protagonist that can change colour.,"I feel like there must have been a game like this at some point, because the idea seems so obvious, but I can't think of one.   \n\nThe idea is, the player can control changing the main character's colour at will, and use this ability to blend in with its surroundings (or confer other benefits).  The colour changing control is analog, like a mouse-wheel or gamepad stick.  \n\nSo for example, if the character is moving through a forest, it can change to a dark green and be invisible to predators.  The character is both a prey and predator animal, so it needs to both stay hidden from predators, and ambush prey to stay alive.   \n\nPotentially this could have a metroid-vania like angle, as the character acquires new colours, it can travel further into more dangerous terrain (e.g. it can turn white to blend in with snow etc).\n\nI started making a crude prototype of this years ago and then forgot all about it.  Curious if anyone knows of a game like it or has any interest in the general idea."
k6pam7,Marvel Fighting Game,"A Marvel fighting game (avengers, x-men, etc) that uses the same engine/plays the same way as Bandai Nanco's Naruto Ultimate Ninja Storm series.   \nBig character roster.  \nLots of skins.  \nLots of special moves.  \nTeam special moves.  \nCasual fighting game (simple controls, the same for most characters).  \nExtras and fanservice."
k6nsjq,"Have maps, need gameplay ideas","I have many maps from WWII battlegrounds, to a recreated Death Star map, to a jail.

k6mw5v,This is less of a game and more for someone really tech savvy,"Idk if this is the best sub to put it so tell me if there’s a better one\n\nBasically a program where you make your own video game (preferably a pretty simple game engine) and then can transfer it over to a little cheap-ish console that doesn’t have the capability of getting games from anywhere else besides the game transfer. You can also post your games on the internet for others to download and play (this is inspired by BrainPad and Makecode Arcade)\n\nAnd the second idea is much more original: a Game and Watch game maker. You get a little console with a monochrome screen (to give game and watch vibes as well as keeping costs low, and it’s basically the same thing as last time with a higher res display. Maybe you could also have custom cases that house the electronics so you can choose the amount of buttons and customize the case"

k6je5b,Air-floating city-wreck survival game,"So you were living in a city floating in an atmosphere of inhospitable planet, perhaps gas giant. The city used antigravitational technology to float. Something happened and whole city was ripped apart into small pieces floating in atmosphere. You need to survive and colect resources yet you have to be carefull not to fall from those pieces into open atmosphere.\n\nFortunately enough, you have some sort of flying suit which you can use to transport around. The suit can be upgraded but it also is energeticaly dependant and when you get away with all energy, you cant use it. The jumping is less expensive than flying. You can survive for a while without a suit but for long. The suit could also have many other abilities to develop. You could also develop your own floating base, upgrade your home, perhaps first build a dome around it get some oxygen generator etc.\n\nYour main goal is to survive and also reach special kind of antena in asteroid belt to call for help. For this you have to upgrade your suit enough to be able to fly to asteroid belt or perhaps build a vehicle. You dont live in the city alone, there are other survivors. It is upto you how would you cooperate with them. Some are more hostile, some more friendly.\n\nThere could be some strange flying creatures native to the planet which you could fight and tame and you could build helper robots."
k5zzk7,It's not a game Idea yet,"Hè Everyone,\n\nSo as I finished (oke almost 😉) my previous project (and the holiday coming up) its time for a new project. I have been browsing this Reddit for a while now and started to form an idea but the idea is still a bit thin and feels as if it is missing something. So feedback or ideas would be greatly appriciated)\n\nHere is what I got do far, you are a regular Guy that somehow ended up in a modern (moving) train (think snowpiercer without the people). In order to get off the train it needs to stop (as jumping out will definitly kill you). There is only one problem you are stuck in the back of the train and controls are in the front. Now walking towards the front of the train shouldn't be that hard, atleast if it wasn't for a conscious ai trying to prevent the train from stopping.\n\nThe genre would be an adventure / puzzle game (think Tomb Raider meets Portal meets Stanley Parabel). I am thinking of adding a (robotic) dog or something like that to keep the player company / help on the puzzles.\n\nAs for a core game mechanic there isn't one het, maybe you need to avoid the ai at staying out of sight of the camera's, maybe the companion is able to disable security systems or something like that. \n\nAlso maybe this is just me overthinking but why is the train able to move through the world (other people outside should notice it right?) Where is the train going or is it going in circles? What happens when you reach the end?\n\nBasically the idea is there but it is creating more questions instead of giving me some guidence. \n\nWould love to hear your toughts, ideas and feedback.\n\nKind regards\n\nProtoThis"
k5zuxi,Counterstrike (or other FPS) mod using Dawn of War models,"I realize this in itself isn't an original game idea, but it's something of a compromise to a larger game concept, based in the Warhammer 40k World. The game would be an MMORPG, where you can level  up from basic Space Marine to commander, and choose different specializations or use different vehicles. Anyway as a much watered down version I was wondering if it would be possible to mae a mod of Counterstrike (any version) using the models from the dawn of war games? Even if it's limited to say Space Marines vs Orks with only a few different types of models and weapons, I still think this would be really cool. especially if you can also incorporate the DOW maps. Just to be clear though, there would be a lot of legal repercussions if trying to monetize this game in any way."

k5u0fo,The AntiMage,"So I've been mostly without sleep for the passed 3 or so days. I used to have all these great and fantastical ideas that could have been extremely good games as a kid, but as I've gotten older, my creativity has kind of gone away. Today, though, on almost 36 hours of little to no sleep, it's back in full force. I want this game in my head to be reality, but I haven't the know-how to make it happen. Let me lay it on you. Do keep in mind, the entire idea is still in infancy, and I'm only just fleshing out the BEGINNING of the script. My expertise is in writing, so this may just turn into a book, but I want it to be very decision driven.   \n\n\nBASIC PREMISE: You are an antimage, an elite military unit designated to fight witches and warlocks in humanity's war against mages. The entire game is revolved around 2 things - an excellent story, which I am currently hammering down, and combat fluidity. I envision it would take HEAVY combat influence from Dark Souls and The Witcher 3. During fights, you will need to think about the environment - not only how it will affect you, but how you will affect it. Collateral damage to farmland, structures, roads, etc. will lower your already lowly reputation, as the common folk mostly see you as part of the mage problem. From time to time, you may encounter non magical humans who may want to assault/kill you. It is up to you to find non-lethal ways to dispatch them, or to slaughter them senselessly and face the associated consequences. \n\nPLOT: You're being sent South to your nation's capital to track down and kill Sage, the leader of the mage resistance. Along the way, you will meet Godfrey, your handler, and Rosric, a representative of the merchant's guild. (As well as a myriad of other characters I haven't fleshed out yet) Along the way, you'll find that this war has blurred battle lines, as it seems that mages, witches, and warlocks have penetrated deep into the nation's lands. Sage himself is in the city planning something BIG. It is your job it either stop it... or perhaps to join him. \n\nENEMIES: As an Anti-Mage, your job is to kill witches and warlocks. These are extremely high power mages that have taken in so much mana they are barely human anymore. Normal mages are not your duty to kill, but you may find that collecting bounties on them may fetch some coin. Unlike a normal mage, witches and warlocks will all have unique abilities, all of which must be accounted for before engaging them. These powerful enemies may increase the chance of a battle having collateral damage, which is something to look out for. An example is I've already heavily fleshed out a witch who uses her own blood as a weapon. Mid way through the fight, she will sprout wings made of blood and become capable of a wind attack that can blow structures over. There will also be a myriad of magical creatures to hunt, as the empire doesn't like magic existing right under its nose. These will range from Dragons to cats with illusionary capabilities.\n\nWEAPON SYSTEM: You are an anti-mage, which means you are bound to a magical relic that you use to fight. In this case, it's a pair of gauntlets that can fire spearheaded chains made of shadows moderate distances. They also make excellent melee weapons. As you play, you will unlock new techniques. Just as well, defeating Witches and Warlocks will award you with a rune which you can take to an arcanist to forge into a runeplate you can put into one of your gauntlet's 2 rune slots. These runes will fundamentally modify how the weapons work or the capabilities of the weapons. Example: I've fleshed out an earthen rune which will allow the player to use the shadow chains to pull up sections of the earth to use as shields, or to throw enemies off their feet. \n\nCOMBAT: The entire game is built around the combat system. As stated before, I envision the combat to be similar to Dark Souls/The Witcher. What will set the combat here apart is acrobatic capability and of course, high-impact environmental destruction. When against a Witch or Warlock, a player should feel as though they are evenly matched with them, and that a decisive strike from either party would kill the other. I haven't quite thought about what happens if you die. Probably load back to whatever autosave you were previously at. \n\nSo, I think I got everything I want to post here for now. I'll conclude with some problems with the idea:\n\n\&gt; I do not know how to code/animate/really anything related to game design. I'd be down to write/creatively direct this project, but it's kind of dead if I couldn't get the resources to make it happen.\n\n\&gt; The combat system in my head is incredibly complex, and I'm not sure players would take to it all that well. It would be up to a dev team to simplify the controls as much as possible without losing gameplay. \n\n\&gt; Environmental destruction is important to the idea, however some may find it frustrating, and the technology available may not like it. \n\nThere is is! Any encouragement/criticism of the idea would be greatly appreciated!"

k5orf5,360 localized text chat,"My idea is a text chat system similar to text chats that display the spoken text over the player talking. Text chats like this have one small issue; you have to be looking at the player in order to see what they are saying. I've come up with a theoretical solution to that problem. My idea is to have the text of people speaking nearby show up at the edges of the screen in the direction they are speaking, sort of like a damage indicator does, so that you can know where they are and are able to see what they are saying no matter which direction you're facing. My idea was inspired by how Minecraft handles the narration of sounds. Forgive me if this is the wrong place to post as I realize this is more of an idea for a game mechanic rather than a game itself."

kd9glb,Looking to develop a concept for a roguelike hack-and-slash based around i-frame abuse further,"I've been harboring and polishing a game idea for a good while now, a little over a year. It would be a top-down, fast-paced hack-and-slash, set in a dumpy urban setting. The ideas I've had and tried to polish so far are as follows (exact numeric values are mostly kept vague, as those things would require playtesting and player feedback to fine tune properly):  \n\nLevels will be comprised of randomly arranged, smaller areas, but the stage itself will be completely open, so no doors separating these areas \n\nThe player will always die in one hit  \n\nThe player can only hold one weapon at once\n\nMost enemies will use ranged attacks and will die in at most 3 hits with base damage  \n\nActively aggressive enemies will be rare to encourage the player to constantly push forward\n\nKills are optional but are the only way to get rewards (I will elaborate on this further) \n\nHitting enemies will grant the player i-frames as long as their weapon is making contact with an enemy or a destructible object, and landing hits on enemies properly will deduct from the next swing cooldown, the amount increasing with each successful hit until capping out at a certain threshold \n\nAll projectiles will be deflectable with parries (I will elaborate on this further as well)  \n\nA meter that fills up with kills but drains over time, but will grant the player a long window of invincibility alongside drastically increased damage if full, with successful projectile deflections being able to fill the meter back up to the highest point the meter reached since the previous activation \n\nThe amount of enemies killed in the stage will add up to a percentage, all adding up to 100%. After the boss on the stage has been defeated, the player will be granted a weapon, increasing in power with every 25th percentage up to 75%, 100% granting them a choice of three 75% strength weapons. The clear rate of the previous stage will also dictate the difficulty increase on the following one, increasing things like enemy movement and shot speed \n\nClearing a stage will have a chance of granting the player a special currency, the chance being the percentage of enemies killed on the stage beforehand (which would be displayed on the screen at all times except while in a boss battle), said currency will allow the player to set up temporary checkpoints at any location in a stage that can save the player from dying once or more times, depending on the amount of currency fed into the checkpoint \n\nThese checkpoints will only work within stages and their corresponding boss battles \n\nCompleting tasks ranging from very general to extremely specific will unlock costumes for the player character that only serve a cosmetic purpose  \n\nThe player will collect cash throughout their run which is dropped by enemies, the amount being randomized within thresholds determined by the toughness of the enemy killed, which can then be spent in a shop in the hub area to grant bonuses for the next run \n\nAll cash not spent will be taken away from the player upon starting a new run (a la Rogue Legacy) \n\nThe shop will be upgraded with more options to choose from by getting predetermined landmarks in the total amount of kills racked up between individual runs \n\n\nThese are all the mechanics and ideas I have had in mind, honest and brutal feedback and additional ideas would be very greatly appreciated!"
kd6svh,Is there anyone Who can give me some ideas," I want to make a story-driven action / shooter game (Like Control or Quantum Break), can you give me some ideas for the game?

kd3nj7,Cool Classroom mechanic ideas?,"Hello, I'm currently trying to develop a concept for a story based high school game and I would appreciate a few suggestions for a closed off classroom environment as the grander schools mechanics have been roughly conceptualized.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese can be a range of serious to jokes, and here's an example to gauge.   \n\n\n    Permission to go to x\n    \n    Player may ask their teacher to go to places such as a restroom, and depending on the plausibility of the request may be allowed, declined, or challenged.\n    \n    Challenge mode will consist of 15 seconds of rapid fire questions the player must answer to lower their teacher’s suspicion. Failure to do this will lead to the teacher declining."
kd1xk7,Dynamic AI,"Let's say that the game consist of a small town and in that town are NPCs. In a regular game they are nameless, have a few voice lines and really don't do much apart from either run away or fight you. My idea would be all NPCs would be given names, jobs and essentially have a proper life. The NPCs would have a web of relationships such as family members, friends, etc. They will have their own set property and live in that property like a normal person. Also unlike in games like RDR2 where killing an NPC simply puts a bounty on your head and decreases your rep slightly. Instead of just despawning and being forgotten about, if the body is found there would be a funeral and people who are close to that person would attend. There would be also a chance of the family launching a vendetta, forming mobs, attacking on sight or generally being pretty vicious to you if you come near them. It would add a lot of depth to games instead of just mindlessly shooting NPCs you would have to think about your consequences and the morality of killing someone, something games seem to have a difficulty in achieving. \n\nAnother thing would be that your actions would have an impact on this town. Injure the shopkeeper? The store will remain closed for several in game days or weeks until they return. Kill the bar owner? The bar could close permanently if they have no designated successor or if their heir chooses to sell the bar. In a similar token if you give $10000 for a homeless person you could see them later with a job and a house. In short whatever you do, positive or negative could affect the gameplay and how in this case the town would change.\n\nThough such a concept would be time-consuming and costly as well as increasingly the power needed to run the game slightly, I feel like games would be a lot more deep and the NPCs more than a moving cardboard cutout of a person. Games like The Sims, The Guild and CK2 and 3 all have various elements of this concept but implanting them in open world action games like GTA or Red Dead would make a much more immersive and interesting experience."
kd0335,SAFEZONE VR Official Announcement Trailer || FREE VR Horror Game,"Hey Guys!\n\nI am so excited to finally post my announcement trailer! I worked over 2 weeks making the sound track, recording video, editing and creating art for this awesome video for my game I have been working on for over 2 YEARS! \n\n**Enough talking!

kcycue,Ghost Of Tsushima inspired medieval Georgia 🇬🇪,"I have been dreaming about this for quite awhile, which is a true fact and would be a historical game: about a 15 year old king who gets on the throne of a destroyed country, but despite of being surrounded by all enemies (outside the country and georgian lords too) \nThe country is fully destroyed and the boy rises the country from the ashes, wins amazing battles with outnumbered army, (55,600 georgian vs 300,000 unitied turkish armies!!) and becomes one of the strongest countries in the region. The people gave him a nickname of David the Builder\n\nLike really, Georgia has an amazing history and culture, music and traditions and it would be amazing to see it as an AAA game or anything that will rise its popularity, it is my goal to one day create or found a game based on this! So expect some questions from me, i will need your opinion about it\nAand you can check the video which is about Wine traditions and georgians history ([link](https://youtu.be/ihIJfKMTLp8)\n(If you watch it, please tell me your toughts about the music or medieval part!)\nThank you very much for the attention ^^"

kcojs1,"3D Pokémon like game, needs final touches","I posted on this subreddit a week or so ago looking for ideas for a game that uses the battle and play style system of Pokémon, except isnt monster collecting. \n\nThe idea was presented to have a game where the player collects “spells” and battles against other mages/wizards. Turn based combat just like Pokémon, thank you to those who suggested this to me.\n\nI’ve hit a speed bump. Pokémon was always one of my favorite games because of the personality that each Pokémon had. Being able to encounter them in the wild, battle with them, evolve them etc really made it work.\n\nHow can I achieve this aspect with the aforementioned magic idea? Spells don’t really have a personality and feel a bit.. bland. If you have other ideas completely then please feel free to share those also"

kcj4wt,im making a new game,hi all\n\nim a developer/designer . 2 days age i decided to start working on a new game. if someone is interested to be my partner. he/she should have alot of ideas and imagination. i only do the technical part but i have no ideas at all. however i posted videos and stuff about the game in the following facebook page\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.facebook.com/Indie-Game-Far-Away-105345144786971](https://www.facebook.com/Indie-Game-Far-Away-105345144786971)
kchzwc,An Assassin's Creed game set in the communist revolution.,"I know that a lot of people dislike the Assassin's Creed series, and I get it. There are many things that the games fail to accomplish, and I know that. However, I have an idea for one anyways.\n\nHear me out: an Assassin's Creed game set in the communist revolution. I think that there would be two separate games. Not just two different protagonists, two separate games. These games would have different protagonists. One is a Templar, the other an Assassin. Please know that both of these games would be short, about the same length as Rogue.\n\nLet's start with the Templars. Your Templar character is fighting for communism, meaning they would be the one to win. Your character is similar to Shay Cormac in Assassin's Creed Rogue; they hunt and kill Assassins. \n\nNow the Assassins. When playing this game, you would be fighting the Templars and communism. Your character is hunting the Templars at the same time they are hunting you. The Assassins in Russia are being destroyed, with many of their members being killed. \n\nAnd both of these games are connected. For example, if you play as the Templar you will see the Assassin character in your playthrough. In fact, you would probably kill them. If you play as the Assassin, you will find and kill the Templar. However, the Templars will always win.\n\nThis was about the two different stories that I think this game could have. I will make another post soon about the setting and mechanics for this game."
kcg6bl,Are devs more likely to pick up an idea if a GDD is put together?,"After researching how ideas turn into games, I came across a framework to answer most/all of the questions developers would have in order to make a game, the GDD. It’s helped me organize the idea and I want to know if it is actually what devs are looking for to get the ball rolling? From the controls to the story to enemy variants and functionality to detailed descriptions of the environment, layout, and character. There’s even a section about why this game is worth making and what makes it stand out from the rest. I don’t have the equipment, manpower, experience, or steady-hand to get on Unreal and Blender to execute this, but I have provided all the tools necessary to execute. \n\nIs this enough?"
kcg2kk,A game where you have to constantly breathe,"The title basically sums up the whole idea.

kcb99n,"A sandbox horror game (Co-op, Multiplayer, and Solo) A sandbox game that is only dedicated to horror","Okay. Hear me out, i’ve been trying to find alott of horror game that I can play with my friends. Now I know there’s many horror games out there but, there not exactly all multiplayers. I want someone to take this idea and create a sandbox game that is only dedicate to horror theme type stuff it’s like Gmod but, only dedicated to horror theme. Give all these people in the world with creativity a game to create their own horror map, this isn’t professional and all but I want to list the many ideas I have for a game like this since I don’t know how to explain much but, by giving y’all an idea of what I mean.\n\n\n1. Allow players to create and customize the look of their own monsters, ghost, and demons. Hopefully with customization and creation like this players can create their own scary looking creature with thier own unqiue looks. \n\n2. Players will be able to create their own map with in game tools and object for you to create your own unique map, you’ll be able to submit your own horror map to the public for other players to play and see your creativity!\n\n3. When submitting your own horror map you’ll be able to name it whatever you want, as long as it’s appropriate of course. After submitting your map, it’ll have its own number code in case other players had the same name idea as yours, so instead of typing the name just type the map number code. Players will be able to upvote and downvote your map, the more upvote the more popular you and your map will be. Which will lead up to your horror map being recommended to other players whose looking for a good horror map to play!\n\n4. When getting popular in the game, there will be a leaderboard of most popular players that has the most upvote on their maps. This way players can view your profile to see what other maps you may have created to go and experience your other maps, you’ll also be able to follow their profile if you enjoy the map they’re creating so that way you don’t miss out on their newest horror map. Don’t worry! You’ll also be able to search up other players and maps of course if they aren’t up in the leaderboard.\n\n5. You’ll be able to list different genre to your map. An example will be creating maps for only solo players, creating map for only multiplayer, and creating a map that can be both solo and multiplayer. You can also list genre of what your map is about like ghost, demons, puzzles, or a mixture of all.\n\n6. You’ll be able to create your very own jumpescare, and implement your own ghost sounds into the jumpscare I should also mention you’ll be able to put your own image in case you wanna go all the way into your map, draw or cosplay your own monster into a image for the jumpscare! Of course if it’s inappropriate like a image of any private parts then it’s possible to report a map and get it ban.\n\n7. The problem that a game like this may run into most is probably the fact that if there’s ever a real image of a real gruesome murder or anything illegal related it’s possible we won’t be aware of it due to it already all out being a sandbox horror game so maybe personal image and audio use wouldn’t be a good idea. The game will have to provide a camera system thing like Spiderman to take a pic of your own horror monster in the game to make a jumpscare.\n\n8. There will be many tools in the game to provide you for making your own horror map. That will allow you to of course make a horror story, like having the players to escape the monster, getting them to kill the monster, and having them to survive as long as possible. You know the possibility of a game like this the amount of creativity from many people! \n\n9. Lastly of course you can make as much map as you want but, if there’s a cap. You’ll be able to save your map into a hard drive. Let’s say each players gets 10 slot so you can create 10 maps. If you wanted to create another one you got to delete one... but! You can always save these map to the hard drive and delete it, I would also want to mention that if you submitted a map to the public it’ll be it’s own separate map be listed in your “Public created horror maps.” In your profile so even if you delete it off your slot it’ll still be a map in public unless you decide to manually delete it off your profile in the section of your profile “Public created horror map.” therefore bye bye forever. I could’ve word that better but, i’m pretty slow in the head.\n\n\nThat’s about it for my brain, I’m honestly sorry for the people who have stuff against people with bad grammar like myself not exactly the best with my paragraph, senetence, comma and periods. I also honestly have no knowledge of how games are made so if this isn’t even possible now i’m looking even dumber but, at the end of the day it was just an ideaa thank you for your time!!"

kc8cbo,a (new?) game mechanic to balance power in MMOs,"MMO games have this problem where players gain power with time and then new players don't have a chance against them hence there is no incentive for new players to join. This should be balanced out in various ways, for e.g. introducing some form of lifetime for players so they cannot get too powerful. I have a new idea of how to balance this based on real cosmology! it goes like this: the world in which the  player exists constantly expands (e.g. new tiles are added to the map) and the players have a maximum speed they can travel (the speed of light!) then when two cities are too far away there would be no way to player to transition from one to the next. Old and powerful players will get to rule and fight each other in their patches of ""visible universes"" while new players can spawn randomly at any patch, either encountering a young or old patch. If the patch is too hard the player can just re-spawn somwhere else until a nice patch is found. This is very rough idea right now. What do you think, can it be used in a real game??"
kc86s8,An Inovation to NPC Interaction in Open World Games,"This may not work at all. I know absolutely nothing. Let me know why it's a crap idea. I dont mind.lol.\n\nMy idea is to attempt to make it feel like you can start a relationship, be it friendship or sexual, with almost any NPC around the map.\n\nMany NPCs will still be normal average NPCs and want nothing to do with you. If you try to talk to them, they can either be rude or lie and say they are busy or something. Just have their interactions be kinda how they are in Rdr2.  \n\nBut, mixed in with them, record like 20 male, and 20 female characters and mix and match them with different NPC models. Meaning each voice would be used for multiple different NPCs. \n\nThese NPCs with extensive dialogue will load around the world alongside the regular NPCs. They could hang around certain bars, parks, or work at businesses. Maybe there could be a way to identify on the map or menu, Idk. If you talk to one, they will have more dialogue options than normal NPCs. \n\nOnce an NPC is activated by talking to them and choosing to hang out or something, that voice is no longer loaded with any other possible relationships  around the world, until that NPC dies or the relationship ends. \n\nRelationships can grow or fade if neglected or if you do things against the NPCs interests. Bad relationships can ruin your reputation at places, causing NPCs to react negatively to you. \n\nMaybe, when a relationship ends in a bad way, if you run into the NPC, they might be hostile in some way. Maybe they will jump you with some NPCs they're with. \n\nBut if you have good relationships with them, if you get into trouble and happen to be around their job or something, they may help you out by helping fight or hiding you in a back room or trunk or something. \n\nBut yeah, basically just kinda imagine it being like Sims, where you can invite all your friends over to your house. Maybe you could all go drinking together at the bar or maybe play golf, watch tv, etc. But it's not a guarantee the NPCs will like each other. Some personalities will mesh better than others. Maybe they could invite you places, but not annoyingly like GTA4. Criminal friends could call for help on a hold up or something. \n\nYou would get perks if your relationship is strong enough. Like, they could work at a car place and give a discount on cars, or a clothes store, hospital, restaurant, bar, etc. \n\nThat's all I got for now. I'm no developer, so I'm sure there are a million reasons why this wouldnt work. Let me know. I just feel that meaningful NPC interaction is the last real wall with open worlds."

kc1kz8,An Idea for a Team Based Class Shooter,"I had an idea for a class shooter with a dungeons and dragons meets steam punk setting. This was mostly born out of the idea of dnd classes being used in a video game that wasn't some sort of virtual dnd emulator, such as Baldur's Gate, and the genre I thought would be the most interesting was a class shooter, which came from my love for tf2. \n\nIf you'd like to make it a team vs team shooter, you could make the context of the fights two rival adventuring parties fighting over who gets to complete a quest. An alternate idea could be a multiplayer class game where in which the party completes quests in the form of game modes, for example, MvM in tf2. These are of course just suggestions, I'm not a game designer, so I'll leave the deeper concepts to the guys who know what they're doing. \n\nThis is my first submission on this subreddit so I'd be happy to see what you guys think!"

kbuyyx,A game where the villain gets tired of waiting for the hero to arrive to fulfill his role and goes on an adventure to find him.,"The characters (npc) were aware that they are in a video game and that they must fulfill their roles, they did not mind dying because they would reappear later. The villain could always see the position of the player from his castle to have the whole environment ready and organized for when he arrives (something like he loves drama) but on one of those occasions after finishing the game and restarting the world the main character no longer appears on his monitor.\nThe rumor that the main character has died without reviving spreads throughout that world causing no one to respect the roles and start wars for control for fear of dying at some point, and the villain tries to find him through the levels, having to beat the bosses who were in charge of him but now have become stronger to take control since they no longer need to be at a standard level according to their roles"

kbnrur,"Git Gud: A roguelite about choices, a poor understanding of git, and how to achieve them all.","(I'm fully aware that Git Gud is already a trademark. Also, I know that git is probably getting misrepresented here.)\n\nUnlike a certain game that literally sings about the world having infinite choices, Git Gud is about having limited choices but not being constrained by it, all while learning how to use git and be a productive ... gitter.\n\nThe game starts off as a roguelike. You will encounter many choices, and eventually die. A mysterious straight line with many nodes appear, each representing a choice you made.\n\nMany things done in this game are explicit ""choose one"" things. When you level up, you get only one stat point. When you find a grindstone, you can upgrade only one weapon. When you find a shop, you can purchase only one item regardless of your money.\n\nAt this point, you are not yet aware that those were choices.\n\nYou are presented with a second run.\n\nYou died again, and you see another line.\n\nEach game has not much different, but you realize that the more different choices you have made in previous runs, the more liberating options become available.\n\nFor example, the game has multiple key stats for your character (STR, INT, AGI, END), but in the early runs, only STR and INT are presented. If you already chose STR in one and INT in another, AGI becomes possible among the choices.\n\nWeapon classes and other decisions like dungeon maps also become more available as you explore your gameplay decisions and expand your tree.\n\nBut no matter what, the boss of the dungeon remains undefeated.\n\nUntil one day (after you realize what you have been doing, i.e. the game expanded like 5 or 6 choices already), a wizard appears. In the world of Git Gud, a wizard (as opposed to a mage) is a highly respected user of the arcane who infuses mana into himself and can use it at will. Wizards are among the highest of the social system, and many wizards were once knights, mages, archers, and all the basic classes (i.e. it's the apex class of the game). The title is never bestowed upon someone or taken by oneself, but is *realized*.\n\nThe Wizard says, throughout the cycle of life and death, the Samsara, the seed of realization will begin to grow in youe mind. It is neither granted by the Wizard nor any god, but it was conceived by your own desire to try multiple strategies to succeed, even if that will cost countless lives.\n\nHe visualizes all the old choices you have made, the choices you have expanded in many aspects together. You see those lines being merged into a complex branching tree.\n\n""From now on, just start where you want.""\n\nThe first power has been granted to you: the backup. If you die, you can now reload the game at any point you wish, at any point in gameplay history at all.\n\nYou will begin with full health at that point, and all equipment, but no money.\n\nSometimes it helps, though.\n\nYou manage to branch out a bit more, and create more decisions. Small, incremental features.\n\nThe Wizard unlocks your second power, the tag. You can now tag good points in your tree.\n\nThe third power is one of the greatest. The merge.\n\nIf you made a branch at point A, and you arrive at point B where there are multiple paths between A and B, you can call upon your predecessors and take both or all the decisions.\n\nIf you merge in a market map that you have been before (and branch from the same point), you can buy more items, but only if you can cover your old spirits. (You cannot directly sell an item, but you can use ""trade in"" or ""use and buy"" options to either sell or consume the old item before buying a new one.)\n\nIf you merge in a puzzle map, you can have your predecessor push one button and you push another. He must have used that button before though.\n\nAnd finally, if you merge in a boss room, this is where things get fun."
kbmdim,Fantasy Fps game where you play as an mercenary group that takes quest and helps people.,"I’d imagine it to be a sort of adventure where there is a huge map with various villages and kingdoms you can explore. For the main story I would want to do something different. Instead of their being some big bad kingdom you have to take down im thinking something sort of episodic. What i mean for this is for the story missions you spend 5 to 8 missions dealing with a specific event and you go on to the next. In whatever area the story missions are at there would be side missions you can do.The Mercenary group im thinking about is a group that basically just recently formed so as the story goes on you can see them sort of bond more as the story goes on. Alot of Fantasy games have a sort of serious tone so I would want this game to be a mix of comedy and a sort of dark tone.\n\n\nI imagine the gameplay mechanics to be sort of like a movement shooter(think something like doom). There would be multiple characters you can play as, each with their own different play styles. For the characters it would be the basic dungeon group plus some extras: Knight,Wizard,Archer,Barbarian,Pirate,Necromancer, and Ninja. There is also the blacksmith who is part of the group though he is non playable. Like alot of fantasy games there would be a level system where each time you level up you can increase health and improve your skills/abilities. For armor and weapons you will need to find the right items to bring to the Blacksmith so he can forge them. You will of course need to get stronger armor and weapons as your adventure continues to deal with stronger enemies. You would be able to completely customize/enchant your weapons to deal stuff like fire damage, ice damage,make it summon lightning etc. Similar to terraria you would be able to hide your armor and have clothes over it so you can look the way you want(though this would probably be useless since your in first person unless you got friends). Speaking of friends you can either have personal friends join you in your journey or find random people online to help.\n\n\nFeel free to tell me your thoughts about this in the comments."
kbfyp1,Deckbuilding Roguelike except your deck is a shotgun and the cards are extra barrels,"Came up with it while thinking about how Mothergunship would have been more fun if there was a more static base gun to build around but more variance in weapon parts, which immediately brought my mind to deckbuilding roguelikes like Slay the Spire.  I had the idea of a roguelike where you started off with a basic double-barreled shotgun, but through exploring would find more barrels to attach to the shotgun that could do different things, like have elemental properties or shoot slugs instead of pellets.  There could be incentive to position the barrels in ways (barrel synergies?), as well as reasons to either go for high-barrel or low-barrel runs (more barrels=longer reload?).  It's mostly just a random idea I've had the past week or so, I think it'd be a pretty fun way to create an FPS roguelike that still had a deckbuilding-ish strategy to it"

I know the idea sounds like its not fit for a horror game but I feel like it looks good so far. I need game mechanics though since right now its looking too similar to dark deception."
kberx8,"""Laser"" skirmish for mobile phone.","So I was scrolling though tiktok and I saw this video of a guy using an old COD handgun sticker and was going through his house using his camera pretending to shoot people with it. ( maybe you've seen it ) \nAnd it gave me the idea of a PVP game where shooting activates your mobile flashlight and if aimed at another person versing you their camera would pick that up and would take damage,\n so kind of like laser skirmish in real life but a mobile app and as you progress you unlock better guns with longer distances.  And character running speed varies to how quickly you can run irl.\n\nJust a thought but I'd find that fun."
kbcg7s,Pokemon Go style Bounty Hunter Game.,"Imagine a Pokemon Go style game where instead of Pokemon there are virtual criminals wandering around in public spaces. The player will need to physically get to the location of the virtual criminals, engage in some sort of in app capture process, and turn the criminal into a local Bounty Redemption Hub. It would be possible to gang up with other bounty hunters with the same app to take down really dangerous criminals or to help level up a friend. This idea could be combined with the Star Wars / Mandilorian universe if Disney wants more money or could be a generic scifi or western universe.\n\nObviously I don't have the resources to make this, but I felt it would be fun for the community here to think about it."
kbbv4a,FOREBODE - A Horror Visual Novel and Life Simulator,"**STORY SYNOPSIS**  \nThe player acts as a recently graduated interior designer named Romy Shelly who uses her entire savings to purchase and temporarily live in flat 110, a cheap property inside an old building. Shelly plans on working full time to purchase materials, renovate the property herself, take before and after photos to expand on her professional portfolio then sell the newly renovated flat and hopefully make money back from her investment. However shortly after Shelly's purchase property values in the area begin to plummet after the guy in flat 101 dies a violent death. A few weeks later the couple in 102 meet a similar fate... then the old lady in 103.. the family in 104.... 105.... 106... Will Romy sell the property at a loss then leave for good, will she unravel the mysteries of the cursed apartment complex or be next in line?\n\nPart life simulator and part narrative rich horror visual novel players must use their time wisely to investigate then put a stop to the curse before it's too late. \n\n**FEATURES**\n\n* Rich narrative experience driven by the player\n* Relationship management\n* Job management\n* Money management system\n* Customize Romy's temporary home\n* Stress meter\n* Fun and leisurely stress reducing mini-games!\n* Multiple endings\n\n**SO THIS WAS THE IDEA...**\n\nThe idea is to allow players time to find a comfortable method of managing Romy's life, finances, relationships and leisure activities. If the player wants to stop the curse they must deviate from their comfortable method of balance. They may choose to sacrifice their personal relationships, finances and their leisure time while attempting to keep stress levels down. An inexpensive method of keeping stress levels down would be to buy then drink alcohol at the risk of Romy craving alcohol possibly leading to alcoholism and undesirable story consequences. The player may choose to take out one or more credit cards which may temporarily resolve their financial problems but gets Romy in more debt. Romy may only have time to see her personal friends while ignoring her work colleagues offers of friendship making work more stressful or vice versa.\n\nThe whole thing could easily be made in Ren'Py with a good writer, artist, programmer and probably a whole lot more thought.\n\nThanks for reading."

kbb8rd,Any Platformer requests or ideas,Long story short Im trying to design and make a quick platformer but I'm stuck in so many directions. I tried to go mechanic based but I made way to many from a rocket hammer to A Gravity dash. Does anyone have any requests for a platformer or maybe a simple mechanic to design around?
kbb89v,The Mountain King,"Context: In the Hall of the Mountain King was a piece made by Edvard Grieg in 1875. It was a song I liked ever since I first heard it and I came across a Heavy Metal remix made by FalKKonE. They make a lot of Heavy Metal remix's and I recommend you check them out but anyways. Here is the game idea:\n\nGame type; It is like Enter the Gungeon and Hades. You can choose some spesific upgrades before a run. There are resources you can keep and can't keep upon resetting. You can buy upgrades during the run and upgrade yourself to an extent with the materials you keep. The game can essentially take forever to win. And the reason for that is, you must fulfill requierments to progress. Let's call them primary objectives. When you finish all of them, you unlock the final boss.\n\nFirst, you create your character; Male or female is the first choice. Then you can change their body to your liking for a tiny bit. This way, the horny bastards won't be too dissapointed and nobody can blame the game for sexualising anyone.\n\nTutorials; Unlike most games, you dont start with ""weapons"". You are working in your families farm but even there is not safe because earth itself has become and enemy of man. You learn how to block, hit, move, dodge etc.\n\nAs your progress further and further, you unlock some new abilities and are placed in a training room so you can learn what the ability can do. But you also get rewarded for completing them. The faster, the more loot. You have the option to skip and just get a brief explanation on what it does but can return to the room at any time to practice with the ability.\n\nThe prologue; ""With the first breath of life on earth, 4 holy beings were created. The king of Fire, Mountains, Wind and Lake. They shaped the earth together and protected it from the darkness that lurked close. Until thousands of years ago, when something slipped under their all seeing eyes. An evil entity of unknown origin and pure evil. This entity made its way into the mind of the Mountain King, slowly corrupting his mind with dark thoughts. That was until, he snapped. He was finally taken over by the entity, his every move controlled like a puppet. At that dark day, a prophecy came from the remaining 3 un-corrupted kings that one day, the child of the 4 forces of earth shall be born and defeat the dark entity residing in the Mountain Kings mind.""\n\n\*Group of children, including the main character\*:""Wow........""\n\nThe Innkeeper: ""That's just a fairy tale old man. Do you really think some weird shadow monster could take over something that is basically a god? The land has always been this way.""\n\nElderly Story-teller:""I won't tell you what to belive. But if something really did create us, why would they turn our races lives into torment?""\n\nThe Innkeeper: ""If you want a room in my inn you better stop filling these kids heads with lies and prophecies. We don't need any false hope here""\n\nElderly Story-teller: \*Annoyed grunt\*\n\n\*Exists flashback\*\n\n\*Chosen name\*: I always wanted to belive that. That one day, we wouldn't have to fear for our lives every second. That we could go out in the night without risking a grusome death. But it has been 15 years and with each day, what little hope I have left from hearing that story keeps getting smaller and smaller. But the Innkeeper was right I guess. It was just a fairy tale.\n\nPenny Firehearth (Mom): ""WAKE UP SLEEPY HEAD, ITS TIME FOR HARVEST!""\n\n\*Chosen name\*: But this is better than nothing I guess.\n\nSo, my head and hands hurt so I will be writing this in multiple parts. This is all I could write for now. C&amp;C is welcome."
kbamgx,Rhythm game where you don’t obey the rhythm,"This is a game where all the enemies go to the beat of the song, but you aren’t required to.\n\nThis incentivizes the player to dodge on the beat, and attack on the offbeat. Should player attack animations be measured in beats?\n\nThe goal is to create situations where it’s “your turn” or “the enemies turn” without descending into turn based combat.\n\nMany games already do things like this, like mantis lords from hollow knight, or hyper light drifter, or crypt of the necrodancer. How can I make this different from those?"
kb8r5d,A regular game that slowly transitions from one language to another,"A normal game that's fun to play with a lot of dialogue,  like Bioshock, my time at Portia, etc.  but as you play the game replaces more and more of your native language with your target language."

kb6ept,Help me make a 3d platformer mechanic!,"Do any of you have some cool mechanics for 3d collect a thon platformers that are as versatile as cappy from mario odyssey(has to be completely original) somthing that can be chained with the movement. Something that allows players to move around skillfully using a mechanic. Needs to be simple. Look at this video if u want to know what im talking about: https://youtu.be/z_KVEjhT4wQ. I already have an idea in mind, something similar to the copy ability from Kirby, but I dont know how it would be executed. Example: in odyssey, the capture mechanic is the ""core"" mechanic, and cappy is the way it is executed. That is what I am requesting. A cool way to execute a mechanic."
kb4s2d,Random game idea I had that’ll probably never actually happen.,"\nA game where you download a mobile app where you can create your own spaceship. \n\nDifferent locations in real life represent different planets, you can take your phone to these locations and then visit the planets in game, maybe even with some AR stuff.\n\nYou can also make your own planets by buying the desktop version, then your computer will be the location for your planet.\n\nYou can also interact with other spaceships if you meet someone else with the app. You could trade with them or have space battles and stuff like that.\n\nThis idea might not be plausible, mainly because I have no background in programming and I don’t really plan on pursuing it much. I just wanted to get this off my chest."
kb4il8,The potential of “Welcome to Winkletown”,"Welcome to Winkletown is a causal detective browser game made by Chaz, Ckpenguin and Shock-Dingo. The gameplay is quite unique to other games and it can potentially be the next popular game like “Among Us”. Among Us was developed many months before it became popular on every devices. Here are the fixes that are good to be implemented in Welcome to Winkletown.\n\nFixes:\nDifferent levels: beginner= can get two accusations wrong before failing. Intermediate=can get one wrong. Advanced= the current version. Hard= there will be a timer.\n\nMultiplayer mode: \nThere can be three multiplayer mode to be exact.\n1) two people compete to get the most point when timer ends(w/o failing due to false accusation but a penalty that reduce point)\n2)two people compete and receive points.game ends when one gets two /three wrong. The winner decided by the end points \n3) two people compete, clues used by one is shared. A winner is the one who reached a certain point.\n\nMechanism:\nOption to cross out not suspected winkle.\n\nI am real sorry if you think this is not related to game idea but I don’t know where to post otherwise. I hope the devs of the game see the potential and implement them. I would love to see the game in steam and mobile like “Among Us”. Thanks"
kb2f5k,[Mechanic] Like night and day,"I'm sure this would be one hell of a mechanic to program, but one I'd like to see in a game, if it doesn't already exist, is the game world reflect the real world as far as the time of the day.  Using the internal clock in the player's computer, console, or mobile device, it could make the game's environment match the player's environment.\n\n\nIf the player happens to be playing the game at 8:00 AM, then the lighting and shadows should reflect the sun's approximate position at 8 AM.  Perhaps take it a step further and program the game to recognize the month and date and adjust the seasons accordingly.\n\n\nI know some games already feature this mechanic to an extent by having the game world reflect a certain holiday, if the game world's lore recognizes the holiday, either called the same thing or some other name.  Back in my Brony days, I played the My Little Pony mobile game, and it featured the mechanics to change the world to a Halloween theme (for the world's holiday ""Nightmare Night"") or Christmas theme (""Hearth's Warming"").\n\n\n*The Eyes of Ara* used a similar mechanic to, again, feature extra puzzles related to Halloween and Christmas.  If they can do that, I'm sure they could make it so when you're playing at night, it's night in the game.  If you're playing in the middle of the afternoon, it's the same time in the game.\n\n\nStraw-grasping, I know, but still, I think it'd be kind of cool."
kb1bqe,Game idea,"Ok so, you are a player with very limited, you can only see a bit ahead of you, behind and above. There are some items or intractables which show you more stuff, maybe like a ripped up map. But the interesting part is that each time you die, everything you saw in the previous life can be see from anywhere. I don’t really know how to explain it more, if anyone wants to take the idea and make a game, dm me it. I would love to see this happen, I just don’t know how to code. Add more suggestions in the comments."
kaxrma,Space bounty hunters!,"You might have guessed that I’m binge watching the Mandalorian, which I am. It’s great. But I can only see Disney capitalising on some big story driven game that just uses the theme to sell the title.\n\nWhat we all deserve is to man our own ship. Take jobs from across the galaxy, negotiating with the scum and using our hard earned money to ensure enough supplies to get us to the next job. And yeah sure, if you get the big payout you could buy a nice little upgrade for your ship, or perhaps your own equipment. But mostly I want to feel the hardship of trying to get by in the wide expanse of space. \n\nFTL does come to mind when writing this. But imagine having to land your ship, walking in to a dusty scrap town and meeting with some low life  gang to negotiate a job. Not knowing if your walking out of the meeting with an upfront payment in hand.. or your blaster.\n\nA selection of vessels and characters to mix up play styles.. but we all know we are going to play a Beskar wearing gun slinger.\n\nI don’t have the ability to make this. But maybe someone else can."

kan9h8,Star Wars Open World,"\nOk I don’t know if this idea has been said but I’ve been thinking of it a lot lately.\nA GTA V style of Star Wars where you can go through a campaign that would mostly be a tutorial, and then an Online mode\nIn the Online mode you would spawn on one of a set number of planets (which you’d be able to choose like Ark) where you can build up your life and character and do anything you could imagine, like create crime syndicates, join together to create/ overthrow different armies and clans, etc\nOfc you would either be non force sensitive or very low level in ability to make the game more fun and better RP \nAnd there could be like different types of serves like Old republic, The prequel Era republic, Empire, and Resistance Era servers\nDo you guys like this idea/ any criticism?"

ka9d2m,WW2 FPS video game idea with old school quickscoping,"I have this cool idea for a FPS game that could be created, I have very minimal game design knowledge but if I could get a group of people and start a discord server and we could try to create this game. My idea is a WW2 themed game with WW2 weapons and locations. I really want old school quickscoping in this game as it used to be my favorite thing. Could have cool gamemodes that can have a range of 10 players (5v5) all the way up to 20 players (10v10) I think this is a cool idea and if anyone is interested or would like to see this game come to life that would be so cool this has been a dream of mine for a while now. This is not just a call of duty game I want to have call of duty like weapon play but all new gamemodes and maps and class systems. Please let me know about anything that you think is bad about this game idea I really appreciate it. Hopefully this game idea could come too life."
ka3k3z,"A multiplayer haunted house game in which AI demons will kill you and possess your body to kill the rest of your team. You can can avoid getting killed by demons by staying quiet on the mic and moving carefully, but then your teammates might kill you thinking you had been possessed.","You walk a fine line between not getting killed by the AI demons and not scaring your teammates into thinking you were killed and are now being controlled by the AI. If you cry out for help over voice chat or voice commands, you might get killed by the AI, but if you stay too quiet while you approach your teammates for group safety, they might kill you with their melee weapons instead.\n\n****\nThe premise is stupid simple: Self-proclaimed demon hunters from across Instagram group up to YOLO some abandoned hospital/mansion/gravesite/ect. (depending what map got chosen)... all to take selfies at randomized locations there ""for the gram."" Unbeknownst to them, demons are real. Real *vicious.* And now the influencers must split up to take their selfies as fast as possible before a portal to hell opens up ^(or someshit —I don't know, I haven't thought this far ahead.

ka3cx6,Cringe Simulator,"Every level gets increasingly more cringe-inducing. Kind of like running the gauntlet cringe edition, but in game form.

ka3709,Would this seem like a rip-off,"So for a long time I have kind of been questioning if I want to be a game designer so recently I have been imagining if my game company became big enough to make a console and stuff. \n\nBut a problem arises when it comes to avatars, avatars are something I want to do (no question) but my problem is that of should I make games based off of these avatars the reason this may seem like a rip off is of course the Wii series and their resemblance \n\nSome game ideas would consist of one such as a game called “(Insert word) island” where you can hang out with your avatars and get to know them.\n\nAnyways let me know if this is a rip-off and/or what can I do to change it. Sorry for the long post"
