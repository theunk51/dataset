gpdmbz,Roasting Game,"An app like Omegle how you video chat random people, but the whole point is to roast the other person. So one person would have maybe a minute to talk while the other is muted, then it switches. You could choose to be a participant or a judge, and the judge picks who wins at the end of the game. Then you’d level up based on your wins so you’re up against better people. I have a plan to promote it that I’m confident could get alot of people on it. Message me if interested."
gpd0np,[REQUESTING FEEDBACK] I have two very similar game ideas and I want to know which one you guys prefer.,"So I have a game idea for a sidescroller combat adventure game, and I want to know which version of it sounds more fun to you guys...\n\nThe game will start in a small town... You're there with one NPC. You have a small house and the NPC has a small house located right next door. You step outside your house and as far as you can see there's a run-down town with a bunch of busted up buildings and nobody but you and this one NPC are there... You get more NPCs to move in by finding them along your journey and performing actions to move them in. You may or may not be required to rebuild their buildings before this can be done... Here's where I need your advice, which of these two sounds more fun:\n\n1. There's a small cave in the town which is shrouded in mystery... The one NPC hints at it a bit, but otherwise you know nothing about it... Inside is where most of the game takes place... You enter with absolutely nothing, on ""area"" #1... You are greeted by enemies and things as you attempt to progress ""room"" by ""room"" You collect materials along the way and use them to craft weak weaponry and armor to aid you along your journey, until you reach the end of the floor and you're greeted by a boss. If you defeat the boss you move on to the next floor, if you die to the boss (or to anything before the boss) you are sent back to the town, losing nearly all of your progress (With the only exception being certain currencies which can be used in the town...) You find NPCs in the caves sometimes and need to perform actions to free them, having them move into your town above and letting you interact with them up there, using things you find in the cave... Some NPCs will give you tasks like ""kill x number of this enemy"" or ""find my axe and return it to me"" and they will reward you with permanent items that can be found in the cave on later runs, or recipes which allow you to craft more powerful weapons to make each run slightly easier than the last. The game goes on like this, eventually you'll have rebuilt the town and freed all the NPCs, you'll have reached the deepest depths of the cave, you'll have defeated many bosses, and you'll have unlocked many items...\n2. There's no cave in the town, rather, the town is in the middle of a very very large world... It's surrounded by ""areas"" which have different functions, and you can go to any of these areas at any time without limitation, except areas that are intended to be explored later on will have more difficult enemies and require stronger equipment to collect things from... I'm not sure exactly how this will look, but I assume each area will have materials on their surfaces which can be collected... Some will have mineral deposits which require a certain pickax to mine, some will have wood, some will simply have rare enemies that drop materials when killed... You progress somewhere along the lines of ""go to the forest, chop some wood, make some wooden armor and a sword, go to the mine, collect some copper and iron, upgrade your pic so it can mine stronger materials, upgrade your weapons and armor with these new materials, maybe you'll find some loot along the way and now you're able to double jump and dash, fight your first boss, it will drop an upgraded bow, use some of the drops to make stronger arrows, now you're strong enough to venture into a harder land, kill some enemies, collect some new materials, upgrade your equipment again, rescue an NPC, etc, etc"" This form of progression would probably look something like Terraria's progression system, but it will be much harder for me to balance and design considering the environment isn't destructible like it is in Terraria... It would be a very new genre of game I feel, but hard for me to design...\n\nWhich of these sounds more fun for you guys to play? If you chose option #2, how do you suggest I go about designing it to make it as fun as possible? Thanks in advance, I look forward to hearing Y'all's ideas!"
gpblfx,A Racing Game where all of the Cars are terrible.,"So instead of driving Ferraris, Lamborghinis, Porsches, Corvettes, etc, etc. You get stuff like the AMC Gremlin, Mustang ii, Chevy Vega, etc, etc."
gpa17t,A game idea,"The game’s about you saving the kingdoms of your fictional world. Each kingdom has their own theme such as a grass kingdom, water kingdom, a fire kingdom, etc. Each kingdom has a problem that you must solve. For example, the grass kingdom might have their trees cut down or on fire, the fire kingdom could be flooded or the water kingdom could have their water drowned. You can choose what kingdom you do in any order."
gp9feb,One developer game ideas,"Hi everyone!\nI'm desperately looking for a cool, simple game idea for a school project that I can implement by myself in about 3 months. \nI'm really not that creative and I'd appreciate any help/ideas/storylines! (I was thinking maybe a horror game?)"
gp5mh2,an rpg where everything is a consumable (kinda),"so in some ways this is a normal turn based rpg (leveling systems, skills and party members, the usual) but there is a feature that changes the way you play.\n\nnothing lasts.\n\neverything from weapons to armor to jewelery only lasts for a small amount of time. weapons break after a few attacks, armor breaks after getting hit a few times, rings only last a few battles, etc.\n\nthis means that no matter how precious your favorite equipment is it will never last forever, meaning that you can't stick to one set of equipment.\n\neven spells don't last too long, they're either scrolls or books that have limited uses.\n\nand thats basically the idea, it's probably been done before but i think its at least kinda novel."
gp58fa,Westworld RPG,"**Gameplay Phase 1:**\n\nThe game begins with you arriving at the train station. You will pick white hat or black hat. \n\n1. Black hat: You will be impulsed to shag everything that comes across you, but this takes away your stamina. Your goal is to recover stamina through various means so you can remain in the game for as long as possible.\n2. White hat: Remain a virgin. \n\nAlright, we'll give you one person in the entire park that is willing to suck your dick, you'll have to go through all the quest to find that person before you totally go blue.\n\n**Gameplay Phase 2:**\n\nThe AIs regain their memory.  \n\n**KILL THEM ALL! 😡**"
gp3yym,A game in which you train your AI companions.,"You have two AI companions with you at all times, who you give orders to. You can tell them where to take cover, which enemies to fire on, when to use their unique abilities, what weapons to use, etc. At the start of the game, they will be novices, and difficult to manage. They may move without you ordering them, or misunderstand an order, they may not be proficient with their weapon, etc. As the game goes on, though, they will learn from how you order them, and try to automatically act in a way similar to the way you've directed them in the past. If you always tell them to flank, for example, they'll start flanking without being told, or if you tell them to search areas often, they will search areas on their own, and find more, etc. Sometimes, they'll do something without being asked that actually benefits you. If they do, you can praise them, which will teach them to do that more often. And conversely, if they act out of line, you can scold/discipline them, and they will make that mistake less. I'm envisioning this within an RPG shooter, but it could apply to whatever."
gp3jfb,I need help with my game idea!,"Hello!\n\nI've recently been working on an idea for a life-simulation RPG with a simple concept: your character moves into a small town hidden from the rest of the world where you befriend the townsfolk and live your best life.\n\nThe game is heavily inspired by Stardew Valley as I find the story behind it very inspiring. It's the reason I got interested in game development myself. However, I don't want to make a clone of the game and call it a day. I want to move away from the farming and put the focus on something else. However, without the whole part about running a farm, what else could I implement to fill the void?\n\nMy first idea was to center the game around character interactions and building friendships which eventually lead to romance. But if I just want to make everything about the social aspect, I could just make a visual novel, right? Well, that's not my goal.\n\nWhat I want to create is a small world with charming and relatable characters. A game where you can disappear in this small world for a few hours and enjoy your time. But I DO NOT want to make another farming sim.\n\nSo, what kind of things would you want to be able to do in a game to keep you playing? Fishing? Minigames? Running a local business? (And if so, which kind of business?) Any idea or feedback is appreciated!\n\n*Sorry for any grammar mistakes, English is not my first language.*"
gp1imc,Real-life pokedex!,"This might not be the best place to post as I'm currently building the MVP myself, but I thought that would be a great way to brainstorm and get feedbacks as I don't really know where this project might go. \n\nWhen I was playing early Pokemon games I've always be fascinated by the Pokedex. I could spend  a lot of time just staring at it and going through the list of Pokemons I catched or just saw in the world. It gave me a weird feeling of satisfaction, and I recently noticed that my gf (and a lot of people) had the same kind of thing with the Museum in Animal Crossing. \n\nAnyways, I later became a data scientist specialized in computer vision and I've been dreaming of a real-life Pokedex based on computer vision for years. Now is a time where accuracy is high enough to be able to detect very specific objects like plant or animal species via your phone camera, among almost any other object, in near real-time. \n\nRight now I have an app that lets you look for a rabbit (I test it with my domestic rabbit Carlos lol) with your phone camera. When you tap on the screen, it extracts the object that is the very front of the image via DeepLab, and then calls Google Vision API to check if that object is indeed a rabbit (by checking if the confidence of the object being a rabbit is above 98% threshold). It just works perfectly, smoothly, every time! So I'm now adding more objects. \n\nBottom line is that I don't know where this might go: should this just be an app that lets you collect real life items like animals? Or could it be more than that? You could actually imagine that by snapping a rabbit or any other object, it adds the object in your inventory and then you could just use it in a virtual world. Might even be a PC game where the phone is just used to collect things in real-world. \n\nA friend of mine is a very experienced unity game dev and wants to jump with me on this project, but the possibilities are just endless and we don't know what path would be the best to take from here. I have plenty of time and want to dedicate it on this for at least the next 6 months.\n\nDo you think it's worth it? Would you play such a ""game""? Would love to do some brainstorming around this! Thanks for reading and sorry for the long post, it's my first one on Reddit and I hope I did not break any rules here..."
gozbg8,MOBILE GAME IDEA,I have an idea for a mobile app similar to Omegle. (by that I mean it involves video chats with random people) but there’s a different more fun point to it. I need someone who can develop it. Message me if interested and I’ll elaborate more.

goxba2,Mobile game idea. Need someone who can develop it.,I have and idea for an idle style mobile game. I have literally no experience or knowledge when it comes to app or game development but I think it would be kind of complex to make so looking for someone a little more experienced.

gowb0x,INFINITE TRAIN,"I would like to play a game that was like an infinite train and that each wagon has a certain number of enemies and it becomes more and more difficult with each wagon you overcome, and when you die you can improve your weapons, buy weapons and so on. start again, also that there were more types of trains ... too bad there is no game like this :("
govb4g,Side scrolling obstacle traversing concept. Recording walk/jump movement separately with macros.,"Simple side scrolling game with a target to reach portal by traversing obstacles.\n\nRecording movement separately in stages using macros, such as walk mode first then jump mode later. \n\nWalk Mode\n\n* Start each level in this mode\n* player can only walk left or right.\n* moving left or right records a macro.\n* hitting obstacles or reaching ledges will stop the player but not effect the macro.\n* Pressing space bar will end The walk mode and stop macro.\n* Pressing 1 will restart walk mode.\n\nJump Mode\n\n* After stopping walk mode macro countdown to jump mode begins.\n* Jump mode can only go up or down.\n* As the macro plays and moves in the recorded path the player times jumps to traverse the course.\n* Entering the portal begins the next level.\n* Pressing 2 will restart Jump Mode.\n* Pressing 1 will restart the entire level.\n\nMore Controls, harder obstacles can be added to increase difficulty.\n\nSuch as needing to climb and move backwards will make restarting the entire level necessary. Not just holding forward the entire walk mode and will require some trial and error.\n\nExtra hard mode after beating the game could be jump mode first, think about the pain. Speed run leader boards could be created too."
gouwsu,A strategy game based on nomadic lifestyle,"It could be cool to have a strategy game where your success depends on how well you can lead your people group or tribe by moving around instead of expanding the geographical borders. You would have to think in a very different way than traditional strategic games.\n\nYou can prosper through trading, herding animals, hunting, fighting other people groups or a combination of these. A big part of the game would be to know when you need to move, at what pace and also how you should deal with other tribes or even towns. Other nomadic groups have their own routines, and you can either respect their travelling patterns and avoid conflict or confront them.  \n\nYou also need to have a good knowledge of the land, to take most advantage of the resources. Weather patterns play a role, and if you stay too long in one place the food in that area will deplete. However, moving too early is a risk as well.\n\nThe game is very cyclical and it is hard to progress and become huge as you never stay permanently in one place for long. Instead, for each year you gain points depending on how well that year went. The better you manage to find a good routine and adapt to the surroundings year by year, the better you score. \n\nDifficulty can be adjusted by adjusting AI behaviour and advantages, and also how rough the nature on your map is.\n\nInteresting dilemmas that can occur during a game are:\n\n- Should we follow the same route as last year, or take our chances to take another route?\n\n- Should we stay on lands we know well, or explore new lands?\n\n- How should we act when meeting other groups?\n\n- What is our main source of food?\n\n- Should we stay as one big group, or split up?\n\nI picture it as a top- down view of a nice- looking map with a lot of layers to turn on and off to show important information about the land.\n\nI think it can be a cool game with these core mechanics, but to add flavor we can for example have different skills and traits on the people in the tribe. Some skills can influence how accurate the information on the map is, while other skills decides the food output or the fighting ability.\n\nIt could be either turn- based or RTS like Europa Universalis where you can control the speed and pause if needed. It could work as a multiplayer game, with players controlling a tribe each.\n\nWhat do you think? If there is allready a game like this, please let me know."

gotv91,Open world RPG Star Wars game.,"So Respawn, EA and Rockstar team together to make a GTA online style Star Wars game online with a lot of planets and key locations and you start just as a normal person on a planet of your choice and you choose your path to the light or the dark or in the middle you can be mandolorian, a smuggler, a bounty hunter, a stormtrooper, a Sith Lord, an inquisitor or a Jedi. In this game you can choose you own personal droid and ship if you are a Sith Lord you can build you fleet. Obviously in this game the rule of two won’t be in place other wise the first 2 people to become Sith Lords would be overpowered. And that all I can think of now please comment any suggestions."
gotdc2,A Friday The 13th The Game style Hunger games game,"There wouldn’t be an actual story, just an online game where you can play as unlock able characters from the movies and books. You could also compare it to COD.\n\nEdit: it’s a battle royale."
gop6ol,Dream Middle Earth Game Idea!,"TLDR: Basically an open world RPG set in all of Middle Earth where you could chose your own gender, class, race and decide to be good or evil. \n\nMy dream game would be an open world RPG set in Middle Earth (Maybe developed by CD Projekt Red) Where you create your own character, male or female, elf, dwarf, human, or halfling, and you chose a backstory when you make your character (similar to Cyberpunk 2077) \n\nSome examples of options you could chose: \n\n\- The spoiled son of a king, destined to take his fathers throne. \n\n\- A messenger who gets caught up in the political drama and war.\n\n\- A character who somehow gains magical abilities which he uses either to bring peace or destruction. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe story you chose would affect your political stance and power in the world, it would also affect the characters you meet and how they would react to you. For example if you were the spoiled son of a king and you went to a neighbouring kingdom with which the king once quarrelled, the people would have hatred towards you and the dialogue would be different. \n\nYou could also chose your class, whether it’s archer, knight, assassin, healer/necromancer, and you could chose to be good or evil which would result in the story branching off and ending differently.\n\nMaybe you could also chose companions to join you and create a Fellowship 🧐 where each companion would have different abilities similar to Dragon Age Inquisition. \n\nI loved the Middle Earth games by Monolith but they were only set in Mordor and I would like to see the other areas in Middle Earth explored as well. Such as, Hobbiton, Rivendell, Moria, Lothlorien, Minas Tirith, Isengard, Edoras, Harad, The Misty Mountains, Lake Town, Etc... Imagine an open world where you could travel from The Shire all the way Mount Doom or the Iron Hills 😭 Imagine exploring the open world on a mount of your choice (horse, eagle, warg?) and you enter a dungeon or open field where you come across a dragon, a stone giant, or a Mumakil 😦 \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis game sounds way too ambitious but if someone made it they would make a stupid amount of money and it would be talked about for generations. WHY HAS NO ONE MADE THIS YET."

gomssj,A pixel game?,Does anyone have any ideas for a pixel game for my second game?
gol5g1,Rogue Oil Extractor,"In this game the player will take the part of a Rogue Oil Extractor. The goal will be to extract as much oil as possible from regions whose governments have not given you permission to extract that oil. This will play out like a tower defense game. The player will drop oil rigs and defense turrets in key points on the map. The opposition's response will start small but gradually ram up. For example the opposition would start with police and angry citizens, upgrade to general infantry, then to specialist infantry, then to portable field guns, then to tanks and attack helicopters. Different turrets and mines will exist do deal with these threats. When the threat level of the opposition gets too strong the player can bug out with the oil they have extracted.\n\nThe money from selling the oil can be used to buy new turret types and upgrades to give the player's defense a better chance against higher tier enemies. The game play instance's variables like cover, number of oil wells, type of opposition, and ramp up speed will be determined by where the player chooses to go on a world map. While the player is not forced to go to low oil, low response areas when they start the game, it should become obvious that they will be able to get money quicker from these areas until they upgrade their turret arsenal.\n\nFundamentally this is an amoral game about an amoral practice. The player will be using automated defense drones and oil extraction tools to enrich themselves while extracting a resource that belong to the very people the player is killing. Naturally the earlier levels will take place in the middle east, but since I am one for irony the higher tier extraction and opposition levels would be in , Asia, Europe, and the Americas. Late game content would mean growing so powerful that you could slap down oil extractors in the middle of Washington DC. Then hold off the might of the US military long enough to extract a small fortune in oil."
gokvqh,an actual jedi academy and order game.,"I just finished watching a video by looper thay went over the jedi orders ranks, roles a person can play on the jedi order, and jobs they perform. Anything from archivists to knights, explorers and scientists, even medics, doctors and assassins. Jedis that just travel the universe to gain knowledge and even of course jedi that helps represent governments and certain factions the jedi order supports. \n\nBasically you start off as a youngling who was recruited by the jedi order as an infant, learn and grow in all different types of skills to become a Padawan, jedi knight, jedi master, grand Master. And all the roles and jobs you can choose to support the jedi order. If done as an open world, open space, RPG with many many different branching paths. It would be a monster of a game. Disney has the resources to do something like this with a game developer. They should."

gohvnc,Hear me out.......," Hear me out.......Titanfall 3, but it’s actually advertised and released at a sensible time. Brilliant right?"
gohjkz,Futuristic MMORPG/FPS,"I had this idea after thinking about Ready Player One for 3-4 days and it goes like this: \n\nThe game is set above the clouds with major cities but all of them set on platforms. While technically an open world, it’s not your typical open world (I’m sure you understand why) and the players have to choose between different types of characters that all relate to the army (i.e. nurse, soldier, Seal, etc.).\n\n(The final goal would be to run it in vr but I’m still not sure about this part...)\n\nThe story goes a little like this, although I haven’t given it much thought yet... You are just coming back from a mission and you are greeted, some controls are explained, bla bla bla. You’re constantly receiving orders from a “person” but you don’t know who it is and it is later revealed that it is God. You finally understand your purpose (saving the planet earth) when one of your missions is to go to earth and collect data. This is at this moment that you learn that you are an angel.\n\nSome things omitted but that’s my game idea. \n\nAlso, what would be cool is the possibility of running shops and stuff like that instead of NPCs"
goh47z,Game Idea,"So, I had this idea in an actual dream. The game was to not know which keyboard keys did what and you would have to press all the keys to figure it out and complete the task for the level. The level would be timed and if you did not press the buttons in time, the level would restart and you would need to try again. You would then proceed onto a different level once you have figured out what button to press. As the game continued, the tasks would get more difficult and you would have to utilize skills that you have learned before, press buttons that you have previously learned what they did to complete the tasks needed. The moral of the game would be that sometimes in life you need to fail so that you can eventually succeed."

gofin9,"Your ""ideas"" are not ideas.",A game idea is mostly about the mechanics of the game.\nA game about pirates with just one mechanic and an entire essay about the story doesn't help much.\nIs it open world? Is it a puzzle? Action? Turn based game? What is it?
gofabz,"Sense my last post didn't go so well I think this could become a game Maybe, It's a 50/50 shot but I'm gonna go for it, it's a short horror story I wrote when I was 15.","It was a dare for the record books. Anyone who took it was labeled clinically insane by their friends, and would have to be carted away to an insane asylum.\n\nBut if anyone was insane that day, it was Thomas Schwartz (known as Tommy to his friends). He not only volunteered to do it, but he was going to do it alone.\n\nStanding in the driveway of the house, he stands confident. His eyes shift from window to door, seeking out weaknesses.\n\nIf he was scared, he didn’t show it. Ignoring the cheers of his accomplices, he advanced towards his opponent. The sounds of a lawn mower hitch a ride with the breeze, engulfing the children as they hold position.\n\nThe driveway found itself losing a war with the grass, and the boundary where they separated became unclear. Tommy didn’t notice this; his mind was focused upon his goal, and what lay ahead. Cicadas argued with each other while the birds sang the aria of summer, but all of this was lost as Thomas step on the wood steps underneath his feet moaned with the effort from supporting him.\n\nWith the doorbell non-functioning, and no welcome mat to accommodate him, Tommy pried open the screen door (who also had some complaining to do), and reached for the brass knob. As his thumb began pushing down the lever, time held its breath in anticipation.\n\nHis friends had long ceased their cheers, and merely stood where it was safe, letting the sun extract sweat from their pores. Even the birds and the cicadas had paused in their conversation to study him. The door wailed as it allowed him entry, and again when the house had engulfed him.\n\nWith the door in-between his friends and him, the fear crept into his face. The path to being a schoolyard legend certainly isn’t the easiest. Nothing had shambled into sight clanking chains, though that didn’t alleviate Thomas’s fears. His goal resided on the second story, and the faster he made it there, the less likely he would end up killed by horrors unknown.\n\nWith every fiber of his being resisting him, Thomas advanced through the house. The echo of his footfall seemed to resonate throughout the entire house as they collided with the carpet which had cushioned the heads of the three families that lived there.\n\nUpon passing the foyer, white sheeted figures assaulted his vision, making him leap. However, the furniture did not attack, perhaps not hungry for small children. As his heart safely descended from his throat, Thomas had reinforced his nerves, and began walking again.\n\nThe stairs curved at a sharp turn in the middle. A small groan issued from Thomas as nightmarish scenarios played out in his mind. The fact that this particular staircase was used as a bowling alley for severed heads didn’t exactly appeal to him either.\n\nNo ghost could compare to the taunts and teases of his fellow colleagues however, so the staircase was only a minor nuisance. With each step, Thomas’s muscles tightened further, trying in vain to prevent the inevitable. His eyes forced his head to turn around the corner, his bowels bracing for release. Nothing came at him.\n\nNothing upon nothing erupted from the hallway. The nothing disemboweled him, and gouged his eyes out with extraordinary nonexistence. Ignoring the ball of snakes squirming in his bowels, Thomas approached the far door on the right; the final destination.\n\nThomas couldn’t decide whether or not the doors in the hallway being closed were a blessing or a curse. Shifting horror may lurk in the folds of the unknown, but since they didn’t attack, he didn’t bother himself with spooking himself. The goal was too close in sight to chicken out.\n\nThomas stretched his hand out to the knob of the final room, and as he did so, the knob shrank from it. Yet, the door screamed at him and he entered the room. The accursed painting was on the far wall, as if expecting him; beckoning him closer into itself, as it had done to so many others.  \nThomas couldn’t feel his flesh, Nor his eyes blinking, his going deeper and deeper into the darkness. He feels something crawling under his skin. Its making him… Nervous.  He feels like his being held to his back. He still feels cold,and unhappy. This feeling he’s getting is… dreadful.  \nThe darkness is consuming him. His feeling is, very very dark, the demons are controlling his emotions now Like. His hurting,more and more, feeling like someone he never has. His feeling like a psychopath. Like someone hurt him, like someone was gonna kill him.  \nHe felt this blood on the back of his neck, even though it was not real. It felt real. To him he felt like he was gonna die. He felt like he never would have died. But he almost did die. But he died. (New stuff) He woke up an hour later. He woke up, an hour or so later.  \nHe had so many scratches and bruises, It was like a demon scratched him. Or multiple demons.  \nOr dogs,or cats Thomas felt this weird urge of guilt. He didn’t mind it though, he felt happy that he could forget it. But some people can’t forget what happens after that shit. He has been through too much, he can’t turn back now.  \nNext he got up, found a first aid kit. And put bandaids on his wounds. He kept going thru the house,he still didn’t Mind being called Insane and going to the insane asylum, he knew he would be going there, But at this point, he didn’t give a shit,if he turned around, he would pretty much be attacked again. Most likely. What was going thru his head, was. Don’t turn around. He kept going straight,he found the ladder “To hell” as people called it,that survived, But nobody did, he just saw the sign painted in blood,or it Looked like blood. But it was most likely fake blood,or some sort of… Paint or,dead rats blood  \nHe went up there anyways despite the rumors. He didn’t care. All he cared about was going thru this ending. He ran up the stairs, but it was never ending,he remembered, Playing mario 64,he thought about doing what mario did,you basically do is,run backwards, or walk. He did just that, it didn’t work.  \nSo he felt the walls. He found a door. He looked down stairs, he went up a lot of stairs. He couldn't even find out. Were It was The door he opened looked dark, he remembered he carried a flashlight. He couldn’t get it to work,so next. He had to just wing it. He went it and found a light switch.   \nHe felt the same thing… Scratching his legs, he saw a dead rat. It had its head Cut off.   \nHe looked at it like it was food. He was Hunger, he had to eat something. So he took it and swallowed it whole. He was still hungry, and the nails. He spent the nails out of it. In the closet, he found a clown costume.   \nHe thought it might be a killer clown, he didn’t know. He found a hatchet, and a shotgun. He took the shotgun Recardles. Of the shotgun, not having any ammo. The hatchet,was not broke though, he kept that. Just in case. The demons,and the rats came after him.  \nHe kept his eyes, opened and wide. He felt different, after all he felt like a clown or rats were gonna go after him. He thought the headless creatures would keep scratching his legs. Even though they were numb. He still knew about them scratching his legs.   \nHe finally found some ammo. For his shotgun, and he still kept the fucking hatchet, He didn’t wanna waste ammo on them, but if it was a monster rat. Then maybe he would use the shotgun. He thought *I might be fucked. But if I am I might as well go without silence.* He kept running through the house.   \nThe house seemed bigger then he looked outside the window. No one was outside. He got weirded out. He looked directly at the image of the dead people he saw, they were in a small, yet big box, full of screams and fire."
goeie4,Where can I take my ideas without them being blatantly taken?,"As the title says. I need a platform where I can express my ideas and plans, get feedback, but somehow be protected from my game idea just being straight up stolen."

Like wally west, becomes a flash (Sept kid flash) Sept he changes his suit color to Red/yellow (a red-ish yellow) and then Cisco and Irish (IF SHE'S OUT OF THE FUCKING MIRROR), lead him like the flash, Sept this flash can't die... His name would be Red-kid-Flash, and he faces, Red death, and all the people the flash couldn't beat (Or in the tv-show/wasn't in the tv show) and there's a chapter from where... You are the flash trying to become alive again, and try to go back, and once he comes back, that chapter ends (It would be a multiple chapters thing Kinda) and then you can keep playing Because all the damn chapters are done.  \n\n\nsecond chapter (7-10 hours): The flash (Barry Allen) And red flash/kid flash (Wally West) Final meet. then they hear an energy alert Then they say ""We should handle that"" then they start fighting and Keep fighting Until they find another person they can't face (Or multiple if You wanna go down that route) and they Keep fighting them, One of them time travel (You have a choice but this time you don't) You run thru time, and have to keep running straight, and if You see things (That have happened in the past of the game) You can't stop, You have to keep running, or You will fuck up the time line... So if You keep going and he finds out He FUCKED UP THE TIMELINE (Big surprise) and then the chapter ends.3rd chapter: Once he finds out a DIFFERENT jay Garrick comes and drags him back, In the main time, and before he goes he says ""Remember, there are concusses to time travel use it responsibly"" Which he has a point, If You Time travel, You fuck with time...  (Big surprise) Then You defeat the bad-guy, Then You find out there are more (Like the ones that WHERE Rumored to me in the TV show (red death, Maybe cicada as an older dude more fucked up but You know) Then once they fight/try to kill (older cicada) Then The flash gets Shot (By his dagger) Then they get flash goes thru buildings until he Makes it to star-labs, They heal him and find a SMALL piece of the fragment dagger, Then they find out this Cicada, is the most powerful one they know) Then once they find out That, Chapter ends.  \n\n\nChapter 3 (7-8 hours): They find out more bad guys are coming out and they are the same as every other bad guy. Just More powerful/different (Skin color, hair all that) And they are more powerful (Mist has: Fire with mist.  \nMirror, has a Fire/laser eye while still going into mirrors so he can break them now..  \nZoom: comes back as a MAJOR lead character, as a Faster zoom then the last... He stole all the other flashes speed, Including jay Garrick) So... With zoom, You can put him into the last fight, SEPT he has someone working with him, Savitar, Who Helped zoom get More speed, (Same amount of speed as him, sept he has a LITTLE bit more, Because his an alley) And then zoom comes to star-labs, and steals the flashes speed. (Not all of it But a good amount), Then the flash Loses most of his powers (Being able to freeze time and all that) Then they are in another predicament. Then It's up to wally west (red-kid-flash)  \n\n\nChapter 4 (4-8 hours): They find out, where Savitar, and Zoom are (There secret hide out) Then, Once they find them, they get caught one of them has to run away (You choose) Then one has to stay back and suffer, In a speed force That one of them made (Savitar) And they have to suffer. Then once You get them out, Someone has to stay, Then one person comes in (Reverse flash) and then you and your partner have to Fight the reverse flash. Then once you guys defeat him, You guys RUN as fast as You can out of there and You Close the door, and He has to suffer...   \n\n\nChapter 5 (7-8 hours): You guys get out of the speed force and to the lab, (The speed force where people go thru) Then You find Them, Sept they all are killed (Not murdered, so You have a chance to save Irish, and Cisco, But they die Until... Drum roll They weren't the real Cisco and Irish. They were fakes set up by cicada, He wanted you to feel empty, Your characters cry Until, Cisco and Irish come back, Cisco makes a joke and goes ""Bro what the fuck... Is this some joke, or is this how you guys really feel about us"" Then wally and Barry tell them it wasn't a joke, someone tried to make them Feel weaker.  \n\n\nchapter 6 Final chapter (9-10 hours): They ""Kill""/get zoom/Savitar And they are set up in the same cell. Until one of them Gets out from one of them (Savitar) Gets himself out of the cell, And then zoom Gets pissed, so... He stays in the cell Then the flash, Steals all zooms speed (I know fucked up) But he feels faster, he can't control it (the running/vibrating) So, He Shares the speed with kid flash... So they are the same speed (Kinda Because kid flash still as his speed, so yeah) and How they stole the speed of zoom, They did what he did to the flash (Grab a needle/pen) And steal his speed. Then once they have the speed, they go after Savitar, Savitar says ""I see you gotten faster flash and red-kid-flash, This is gonna be fun"" And then he runs, faster then them, and then once The flash Gets mad and almost kills him he says something ""IF YOU KILL ME YOU BECOME ME"" Then, He doesn't kill him... He Throws him in a cell again, and they keep a CLOSE eye on him... Because Savitars double ganger could come after him again... Then it ends... And it says ""TO BE CONTINUED""  \n\n\nI know it's not THE BEST idea but that's what I got.  \nNote you can add chat dialog (Because that's what is needed)   \nIf You are willing to give me Money for this Idea, Hmu on Reddit, I'm down to sell it to you."

gobcem,An alien trying to return home...,"So the start would be a cut-scene where a super technologically-advanced alien crash lands on Earth in prehistoric times with no way of reaching home. The only piece of gear retained from the wreckage is a short-range communicator/translator and a handheld device that allows the alien to change appearance into other life-forms.  \n\n\nPremise: Starting at the dawn of the time of humans/humaniods on Earth, this alien slowly seeds humans with technological advances by integrating into the population and teaching them something to advance the human race. This would take place by making each level or objective a different important advancement in actual history (fire/wheel for Neanderthals, gunpowder with the Chinese, nuclear fission in WWII Germany, etc). As you play, you see that the alien(and subsequently the player), living as a famous person in history, was actually the one making all these advancements and he lives throughout time, changing his appearance at the end of the ""life"" of the person he portrays.  \n\n\nThis would slowly build up to the point at which the alien could reveal himself and thank mankind for their contribution as his shoots off into space towards his home planet.  \n\n\nI know this game would almost certainly have to be AAA to achieve the level of historical accuracy, cultural details and assets needed to pull something like this off, but I think it'd be cool as heck. Could also make for a good TV show or movie series..."

go5cra,A stealth assassination game where you can kill people by attacking their shadows.,"This is my first time posting here so sorry if I make any common blunders.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is only a single game mechanic that I thought had a lot of potential for expansion. If the player is able to touch an enemy's shadow, regardless of distance, the enemy will immediately die. Perhaps if the shadow is too opaque or blurry the ability will not work. It seems like a great way to give insensitive to hiding in the shadows while also being active in game-play."

Each visit to that URL by anyone that plays the game earns the owner some gold. Websites can be stolen from other players \n\nGold can eventually buy a Tavern, which is a URL of the players choice that acts as a place for other players to go get their HP back. It's great advertising for the owner of the tavern if they want to advertise a personal website they made, youtube video or Reddit post, etc-- in this way it functions similarly to Pokestops, particularly when they are in the location of a business.\n\nThoughts?"

The kid falls asleep. Shortly after, dad falls asleep too. \nCUT! \nHe wakes up. His daughter is no longer there. It’s dark, no one is on the train except him. \nIt looks like a nightmare. \nThe objective of the game is finding the girl, and put an end to the nightmare. \n\n**Mechanics:**\n\nIt’s dark. The player has just a flashlight, and its battery depletes. He can search around and find additional batteries. \n\nHe moves in only one direction, since he was in the last cabin. \n\nSince it’s a nightmare, the cabins behave weirdly. Some of them grow longer while you walk, some of them rotate, with all the luggage moving and falling inside. Stuff like that. \n\nI wonder: \n\nThere should be enemies? How do I make them interesting with the flashlight mechanic? How can I use it in interesting ways? \n\nI can have invisible enemies that project shadows when illuminated, and that’s interesting, but i’m not sure where to go with this. \n\nAny advice, ideas, suggestions would be super cool (: thank you!"
gnzkty,A game where you control everything with morse code,"Maybe a puzzle platformer with the following commands: Walk, Run, Stop, Jump, Turn, Interact, Fire\n\nI would like to make every letter a command, but I can't think of something for some (Q, X, Y, Z)\n\nMaybe with short 2-3 letter keywords would be easier to include these letters.

gnsl5g,Color of Illusion (title I guess),"It's a simple game. You start in a room that's just completely white. So white that you cant tell where it begins or ends. On the floor is a little frame. On one side is an array of buttons, all but one are colorless. You press the colored button, and through the frame you see the door that leads to your freedom.\n\nThe game would rely on the use of the frame. It has the ability to see the colors of the world. The further through the game you go, the more colors you can see, more detail to the levels, more visual distinctions.\n\nEach level would have you learn the ways of a color. Maybe red signifies jumping from platform to platform. Green shows where the physical ground is. Purple indicates the sky and where the edges of trees or walls are. Things of that sort.\n\nAnd after the final level, which utilizes all the colors, you activate a permanent color mode, and you can explore the world without needing the frame. It can become a free roam open world, where colors blend and mix like paints on a canvas.\n\nKind of like The Witness, except instead of solving puzzles that involve connecting lines, you instead use the limited colors to find your way. \nAlso a bit like AntiChamber, where perception is key to solving the challenges given to you.\n\nIf you wanna attempt to make this reality, please do so to your hearts content.\n\nBut this is but a concept that only a madman could dream of, right?"

Reinforcement are heavier vehicles made to be Reinforcement for the Patrollers, they can take more of a beating and can seat 4, but they're slower than the Patrollers. And then there are the Juggernauts, these are really heavily armored vehicles that are made for large battles, they can seat 6 and are really slow.\n\n* The Enforcers a Private Army base gang that has locations in both cities. They patrol the Richer Neighborhoods in armor vehicles. Their colors are Dark Blues, and Black, with a Yellow Strip on the side of their vehicles.\n\n* The next gang is an African American gang called, ""The Sons of Saints."" they own the southeast part of Los Demonios. Their colors are Red, Black, and Silver.\n\n* Asesino is a Mexican American gang, they control the southwest part of Los Demomios. Their colors are Yellow, Red, and Black\n\n* Up north in Las Giocare is Distruttore, an Italian Mob that owns the strip. Their colors are White\n\n* In the malls of Las Giocare is the Mall Rats, a gang made up of young adults. Their colors are Purple, and Pink\n\n* In the country outside of Los Demonios is the Rednecks. A gang of rednecks.

Yeah, basically just that, but in a more urban setting."
gnojff,A sidescroller that’s only one level but the level is insanely long,"There seems to be a rise in sidescrolling games with the sole purpose of being rage inducing and irritating. So, I came up with my own idea.\n\nThe game is only one level long, but the one level is insanely long, at least a couple hours. There would be certain towns or stuff spread far and few between just to keep it interesting and to get certain items. Boss battles would happen while the character is still running through the level.\n\nDeath would set you back to the beginning after your health reaches zero, unless you have a specific item bought and one of the before mentioned towns. There’d also probably even be some side quests and characters you could help along the way that could help you with your goal(teleport you ahead by 2 minutes, making enemies slower, etc.).  \n\nOf course each character, enemy and boss would have its own unique design and element to keep the game interesting, and maybe there could even be a sidekick system where you can have a follower that buffs you. The protagonist’s objective for reaching the end of the level, I don’t know yet. Probably something mediocre that would piss off anyone playing the game, lol."

Killing something when the maximum amount has been reached will respawn the strongest of the currently enemies to make room for the newly killed one.\n\nThis makes you think twice about whether you want to kill the small mob in front of you or just evade/spar with it becuase you may cause a boss to respawn by killing it

Every RPG has the trope that you’re “the chosen one” and you can roam around and do anything you want, but not this game. This is set in the modern world, your character doesn’t matter, no one in the game cares who you are, you’re trapped in a cycle of work, the only thing to motivate you to keep playing the game is that you’re going to make a difference in this world, which (let’s be honest) you’re not. This isn’t really meant to be a fun experience, it’s supposed to be stressful and depressing. You’re bound by a terrible vehicle, and money. Yeah, it’d be fun to take a vacation, but are you really gonna save for two years to take some time off from work? Are you going to waste your money on a vehicle? Where are you going to go? How do you break out of the cycle? That’s all up to you. \n\n\nI’m just spitballing here, criticism is expected, accepted, and appreciated."

Each additional character would cost a dollar or you can unlock every character for 60$. There would be maps like the smash bros maps and game modes such as battle royale and a game mode where you team up to kill minions from various Nintendo games (koopas, goombas etc.) and work your way up to bosses like Ridley. I know this will never happen but I just wanted to put this somewhere."
gmvs90,"Games should have an option to turn off ""Forced Diversity,"" and if they select it they just turn every single NPC (including all the important characters!) into a copy of the player's character.","And if anyone decides to be a smart-ass about it and decides to play it through still, I'll just make the final boss die in one hit, roll credits, so that it's a big letdown for them.\n\nPlus it would benefit the speed-running community, since a final boss that dies in one hit allows for a faster completion time as well as creative and funny ways to deliver an over-the-top meme attack."

It could even have two factions and some mountain men ai. \nThe map wouldn't reduce in size as the game progresses but instead rely on random acid fog and AI attacks (who them have a proper tactical gear set).\nThere would be mainly woods with cool terrain but also some small primitive villages and structures. And the occasional military bunker, where AI spawns, and it would reward good loot but be very difficult to pull it off with the waves of AI."

gmq9gr,Mini games to make an idle game more fun?,"Looking for a way to make my idle game more than just clicking, something simpler than a Rubik's cube but not quite just [aimbooster.com](https://aimbooster.com) lol. Maybe a mini game where the pipes fit together, or something like creating one of those Cool Math Games pizzas and then finishing. Overall I want the process to be less boring than just clicking but also be very easy to execute and a little repetitive."
gmpyig,Weimar Republic setting.,"I don't really have any core ideas i just think it would be a nice setting that is rarely used for video games. But i do have some other ideas. Like if you have a store, you could make food cost a billion marks.\nOr you could show the political turmoil of the country and try to make sure hitler doesn't get elected. You could also play as the Freikorp putting down communist uprisings and vice versa. \n\nAnyways that concludes my rant about how many video games could be made about post WWI germany."
gmnv33,Anyone wanna help brainstorm for a game that’s similar to both For Honor and Overwatch?,"I came up with what I think is a solid idea for a game, design wise, and I was wondering if anybody wanted to brainstorm ideas for it, both for the type of world it would be, as well as characters.\n\nBasically, it’d be similar to For Honor by focusing in a 1v1 dueling system (though it would have modes like 2v2, 4v4, and even possibly an Infection/Manhunt mode), with the camera being fixed looking over the character’s shoulder from afar.  However, it would also have similarities to Overwatch, in that each character has a set of abilities that would go into cool down upon use, as well as their own personalities and designs.  I guess in a way, it’s also similar to Battlefront 2’s Heroes Vs Villains mode.  However, unlike Battlefront, each character would also have a powered up form for a short time, providing extra effects to the abilities as well as being simply stronger overall, until the timer goes down.\n\nProblem is that I’m pretty much drawing a blank as to what kind of world the game would take place, and by extension what the characters would look and be like.   I was wondering if anybody would be interested in partnering up for brainstorms on the subject.  Of course, that would mean that you’d get to make many of the characters as well, as well as many possible others, such as skins for said characters, possible interactions, and quite possibly the overall general ‘feel’ of the game’s world itself.\n\nIf anyone’s interested, you can simply comment below.  I have a Discord set up for it, though if you don’t use Discord we can work something out."
gmm96z,A mechanic I want to see for Assassin's Creed.,"Just to note, I'm not the biggest fan of Assassin's Creed, just thought of something that would greatly improve those games.\n\nWhat I'd call organic map exploration, no more towers to reveal the map, basically you'd have a radius around your character that would reveal the fog of war as you ran around, but the radius would increase as you climbed higher, to simulate your character being able to see more. You'd still have the incentive to climb to these high points, just without it being a necessary glorified collectible."
gmkj5a,Horror themed FPS/FPM called Night Warriors,"I thought of a horror themed FPS/FPM where the story is a special branch of the us government is tasked with finding and eliminating supernatural threats. The min focus would be on the multiplayer. Where you can play as different classes each with their own strength and weakness \n\nThe classes are as follows \n\nHumans: no special abilities or special weakness only class able to wield every type of weapon and armor \n\nWerewolf: they start human but can only use weapons found on the map the werewolf though must find moon light to transform into their were wolf form. once transformed they cannot use any  weapons minus their teeth and claws in their wolf state they are stronger and faster can climb up walls  and can detect or smell other players including ghosts. They are more vulnerable to ghost possession yet more resistant to vampire mind control. Can not touch silver weapons if struck with one instant death\n\nVampire: they have the ability to glide super strength minor form of detection transform into a bat as well paralyze a target. However the vampire must feed or it’s meter goes down when it does vampire must sleep to regain. Vampires can only use vampire weapons (mainly medieval style weapons) the vampire is vulnerable to holy weapons as well stakes and garlic bombs. Sunlight is especially dangerous causing them to burst into flames.\n\nGhost: ghosts are unique in the sense they start the game like wraiths where they can see players,move around, pass thru walls and float high but in order to kill players the ghost must possess one of the statues or armies laying around the stage. Ghost can also possess other players except for the werewolf. Once it’s possessed body is destroyed so to is the ghost. In ghost form it only be hurt with anti ghost weapons such as vampire swords.\n\nStages are destructive with day and night cycles   With so e stages providing a distinct advantage for certain classes for example in one stage the moon is full and large allowing instant transformation for werewolf’s. In another the  stage is filled with dozens of statues giving a ghost a variety to chose from."
gmjro8,Interesting/unique idea? Interactive maze/mystery game.,"I have an idea for a first-person, 3D game where you are trapped in a giant, pitch black, confusing labyrinth/maze, with nothing but a smartphone, that isn’t yours, with a dwindling battery the more you use it. It has what you would realistically and normally have on a smartphone; a clock, flashlight, camera, etc., though, the battery runs out quicker than what is typical just for the sake of this being a video game. Depending on which feature/app you use, the battery will deplete quicker, just like how a normal phone works. Now, the obvious thing to do that comes to mind is just pull out the flashlight on it and traverse your way through everything, trying to find an escape, or if you find that that is killing your battery too fast, try just using the light off of the screen itself, though it may not be as bright, But nevertheless, what you think the appropriate thing to do would be to use light to see your surroundings in hopes of finding an exit. But, there are still a lot of apps/features left, a lot seemingly useless. Why would you use a stopwatch? Or play music? Change the ringtone? And you probably don’t. But, huh, there’s this random file that was sent two hours ago to this phone’s email account that you were able to log in to by finding the old password for it saved into the Passwords and Accounts tab in the phone’s settings you accidentally came across because you miss-clicked while trying to check Photos app. You should maybe check that out. It could help you find your way out of here. But be sure to not get too distracted and go back and check the photos because sure there’s over 2,000 saved onto it, but surely at least one must be somewhat important right? And maybe one or two vaguely familiar somehow? Oh no though, it just died. There goes your only source of light. You’ll never make it out of here without it.\n\nYou see what I’m getting at? On the surface it’s a game about escaping through a dark maze, but really, it’s so much deeper than that, where you are going to have to do extensive searching, code breaking, etc., all within the phone — the last place you’d think to search through when you’re already searching through something on a much larger scale, especially when the seemingly only use for it is a flashlight. At first, everything else seems to be there just as a joke, or to make it appear more realistic; a smartphone would have apps on it. And while, yeah, some certainly are just for goofs or realism, some have an actual importance into figuring out how to escape the maze and beat the game.\n\n\n\nThoughts/feedback?"

gmfj44,"A Modern ""The Movies"" (2005) is an Absolute No Brainer for any Company with Strategy Game Expertise, and Here's Why","**The What**\nThe Movies, released in 2005 by the now defunct Lionhead Games.  It allowed the user to create their own movies with an astonishingly customizable host of sets, scenes, costumes, and effects. The career mode took you through the 1920s up to the 2000s, allowing you to discover new movie making techniques along the way.\n\n**The Why**\n* The gaming industry has an increasingly insatiable hunger for never-ending customization, uploading and sharing; it started with user pictures from games (which is now a key feature in many modern games), but we're seeing it in new ways, like *Dreams*, *Animal Crossing*, and the wonderful ways *Cyberpunk 2077* has incorporated customization into their character creator.  *Fallout: New Vegas* , a game in which you choose your path, has become a cult classic.  Freedom is what the people want in their games.\n\n* In 2005, a French industrial designer named Alex Chan created a 13 minute movie using *The Movies* creator, titled,*The French Democracy*.  It took him four days, and conveyed his view on riots and civil unrest at that time in France.  It received widespread, unprecedented attention from entities such as *Businessweek*, *The Washington Post*, and Peter Molyneux himself.  In the age of social media, an updated, polished, expanded game that allowed users to do this would produce masterpieces, and I'm not exaggerating.  *The Movies* was made in 2005, the possibilities after fifteen years of innovation are truly endless.\n\n* It makes business sense. The management sect of gaming is alive and well.  From a studio like *Paradox* , the game would sell.  On top of this, the DLC options are endless.  Look at *Planet Coaster* and their *Back to the Future* DLC.  In theory, a company could make DLC for as many movies as they wanted, granted they get the rights. \n\n* Last, but not least: if it's moddable, it is OVER. If a feature was implemented that allowed users to create and share their own custom made scenes, costumes, or effects, a single person could make a film that rivals a 1970s cartoon Disney Movies. With the creativity and dedication of the modding community, ANYTHING would be possible.\n\nI genuinely think giving people an engine to express their creativity like this would be revolutionary.  You see it on the front page of Reddit from time to time; a dedicated coder making their own game that looks great.  Imagine this, but with short films.  The game released in 2005 was already more customizable than it had any right to be; after fifteen years, the right studio could monopolize this market. Hope someone sees this, love the original and wanted to get my ideas out there! Any critiques are welcomed!"
gmfdgf,A survival horror game where the A.I is actually smart,"Yes I know you probably read the title and thought of 'Hello Neighbour' but my idea works slightly differently. Imagine a basic horror survival game like Amnesia or Granny but instead of hiding in a closet and waiting for the big bad monster to go away, what if instead the monster actually investigated the closet?\n\nIt would work something like this:\n\nDid the monster hear a noise? --&gt; if yes the monster should investigate the room and then proceed to investigate obvious places e.g. closets.\n\nDid the monster hear a noise? --&gt; if no the monster should not proceed to investigate obvious places\n\nIs the monster in the same room? --&gt; if yes the monster should not proceed to investigate obvious places unless it has a reason to e.g. it hears a noise.\n\nAnyway, I just want to ask people how to balance the gameplay e.g. will there be multiple hiding places? Will the monster have a hiding place that it investigates the most? If the monster hears a noise from somewhere else should it stop investigating?"
gmetlo,"A simple, browser-based game where you slowly grow a galactic civilization","Growing up, I got into playing [OGame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OGame) for a time and really enjoyed the simplistic aspect of it. You could login for a few minutes per day, make some decisions, and log off. Of course, today it's all monetized and ""Pay to Win"", but that's not really what this is about for me. It's about having a reasonable yet exciting project to practice my back-end web development skills. Graphics would be very limited, there would be no need for advanced mechanics, animations, etc. I know this forum is mostly geared toward live-action type games, but I figured I'd throw out some of my ideas anyway.\n\nFirst and foremost though, this is in no way an attempt to be completely original. In my brainstorming (and programming), I've already been trying to shy away from familiar constructs, but it will inevitably share a fair amount of them. It's my hope and intent that in time, I'll create something somewhat unique while sharing common gameplay characteristics. So with that out of the way, here's some basic ideas:\n\n**General Gameplay**\n\nYou begin with a single planet, upon which you can spend resources to construct better buildings such as mines, research laboratories, shipyards, etc. For probably the first several days/weeks of play, you will be upgrading these ""low tier"" buildings to improve your resource production. Later on however, you can research and amass resources to build more complicated structures (e.g. a space elevator, an orbital shipyard, fusion reactors, etc). At some point, you will be able to improve propulsion technologies to a point where colonization of other planets becomes feasible.\n\nSo basically, the game is about optimizing resource gathering, exploration, and growing your interstellar civilization. The graphics would amount to having some pretty art here and there to make things feel more real, but mostly the game will require a hefty amount of self-generated immersion. The game would be more like reading a book than watching a movie, to make an analogy. Additionally, players would be able to interact with each other in limited ways, be it espionage or trading or engaging in wars. Although to be honest, I am a bit worried about introducing combat, because it would be very difficult to balance new players with ones who have been playing for awhile.\n\n**Other Ideas**\n\n* There would be a tech tree, but it would be discovered, not observed in advance. I'd want players to be curious about what they can research and build next, be it dyson swarms, black hole engines, or basically any far-fetched science-fiction technology. I want them all.\n\n* There *could* be somewhat of a ""world map"" or way to locate oneself in physical space. I mostly want the game to stay simple and just be about upgrading technology, building ships/buildings, etc, but it could be cool to have a physically-traversible space to explore as opposed to just a button that says ""Explore Space"".\n\nI've been toying around with this idea in my head for just a week or so, but this is where I'm at so far. I've got a basic webserver setup though (running locally) that I've been adding to on a daily basis. This is a screenshot of the Overview page, where each of your planets will be displayed along with some stats. Below the main image (where the placeholder text is) is where I'll be putting things like current construction and research tasks, and how long they'll be until completion:\n\n[Image](https://imgur.com/a/sXW92MC)\n\nThe graphical interface is extremely rudimentary at this point, but I think you'll get what I'm going for.\n\nI'm open to any suggestions. At this point it's really just an idea with a simple skeleton of the actual product attached as a proof-of-concept. Like I said, I'm just working on this to learn back-end web development. If you're curious, I'm writing it with Python and using Django."
gme3p6,A welding and fabricating experience,"Ever since I have learned to weld and work with metal, I have been wanting to pursue the field, but tools costing upwards of thousands of dollars puts me off a little.\n\nBut with a good enough engine, I'm sure someone can make a realistic VR welding simulation to make crazy constructions with cutters and welders for metal. Ranging from sizes, and importing potential models to work on as a sandbox creation.\n\nSimple guides could be added with, since you don't need to worry about hurting yourself with high voltage in VR, most safety information could be skipped in favor of a game many people could get behind and build intricate armor and a big metal shack alike.\n\nThe normal human can get satisfaction of creation, and allowing a freedom to make and import models into the game can inspire endless creativity."
gmdjcw,A game that revolves around the stock market.,"Story:\n\nAfter figuring out a few falsidical stock market deals for the government, they hired you for a full time job. You have to figure out false stock market deals and ""delete"" them before it causes the market to go out of control. You sit down at home, waiting for the package the government said you'd get to arrive. (knock knock knock!) You open the door, and the package is there. You open it and find a tablet. You boot it up and there's only one app: Stocks. You open it and are presented with an interface. One half is filled to the brim with today's Stock Market deals, the other half has some buttons, one of which says ""Delete"". a robot thing pops up. ""Hi! My name is SHAI! Stock Helper Artificial Intelligence! I'm a learning AI that's been programmed to help you with figuring out false deals! Do you wanna learn the different functions, or do you wanna learn yourself?"" two buttons pop up: Yes and No. If you press No, then you just skip the tutorial. Of course, to avoid confusion, pressing No will say: ""Are you sure you want to skip the tutorial?"" just to make sure you know what the options mean. If you press Yes, it'll say: ""Do you want to enter the tutorial?"" So you don't press it before pressing No, or something. After the tutorial, SHAI leaves and you are left to figure out false deals by looking at past deals, the deal itself, finding things out of place, things like that. The point of the game is to take down a secret corporation that makes profit through false stock deals. Occasionally, you'll get a virus from this corporation, and you'll play a minigame that's essentially a top-down 32-bit boss fight. If you win, the virus is gone. If you lose, it'll mess up random things on the tablet, such as the order of the deals as an example for minor things, and straight up powering down your tablet for bigger things. In-game, you can turn off and plug in the tablet, just so the in-game clock has a use. After all, it's a tablet. It has battery. These mini-games are training for the real boss battles, the first of which has you get pelted with a bunch of viruses you have to take down before...you get an email? It's the I Love You virus, that's what the email is! At least, a modded version. You are forced to open the email, and you engage in fighting the virus. The other real boss battles are fighting other modded versions of major viruses, before eventually tracing one of the fake stock deals to the corporation, allowing you to find where it is. And so, the game changes from taking down false stock market deals to using the same functions to take down the corporation. How? Simple. Using the same functions on important files. Of course, during this chapter of the game (it's split into chapters), you'll mainly using the delete function on specific files. You have to use the deduction skills you've learnt in the previous chapters in order to find the correct files to delete, before taking on a virus developed by the corporation. It straight up becomes Link To The Past Ganon (well, it's in a similar vein) for the fight, before deleting the most important part of any computer or tablet or literally anything: Storage. How? Simple. Creating your own virus to take up all of the storage space on their tech. Of course, that doesn't mean they're gone yet. It just means that it'll take a long while before they can recreate their plan and actually have the space needed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, that's the story. Do any of you want me to continue, such as detail other stuff such as the other chapters? I dunno, it's your decision."
heoi86,"""Kirby: Time Travel Rescue"" An original Kirby game idea.","Alright. Let's get straight to the point:\n\nI had an idea for about six months AT LEAST for a Kirby game where you travel through PAST GAMES to retrieve parts of what basically keeps Planet Pop-star stabilized. Here's where it gets interesting:\n\n1. We take FIVE Kirby games from the past. (1 part of planet stabilizer for each point)\n2. We don't just stop at LEVELS. We go for bigger: ""Stages"", then ""Levels"", and finally ""WORLDS"" (Each past game is a world of it's own)!\n3. You have the ability to choose which shard you wanna go after. (An area where you actually walk on the planet like you would in ""Xeno Blade Chronicles"".) After you collect the part of the ""planet stabilizer"", the portal leading to that game from the past becomes a BOSS RUSH PORTAL FOR THAT GAME, and that fifth of the planet goes back to being yellow instead of grey. (Probably should've mentioned that earlier, but oh well.)\n4. Maybe there could be a secret mechanic where you can travel to OTHER GAMES (By that I mean games like ""Sonic"", ""Undertale"", ""Mario"", ""Legend of Zelda"" etc).\n5. OBVIOUSLY We are gonna need some mini-games. (I mean come on. What's a Kirby game without mini-games?) I was thinking of these as well, and I thought ""Let's take a mini-games from each of the five other games.""\n6. Because this is a game that has different times in it, we could have a mechanic where some levels we have to not get caught/seen from the Kirby of THAT GAME. (If you get caught, you lose the game and have 10% of your progress erased. \[I know that sounds harsh. To be fair though, I think that if we made contact with our past selves, we would either be erased from the pages of history, or we just destroy that one timeline.\])\n7. There most likely could be a shop where you can buy items to make ""Stages"" where you need to hide easier. Example: Invisibility potion. Makes you invisible, but not untouchable. Or maybe an item that gives you hints on how to complete that level in case you get stuck.\n8. I would add this, but I don't know how this would work: I was thinking maybe we can get a ""Multiplayer Campaign"", ""Multiplayer Boss Rush"", or ""Multiplayer Versus"". ""Multiplayer Versus"" would just be the mini-games.\n9. \*Single Player Campaign Only\* Maybe there could be a little bar under your Health Bar, and once it's full you can do some sort of combo with either Meta Knight, King Dedede, or Bandanna Dee... unless you're at the final boss Which makes it a team combo with ALL THREE.\n\nSide note/edited: We're probably gonna need a device with a HUGE amount of storage.\n\nThat's all that I can think of at the moment. Tell me what could be added, tweaked, or removed. And don't forget to tell me what you guys think."
hemffp,The Last Witness,"TL;DR: Post-apocalyptic exploration focused game where you traverse the ruins of society, collecting mementos, journals and other bits of text/computer files to bring to a secure enclave on the other side of the country.\n\nLong version:\n\nAfter playing a lot of Fallout and The Last of Us, plus the kerfuffle around TLoU2, I got to thinking about a different post-apocalypse experience. Something that retains some of the general bleakness of the genre, but where everyone isn’t a total monster. \n\nYou start on the East Coast in a small town (functionally in the US, but it doesn’t have to take place in the real world and can use fictional cities and towns) where you get to customize your character’s appearance and are introduced to the basic premise of solving environmental puzzles to collect hidden loot in the form of documents and supplies, as well as other knick -knacks.\n\nYou assume the role of The Scribe/Traveller/etc., a roving historian/archaeologist tasked with recovering documentation detailing humanity’s last days in the hope that some future civilization will find them and know what happened.\n\nThere are no human enemies, only environmental hazards and wild animals. Instead of a giant open world, the game takes place over a dozen discrete, but large levels as you make your way through the area. You can beeline the exit if you want, but you’ll miss out on the story elements that are the core focus of the game.\n\nThe game plays like the non-combat portions of Fallout or TLoU, where you’re digging up supplies and reading through books and scrawled messages. You have a variety of tools to document your findings, like a portable data storage device for computers (flash drives, whatever) or a camera for taking snapshots of objects/locations of interest in the wasteland. Inventory management is also a major component, as everything you pick up takes up space and has weight to it. And given that the goal is to bring back as much of the otherwise useless documents, you find yourself having to choose between taking another personal journal or a bottle of water that might save your neck later.\n\nThe more time you spend scavenging, the more cool stuff you can find, but the more supplies you’ll need to keep going. Plus, you need a certain amount of food and water to make it to the next level without suffering any penalties. Maybe throw in some light RPG skill trees to enable you to pick locks better or need less water to survive.\n\nThis is meant to be a quiet game like Journey, where the goal is to explore and see the sights rather than sneaking around or engaging in fistfights."
hefeek,Extra Difficult Dark Souls Clone,"I am interested in developing this game one day. Will probably be years before i begin working on this, still i really, REALLY, REALLY like this idea.\n\nGame Idea: A gothic medieval horror game like Dark Souls on ultra hard mode. Nothing will be spelled out or explained to players. Cryptic messages and clues will be the only guidance players get on how spells and magic items are used. There's a twist to the story and gameplay though. Very early on in the game the player is betrayed and cursed with a demonic spell. The spell randomizes a Curse penalty every 10 to 30 minutes of real time gameplay (it will randomly trigger). The penalties range from light player penalties to severe player penalties (with only light penalties occurring at the start of the game)\n\nThe random penalties are status effects and gameplay changes that are in play until a new curse triggers again. It might affect carry weight of the player (allowing them to carry five items only), or affect health (1/3 amount of health), or permadeath (deletes the current save file if the player dies), or slows player movement down, makes enemies do extra damage, slowly poisons the player, makes the player lose all gold coins, etc... Some of the severe penalties will affect gameplay in real time;  the Gargoyle Curse will freeze day time players in stone or the Frog Curse will turn the player into a defenseless 1 HP frog until the next curse triggers. The Confusion Curse makes the player unable to interact with NPCs or understand any text (it will appear scrambled), Mirror Curse will reverse controls of the player, etc. The player will be given a warning that a new curse will be appearing and then the curse would trigger. The player would get a unique icon showing their current curse, but no curse name would be given and only a vague description will show up.\n\nAll of the curses will be negative but might affect the player in a positive way. The Greed curse turns any item the player picks up or has in their inventory into gold coins immediately - making the player have no items available to use but a lot of gold coins leftover when the curse is done (during this curse the player can't buy items from NPCs - because it would create a money loop exploit).\n\nAnother mechanic of the game is the difficulty setting. The difficulty setting of the game will be based on when the player plays the game - this allows players some control on how difficult the game will be. The game would constantly keep track of the player's real world time and adjust the difficulty accordingly. For example a person starts playing the game at 8 pm at night - in game it will also be 8 pm at night and there will be more enemies around, stronger and more aggressive. Around 3 am, the enemies become demonic and disturbing, very hard to kill and more severe curses will affect the player. In contrast if a player starts playing at 10 am in the morning - in game it will also be 10 am, there will be fewer enemies, the curses will be lightweight, there will be plenty of NPCs and potion/health drops from enemies given.\n\nAnyways, just a weird twist to the Dark Souls genre - i think it could be possible to do but it would be difficult coding all the randomization of curses and world objects. Also with so many global changes in the game it would probably result in really bad bugs and glitches."
hefb4w,A zombie game where you can control Zombies,"Already working on this idea, need some feedback, and possibly ways to improve this. \n\nThe player can control a limited amount of zombies from the horde (how? Because science or some shit). At first the player can control basic mindless drones, give them orders and basically use them like puppets.\n\nZombies in your command can grow stronger by eating other zombies (or humans). Zombie diets can add new perks and abilities, based on who they eat. \n\nThe player can then evolve their power to control new types of zombies (like armored zombies or zombies that shoot acid). \n\nPlayers can gain new skills by raising their level and can even transfer passive skills to their zombie puppets.\n\nOh, and your zombies have permadeath. Which means if your zombie dies, they're gone for good. You have to find another one. But don't wore, you get to keep all your skills and commands learned.\n\nWhat if your puppets could become more....sentient?"
hef2so,Health loss affects player movement?,"How about this: The lower your health gets, the worse you character performs. You'd move slower, your camera would sway, the color would look grainy, maybe aiming stability would be lowered. The lower it gets the harder it is to move your character, until you're under like 10 hp then you'd be basically in a ""knocked"" state like in a battle royale, or at least be forced into a crawl. Maybe for the last few heath points you couldn't move at all, and be forced to heal or watch your character die.\n\nCombined with a bleed-out mechanic (taking damage will remove heath ticks slowly until the wounds see medical attention) I think this would fit in an FPS tactical/survival game."

hec6gr,"An RPG where you start off with a ton of fancy gear, but you have to strategically sell it piece by piece to afford the next level.","The game takes place in a tower with multiple levels, and each level costs one piece of gear to move forward. The game also lets you exchange gear at certain checkpoints. Every enemy can be beaten with zero gear, but doing so requires a great amount of skill. The skill is built up from finding ways to survive without the gear."
hea033,Game idea request for a split-screen multiplayer FPS with physics,"I've created a simple split-screen multiplayer FPS with physics (small demo vid here: [https://youtu.be/Ega4PZugBy0](https://youtu.be/Ega4PZugBy0) ).  It has weapons (rockets and grenades) which affect the physics, and players can push/shoot walls, but I'm struggling to think of a good game to wrap around it that's not just the usual shoot-other-players.  My original intention was to create something with the manic-ness of Gangbeasts, or an FPS retake of Super Smash Bros.  Any ideas would be very welcome."
he9inw,Enchanting English country estate restoration,"# Core concept\n\nYou have found a neglected country estate (a Hall/Mansion with gardens and grounds) at the edge of a rural English village and you're going to renovate it. You start off living in the entrance hall, sleeping on a camp bed with a lamp and a cooking stove, and you spend your days cleaning and repairing and restoring everything to its former glory. You start off with little access to anything, and as you start restoring each room, you get benefits for doing so to keep you engaged. By the end, you have a fully beautifully restored mansion with grounds and gardens, and local village people employed as staff, making best use of the house and grounds.  \n\n\n# Main theme\n\nThe main theme is that of improvement and bringing prosperity. Whether this is restoring an individual room, or clearing out the weeds from the rosebed to allow the roses to grow again, or by employing the locals to raise the village prosperity. Every action should have a noticeable, permanent, positive impact. The game has a very positive feel of uplifting everyone and everything through your work and accomplishments, of taking something of little value and making it into something beautiful and useful.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Mechanics\n\nYou would only have a certain amount of stamina per day, but it should be a generous amount, and there should be ways to replenish it, for example cooking food or taking a hot bath - and the progression is such that you'd need to have found and repaired the boiler and pipework and discovered the bathroom before you can do this; you unlock abilities to help out the work as you progress further. You can do cleaning and dusting from the outset, but you would require a workbench and tools for things like chopping wood to make repairs. You can unlock better tools that require less stamina and can make higher quality works as you progress. As your tools improve, so does your ability to renovate. Maybe particular renovations restore part of your stamina - for example you feel happier in a room as you wash the window panes and let all the light in, giving you an instant stamina boost as you feel newly invigorated and spurred on to do the next part of the room. Maybe it's not ""stamina"", maybe it's more ""energy/happiness"", where you get boosts for making progress because letting the light in or getting the water pipes cleared out so that water now flows to the sink gives you a real encouragement and makes you feel uplifted and like you've done a small thing to make what could end up being a big difference.\n\nYou would tend to work on one or two rooms at a time so as not to overwhelm the player. There can be different stages of ""done"" per room, for example when you first gain access you can clean the windows to let the light in (so you don't need to use your lamp), you can do dusting and cleaning, repairing objects such as a bed or wardrobe or curio, and then eventually as part of the endgame you can decorate the room with curtains and carpets and chandeliers. The stages would tend to be ""cleaning"", ""repairing"", ""decorating"". You would just need to get the room to a certain basic point before you can either start using it or it unlocks the next room. ""Using a room"" means, if it's a bedroom then you can clean it and repair the bed, and now you can use that as your bedroom, which gives you a better night's sleep and thus more stamina for the next day. Or, restoring the kitchen gives you access to the stove so that you can cook meals (hot food restores more stamina), and then in the future you can add a refrigerator to store foods and ingredients of better quality. There should always be the availability of doing something in the house and doing something in the outside space, so that if you're feeling like you've been stuck indoors for a while, you can go outside into the fresh air and do some tidying/exploring out there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Progression\n\nProgression would be physically limited, for example you can't get to the bathroom through the bedroom until you've restored enough of the bedroom and maybe removed all the junk that is blocking the bathroom door. There should always be a couple of rooms available for you so that you have choice. You can't get upstairs until you have repaired the grand central staircase, and that doesn't give you access to all the areas upstairs, just the first few until you've cleared stuff out. There should also be some unusual methods of progression, such as restoring an outside wall trellis giving you access to the room at the top through the window, or unclogging and exploring the well gives you access to a secret passage to a hidden grotto.\n\nThere are many secret passages and rooms that tie in with the mystery part of the story (if you include one - see ""Optional ideas"" section later), which also serve as shortcuts. For example, if you've cleared out the central staircase to go up, then a few rooms to the left, uncovered a hidden staircase that leads down to the kitchen, this unlocks a shortcut from the kitchen back to this room, but you can only find the shortcuts at the furthest endpoint so that it routes it back to a point near to where you start so that you don't need to go through all those rooms when you start again the next morning. The mansion is unconventional in layout and has many hidden backstairs, cellars and rooms. There can be clues that there are other rooms, for example having 8 sets of upstairs windows on the front but only 7 doors off the hallway.\n\nTo start with, you have limited access outside in the grounds - there may be an overgrown vegetable plot that you can clear and start farming on, and woods where you can go and explore and cut wood and maybe go fishing. All of these provide resources, with the quality and type of resources getting better the further in you play. Exploring might reveal an ice-house, which gives you access to storage or better quality food, and cutting down an overgrown plant might reveal a gate through to another garden.\n\nYou can visit the village nearby to meet the townsfolk. They can sell resources and help with work. You do quests to help them out to unlock them, and use their skills. For example, if you've restored the kitchen and helped out the old lady who loves to bake, she can come work in your kitchen making cakes which sell in the village, and you both get a cut of the profits, which you can use to buy resources or hire someone to help out with dusting or repairs, or to help clear the garden.   The gatehouse could be turned into a farm shop that sells fresh veggies and flowers from the garden for an income.   You could end up having a number of the townsfolk working on the estate (gamekeeper, cook, woodworker, maid) which all act as automating some of the work. There's no ""employee management'' part of the game - you're not deciding who to hire and fire and measuring productivity. No-one likes doing this in real life. Just assume that the villagers are all happy and willing to work, and are good at what they do, and each one is an expert in something. Maybe after you've repaired the doorbell, they each come calling to introduce themselves and help out for the day as a follower, and as you get to know them you find out what it is they enjoy doing and what skill they're good at, giving you a direction as to which room to restore next (for example, the kitchen or the woodshed to unlock meals and a supply of logs). Maybe some of them used to work on the estate, or their ancestors did, and they have cosy tales and tidbits which can unlock hidden areas (""my grandma was a maid and would always use the backstairs to bring hot water from the kitchen direct to the Lady's bathroom when drawing a bath"", ""my grandpa said there was a passage in the well which led out to the churchyard""). Quests to help the townsfolk could include tidying up the grandma's wildly overgrown garden that she's no longer able to maintain and it was making her sad, repairing the blacksmith's leaky roof, fixing an old piece of machinery; each one should be doing something to improve their life, and the skill level/type of resources required could be higher for some people so that you can only unlock them at a later stage.\n\nIt should require work but shouldn't be grindy. I find ""grind"" a lazy mechanic, where someone couldn't think of something more creative so instead just made it so that you have to cut down 100 trees over the course of a week just to make a fence post. ""Stamina"" and availability of resources is what limits your daily work, but there should be ways of increasing these, such as ways to replenish your stamina or ways to make money so you can either buy chopped wood or employ someone to do it and they can do a set amount each day. The important thing is: these are optional. If you want to pay someone to chop wood you can, but you don't have to, there's alternative ways available. You should also be able to play for short amounts of time and achieve something - not a 3 hour grind to get all the wood to repair a bed, but a half hour where you can pick up the controller, do a bit of work, achieve something small and then go get on with something in real life if you don't have the time to sit and play for longer. No-one likes a game where you spend a half of your real-world day chopping 100 wood for the staircase only to get around the next corner and find exactly the same again. There should not be anything that significantly blocks your progress or is unnecessarily frustrating; it should be small amounts and achievable. Save the things that would require more resources for later on, when the player has better tools and help from other people to make a bit more light work of it. Maybe you can clear a workspace when you first enter a room to store all the materials, and you can add to this stockpile, so if you needed 50 wood to repair an elegant 4-poster bed, you could go chop 20 wood today and add it to the pile, and it shows you that you have 20/50 in there, so that you can work towards a significant thing even if you don't have too much time available to play today, and you can see that you've made progress. It should still take time to do the work - you won't get a sense of achievement if you rattle through completing 10 rooms fully in half an hour - so you need to find the balance between how much effort is required (in terms of doing the work and gathering the resources) versus making the player felt like they've achieved a thing today, even if it's small, or even if it's only for part of a room.  \nYour tools can be upgraded over time, and the locations to get resources. For example, you start out getting water to wash the windows from the pump near the back door, and you have to go here each time to fetch water, but then once you start getting the pipework working inside the house, you can start using nearby sinks instead. You have to go to a clearing in the woods to chop wood, but can store this in the woodshed near the house once you've restored it, and it takes less effort to chop wood once you've upgraded your tools - this also gives something extra to work towards.  \nGraveyard Keeper gameplay I felt was too busy - you always tried to get too much done in one day, and there were certain days when certain things would happen (for example, a particular merchant is only available on a Tuesday) and since he had a quest associated with him, and you had to get a certain amount of resources ready for him to trade to get the thing you want, that sometimes you felt compelled to do a certain thing on a particular day, rather than waking up and deciding for yourself what you wanted to do that day. There should be a good deal of choice in the game and it shouldn't matter if you neglect to water the plants every single day; some days you just need to go spend the day exploring in the woods, and there shouldn't be negative consequences for doing so.   \nThere's lots of scope for exploration. In the woods you can find a summerhouse, winter garden, ice house, greenhouses, orangery, woodshed, lakehouse, a waterfall grotto, a lake with a spillway. Maybe there's a hedge maze. You can turn the conservatory into a tea room and sell tea and fresh warm cakes, having turned it from a dirty, dark, cold space with broken windows and birds' nests into a beautifully warm, light, fresh place full of laughter and enjoyment.\n\nThere should be celebrations and festivals when you fully restore certain parts where you invite the locals to see what's been achieved: a tea party when the conservatory is cleaned up and the kitchen is working; a treasure hunt in the woods when the woodland trails are cut back, a swimming party when the lake filtration system has been fixed. These can be regular things which can reoccur at your choosing after you've unlocked them instead of just being a one-off; maybe you sent out invites or put up a notice on the front gate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Scope for expansion\n\nThe game could be expanded through DLC or mods, for example giving a Victorian walled vegetable garden, or access to the quarry/mine/forest on the rest of the estate, a Japanese Water Garden or an old waterway system that needs unclogging around the estate which eventually feeds the ornamental fountain at the front after filling all the man-made forest pools along the way. Allowing people to create their own mods can add extra people and rooms, resources and decorations to the game, and make it much more replayable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# End-game\n\nThe game in its end-state is a fully-restored and decorated mansion, with grounds, and local staff maintaining it, which makes its own income from selling produce made on the estate, tours of the grounds, a tea room and maybe the stable block has been converted into holiday lets. The village improves due to the in-flow of money, with each individual house being upgraded over time as you employ the homeowner on the estate, with the villagers enjoying more prosperity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Real-world inspiration\n\nIf you get the chance to visit some country estates in England, do so because the atmosphere there isn't captured in any photographs. They are very tranquil, and there is a real sense of peacefulness, even if you visit when there's lots of tourists there, they're always fun days with lots to do. Looking around the houses gives you the sense of grandeur, but the real magic lies when you get outside into the estate; the formal gardens are arranged, well-kept and always have stories around the flowers and herbs that grow there, then you go on a woodland walk and discover bluebells and birdsong and wild garlic and streams off the beaten track in the centuries-old deciduous woodland. There is a real sense of child-like wonder and you have the excitement of exploration in a safe place. There should be birdsong, the sound of trickling water, butterflies, sunbeams through the trees, wildflower meadows, streams with hidden waterfalls and fireflies at night - so that it feels secluded and enchanting.\n\nSome good examples are: Rufford Abbey,   Hestercombe, Newstead Abbey, Clumber Park, Somerleyton. If you're Googling for images, don't just search for ""Rufford Abbey"" because this will only give you the building, also search for ""Rufford Abbey grounds"", gardens, landscaping, and estate maps (the maps published at the sites show you everything that's in the estate, all the buildings and the woodland walks) because the grounds are a fundamental part of the estate. Aesthetic of the game should be English Country Estate, with a nearby rural village.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Aesthetic &amp; Similar Games\n\nI picture this more as a pixel art type than a first person 3d, because for me it means you can see more of a room; you have a defined space that you can see that you are working on which is both achievable and has limited scope, so you can see exactly how much needs doing at any given point. I love the old-style JRPG look, like in Ara Fell; but also see Rakuen for a beautiful style that looks much less made-from-tiles, and Foxtail for hand-drawn and stunning. Cutesy is good.\n\nThink Graveyard Keeper (for the repair and restoration, not the dead bodies). I imagine the graphics to be pixel art-y and cute, but not basic. I find the aesthetic of Stardew Valley/Serin Fate to be too vivid (I prefer more muted/realistic colours), Graveyard Keeper is too defined, Kynseed is too visually busy, Little Witch in the Woods is perfect.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Optional ideas\n\n(I've drafted this post out before posting to reddit, and as I've adapted my ideas, the mystery thing seems less important and might be distracting away from the core gameplay - that of restoring an estate and bringing prosperity to the area, rather than solving a superfluous mystery. Mysteries can really bring a game down if they're not done well, and I think this game already has a core enough purpose without tacking on an extra thing. But I'll include it here in case it piques your interest)  \n\n\nThe mansion also has a past, which you can uncover as part of an ongoing mystery. Maybe the family disappeared in mysterious circumstances, or they became inexplicably rich overnight, or there is stonework that includes mysterious medieval clues, or it belonged to a reclusive inventor who left mysterious devices around the house which can help you along your journey. Clues would be everywhere and you could have a scrapbook to catalogue them, such as diary pages, headstone   inscriptions in the churchyard, footnotes written in books in the library or the nursery. The mystery does not have to be spooky or dark.  \n\n\nPlay as animals! Because who doesn't like playing as a fox or a hedgehog or a field mouse. See Foxtail for cuteness inspiration. Maybe your main character has a natural ability, such as seeing better in the dark or digging, which makes aspects of the game easier.\n\nSeasons. Not that you would have to get certain things done for certain dates, but more so that you can experience the woods in the autumnal colours and a snowy winter wonderland rather than just a luscious spring or endless summer. This could also allow seasonal flowers and food, and seasonal celebrations such as a harvest festival in autumn, and a light festival one night in winter. I would probably base these on the Celtic festivals of the Wheel Of The Year, because these are close to nature and the cycle of the seasons.\n\nMagic. Maybe there's natural magic in the world, or you can use the power of nature if you leave a small offering and a prayer at different shrines you find out in the woods. Stronger water magic for today might mean it takes less effort to unblock the pipes or the waterways, or you use less of it when cleaning.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Final notes\n\nI realise this is detailed. This is purposeful so you can see the same thing as I'm seeing in my head. Feel free to adapt and add your own ideas. Hope you've found this enjoyable or interesting to read."
he8i8r,Guildmaster: it could be good,A game called like guildmaster or something and you are put in a beginner town where you join a guild and you take missions/journeys/quests to build levels and rank and when you get high enough leveled you can make your own guilds and have real people join it. This game would be a online hub for people. It would be separated into regions and you can play with friends. The art style would be not to serious kinda like jump force.\n\n the idea for this came off of the manga/anime fairy tale so dont @ me.

hdwy95,"Please for the love of God, somebody recreate an actual good Train Simulation game","# TL;DR - A new Train Simulation game should have a very fluid and straight-forward route/scenario editor tool like in Trainz, exceptional/realistic gameplay like in Run8, with beautiful graphics like in TS2020/TSW, oh and don't forget the multiplayer too.\n\nSo if any developer who is experienced with making something and has a passion for railroads, please hear me out!\n\nSo here's my deal here. I've played Trainz, I've played Railworks TS2020, I've tried TrainSimWorld during the Steam's free weekend awhile back, I've watched full gameplays of people taking *full* advantages of other Train Simulation games such as Run8. But each and every one of them have their what I would consider *major* cons;\n\nFor **Railworks TS2020** (that I currently still actively play to this very day), it's the company **Dovetail Games** itself. They formed off of Electronic Arts awhile back, so already I'm not liking that fact alone. When they made this game a decade back before it got into Steam, it was actually really freaking good for its time. In the more recent years however they've been releasing buggy DLCs ***as is*** to this day, and they never bother to fix it letalone the fact abandon their older broken DLCs that they still also sell to this very day. I've learned to suck it up and deal with that, considering sound/physics mods will fix part of some DLCs most of the time. My big problem however with this engine is anything outside of the awesome gameplay itself. Sometimes tweaking things is a pain especially when there's a time I need to reinstall the game for any reason and everything goes back to default. Say I want to make a route/scenario for a route: The editor for this is ***atrociously ludicrous*** when you want to do anything, while it's *so* darn *simple* to replicate in a **Trainz** world editor itself. If you have a Train placed and set to go on a particular track, even if it doesn't directly interfere with your track and has totally different timetables, that's *still* enough for it to fail and not function completely. In **Trainz**, you place it down, tell it where you want it to go with several clicks, and that train is set to do exactly that. There's so much about the editor and the game itself that I can go on for days, but for a sake of this post criteria, I won't. I'm very well confident the reason they don't fix/improve this game anymore because they're trying their hardest to promote **TrainSimWorld**.\n\n**TrainSimWorld** also owned by **DTG**: Tried it, hate it. When they first released it, their first routes were pretty nice and paid pretty good attention to detail. At the time of the release they promised an editor and multiplayer. The game has been out since 2018, and they never delivered any of those. Nowadays their DLCs are just so bad, even some **TS2020** DLCs look/perform much nicer. Hell the 3rd party TS2020 content by **SearchlightSimulations** for example look/perform nicer than 90% of TSW's content. I am hearing promising things about TrainSimWorld **2**. But to say how TS2020 and TSW is done so far I'm really losing my hopes hence me turning to making this thread. I do not like the fact however that they're going to be both two separate applications. Meaning if I want to play legacy DLC from TSW2020 on TSW2, I have to buy TSW2020 first, then buy TSW2 to migrate all of that. The second installment should honestly be a free upgrade, so this also upsets me.\n\nI already briefly mentioned the pros with **Trainz**, so I'll only say what I don't like about Trainz. While the editor seems to be the only thing phenomenal about it, everything else just... isnt. The graphics is still pretty bad, even on **Trainz 2019**. The bad about the editor on Trainz is the lack of real world map overlays like TS2020 offers (other than importing ""screenshots"" of a small portion of the map you want to lay track on), so you're mostly stuck with making fictional routes. For gameplay, the performance is absolutely horrid. I'm not kidding. *It doesn't matter what specs you're running with*. When you move into freecam and try moving around, before it starts rendering really anything, the game completely freezes up, and has to be killed with task manager. **TS2020** almost doesn't have this problem; time to time it will have lag spikes and severe frame drops in very dense areas but recovers *fast*, and runs at full 60 FPS in suburban areas. Going back to **Trainz** however there's pretty much little-to-no recovery; you're stuck in your cab for the highest FPS you can grasp, and just pray your game doesn't crash everytime you have a 10-second long lag spike. I personally haven't played Trainz for years because of this.\n\nLastly I want to bring up mainly Run8. I honestly don't have really anything bad to say about this. I've personally never played this but I'm hoping to eventually try it out. This in terms of simulation exceeds my expectations in realism and physics. It offers realistic multiplayer with voice chat using channels, with people who actually take the sessions seriously to heart, and I think that's great. My only complaints are the MSTS-like graphics and their lack of new development. I would understand the ""gameplay-over-graphics"" concept. However after awhile of watching the gameplay: the lack of good sound quality, weather details, and some other smaller details will eventually make me bored of the game itself especially if I were to play single player. I want them to eventually release more new routes to cover (especially in the northeast region of the United States), but granted getting licensing permissions from various rails is an absolute pain. It still is worth an effort on their part because somehow DTG is releasing routes much faster than Run8 are.\n\n# NOW FOR THE SOLUTION AND IDEAS!\n\nFirst and foremost that every game has that I consider to be problematic especially if you're a collector: **local files**. This maybe a bit controversial, but me personally the installation folder becomes a horrific mess and has caused game crashes for me. I prefer a client-based online/offline application with everything stored within the application core folder itself rather than an installation folder. The engine would receive regular updates to either fix a bug, or release a new train in the cloud. This way you can open the application and time to time discover bug fixes/releases. In offline mode, you'll also get the same updates, but you'll need to be connected to the internet to download them.\n\nNow I can see one big problem with this idea: ""How will the developer make money with this method? Especially how will they put out new trains each update without directly charging the customer?"" I would suggest to support the development by charging a monthly fee to use the ***multiplayer service*** *itself*. The reasoning for this (other than giving the developer money to support the game further) is to prevent trolls/those not taking a multiplayer session seriously. If you look at Run8, they from my knowledge usually host private multiplayer sessions with trusted people that join and take the run seriously. You don't want a kid joining and taking a freight train 90 MPH down a mountain and causing a catastrophic disaster ruining the gameplay for others.\n\nNow what about the editor? The editor can be used for the following things:\n\n* Making custom fictional trains/routes that you can play offline mode to yourself only.\n* You can also use the gameplay map consisting real routes that exists in real life and help the community out by expanding it by adding missing details, or extending a route if there are missing trackage that exists in real life. Then you can submit it to the developers for review, and give you proper credit if it gets approved for a new update!\n   * Especially in cities since they're changing all the time in real life, you can update small areas like a new building, a 5-year long major construction, a new track speed limit (in my area, a branch used to be 25 MPH but downgraded to 10 MPH because it's not used as much as it used to be back in the 80s), etc, etc.\n   * The developer can (temporarily) blur or modify a particular object, decal, or text if it requires licensing permissions from the railroad/various companies to present that publicly in-game.\n* You can also submit repaints of locomotive/rolling stock paint schemes that exist in real life too, or real life train 3D models that aren't in the game, and the correct sounds as well.\n   * Again the developer can approve these but can (temporarily) blur/modify little details of your work due to licensing permissions from the railroad to use in-game.\n\nThe editor should contain **TOOLS THAT ARE SIMPLE AND STRAIGHTFORWARD TO USE!** I cannot stress enough how much work it is just to make a simple track work in TS2020. Making a junction to switch over to a different track requires a lot of precision or it won't come out right or at all. In Trainz however you can click on a track, a new piece of track follows your cursor, you click where you want it to stretch to, and you're all set. Joining the track is a same problem. You have to move your mouse until you find a connection point on the other track, and doesn't snap exactly where you want it to. Trainz you just click, snap, and modify a couple of spline points - that's it. Terrain tools are extremely easy with Trainz, and you can learn them in one sitting. With TS2020 they're very tough to master, especially when you want to create constant 1.8% grade increases/decreases. There are so many more things about the Trainz editor that makes it so much better than TS2020's, but I think I've given a general description what it feels like with the provided details.\n\nBasically I want an editor like Trainz with a world map overlay I can trace tracks over like in TS2020. It could use either ***Google Maps API*** or ***OpenStreetMap*** as a choice.\n\nThen lastly there's the gameplay. It should obviously have RailDriver and TrackIR support from the get-go. DTG promised they would have that support back in 2018 when they first unveiled TSW, but never happened. I would also suggest **not rushing on releasing the game** either and making the same mistake DTG did with TSW.\n\nThe gameplay physics should be like Run8, but the graphics/sounds should be like in TS2020.\n\nThis is all I have for now with suggestions. If anybody has any pros/cons I'd appreciate them. I'd love to hear out your suggestions for my idea, and what you would add or take away from my list of ideas."
hdt9qs,"Painkiller or Serious Sam - like game in open world, character leveling and with many NPC simulate non-stop fighting","Hi, I have an idea of fast action FPS game in open world with leveling system, the player has some hub or start city and the ""tower of evil"" with main boss on other side of the game map, there are non-stop fights between this two points and your task is increasing of skills and help your town's NPCs to fight with enemies' main hub and destroy it.

Their locations could be indicated by radius circles that get smaller as players discover clues / evidence.\n\nOther sorts of things could be added e.g. treasure maps, clues etc.\n\nTreasure located in difficult locations e.g. the sahara desert which could only be walked to provide more currency.\n\nPlayers must also feed / water their avatars and make sure they have enough fuel, food and water for their journies."
hdny4p,The Hatchet (Baltagul),"The story of the game is based on the famous police novel by Mihail Sadoveanu. The protagonist's husband, Nechifor Lipan, leaves for a sheep business. The protagonist, Vitoria Lipan, suspects that something happened to him, and embarks on a mythical and authentic Romanian adventure, through the villages. She finds him dead, and tries to discover the perpetrator. \n\nThe whole book / film is a work of art, with a Romanian essence, with surroundings from Romania, with plains, hills and a landscape with old and authentic Romanian houses. The game gives you a feeling of nostalgia, even if you are not from Romania.\n\nThe music of the game should be produced by artists from Romanian folklore, in order to reproduce some strong feelings. \n\nAn example would be the Subcarpati or the Osoianu Sisters (those who also participated in the creation of a cover of the song from The Last of Us Part II).\n\nFor more details about the game, you can read the book, it will leave you behind, or you can watch the movie, to see exactly the atmosphere in which everything takes place. \n\nBaltagul (The Hatchet) - police novel by Mihail Sadoveanu."
hdmz8v,A metroid and Doom crossover,"It can be a FPS shooter, where either samus or the doom slayer gets transported into one of the two worlds. Samus could be inside hell or Mr. You know who(why don't they give him a name) ends up in the metroid universe. One of the protagonists detects(?) the other entering their realm. The two meet. There's a clash, more stuff happens, there's a rivalry(blah, blah blah blah, you choose what happens during this session) but at the end (like all crossovers) the two said 'heroes' form a friendship and they all live happily ever after.........\n\n\nNah, I'm Just kidding. Both of them wreak havoc and see each other as enemies. Samus thinks Doom Guy is a corrupted bounty hunter(or something else, I'm not that familiar with metroid's lore) and doom guy thinks it's a demon. \n\nBut for this to work. There should be two campaigns. One where you play as doom guy and the other as Samus. Actually, come to think of it. There should be four. Since there's four outcomes. (I'm gonna shorten stuff just in case it gets long) for example, doom guy in metroid, play as samus, chase down doom guy or doom guy in metroid, play as DOOM GUY, find a way back to his own world. Another example, samus in doom, ..... on second thought, you know what's happening. I hope this message reaches the worthy."

hdfsz2,An RPG where you only gain passive skills,"The game starts like a standard final fantasy type quest. There is a demon, you are about to leave a starting town to travel the world to find the means to defeat him. You leave the town walls and... the demon king is right there anticipating your quest.\n\nSo you are stuck in the town. And it has a magical shield to keep the demon out, or whatever. What matters is, you can't travel. You can't fight monsters, you can't level up, you can't gain weapons or magic.\n\nYou can only explore your town. And in doing so, you find you can interact with almost everything. You are stuck at level 1, but by taking the right actions, you gain jobs and passive skills. These skills help advance each other.\n\nFor example, in the library, interacting with a bookshelves just makes you notice how many books there are. But if you have boosted your passive int by, say, talking to old people, you find you can pick out a book worth reading and learn about the town's history. Now you can find a trapdoor somewhere.\n\nThere is a cat. Pet it, and you start gaining Cat Fancier skills. Learn to fish, then give the cat a fish. The cat brings you a bell that does something useful.\n\nLearn every job in town, and explore how skills from one help you advance another.\n\nYou can fight the boss any time you feel like. He will always completely overwhelm you in power. But each round of combat, you can try some of the job skills you've gained, and at least one you could have will help you survive. Survive all the rounds because you have a broad enough skillset, and you win. Yay for you."

hd31mx,I really miss the concept of this game...,"[It's called Unlight and you can see a bit of the gameplay here.](https://youtu.be/b3nfYIztx20) It started out as a Facebook game but it got taken down a few years ago for unknown reasons. Then the developers made a mobile version of it, called SchizoChronicle, but that got taken down too. So basically it doesn't exist anymore. \n\nI apologize if this isn't appropriate for this sub but I haven't found any other sub I can post this to, since this is technically not a retro game or anything. But I do wish someone could make a game like this again. What do you all think of the game concept?"
hd0rha,open world RPG but smaller scale with Void Bastards graphics idea,"2d art style and first person perspective like  [https://store.steampowered.com/app/857980/Void\_Bastards/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/857980/Void_Bastards/) \n\ncharacter customisation i guess one could implement it and you just see a portrait of your character in the inventory/status menu. Not sure how one could effectively implement a third person mode with third person character model in this 2d style.\n\nThe world is open world but smaller scale with lots of depth, different hubs with a lot of buildings with lived in interiors and the npc's have immersive behaviours where they can be seen doing things. People on the street have somewhere to be like maybe their out shopping, their are going to work, they are going home and if you go inside you can see them working at work, relaxing at home.  Guards go on patrol, go on breaks, get relieved by other guard who enters the area when shift ends. Like not fallout type open world with vast empty environments but like a man kind divided type of open world. So no cars or roads, just a lot of foot paths and travelling between hubs is you walk to a train station and take the train or you if you are wanted by the law, you can pay various individuals for illegal passage.\n\nThe setting is a 1950s future, similar to Fallout but not post apocalyptic. The player is in a crappy city in a crappy country (fictional). The factions consist of various criminal gangs and the police who are controlled by the rich elite who run all the big operations. So there are various hubs some clearly lower income places controlled either by one of the various gangs or the police patrolled mostly by human guards where these factions clash. There are hubs where the rich stay (so hotels, casinos, clubs) which are patrolled by OP robot police mostly and some human police in exoskeleton armour so conflict isn't as open here. So given the setting there is no forensic system, law enforcement is just the guards of whatever faction controls that area gives an option of bribe (requires skill check, not available for robots), fine (really expensive, weapons and certain items confiscated), imprisoned (weapons and certain items confiscated, attribute and skill permanent decrease, lose job).\n\nThe ""story"" is you are an orphan you just turned 18 so they are cutting you loose. Character creation happens here so you determine your starting attributes and skills. There are various ways you can go about the game. You can go look for a normal job many are available like retail, factory/warehousing, courier, call centre, etc for many companies ran by the rich elite or you can go do certain activities to get the attention of one of the various gangs and work for them (""quests"" will vary from gang to gang) or you can sign up with the police with its own set of missions. Moving up in your faction if you joined one requires you to complete quests for them and meet skill checks/requirements. There are various end games. Get a working visa to move to better country (fictional) which has been made ridiculously high by the rich elite. Get high up from within one of the many gangs and help your gang gain power over the city. Get enough money to secure residence in one of the rich hubs and also secure employment in said hub via getting high up in whatever company you are with or doing enough police work to get transferred to one of the upper class hubs.\n\nThe RPG elements do it like fallout new vegas, you got attributes which affect skills. Certain activities get xp, you can level up and put points into your skills and then you get a perk point you can put into some perks which depend on your skills and attributes. Certain things can be done to increase attributes temporarily but they each have adverse affects. Like exercise to increase strength/endurance/agility for 3 days depending on what exercise but you are tired for a while so the attribute is actually damaged for a few hours before the bonus sets in. Studying does the same for intelligence. Drugs can be taken for immediate benefit but once it wears off temporary damage to attributes is acquired. Permanent addiction can be acquired and if so withdrawal will damage attributes. It may not make complete sense like you can level up by combat but then you level up intelligence skills like computer but at least one doesn't need to micro manage their levelling (like in morrowind/oblivion). Skill/ Attribute checks are not chance based, either you meet the required check or you don't.\n\nThe combat is melee and guns and explosives, melee you can block and attack, blocking/ getting blocked causes you to get staggered. The attributes and skills associated affect damage given and taken and stamina costs. Guns and explosives can be ballistic and energy based, attributes and skills affect damage and handling like weapon sway, recoil, aiming speed, reload speed. The stealth system is vision based and sound based (like dishonoured) how easy one is seen and heard is based on the stealth skill, the attributes associated and what the player is wearing. But it never gets absurd like max stealth skill and someone cant see you when you are right in front of them and just a few meters away in a well lit area (unless you have a suit/ device that make you invisible). If one is not caught or they are caught but witnesses are killed before they can report then the player doesn't get any bounty/wanted level or any reputation affected. For equipment just have helmet and body slot which covers the whole body Then there is weapon and shield slot, some weapons are 2 handed. If one is wearing a faction uniform they will get attacked by enemy factions.\n\nSo yes thats my idea, i'm an it student thinking of making my own indie game some day. what do you think could this possibly be a successful game (for an indie game). Or no too done already, not original enough?"

hd0fs3,Anime House M.D. with other-worldly illnesses,"I had this idea for a story-heavy, anime type game where you play as a doctor in a hospital, in a House M.D. type situation.\n\nWhat makes it interesting is that, in this world, sicknesses and medical conditions are stranger than anything you would experience in real life. For instance, instead of chickenpox, a normal childhood illness would be multi-pox; an illness that causes children to randomly duplicate.\n\nStarting at the lowest level in the hospital, you would come to the attention of the resident diagnostician who would put you on his team. The game would take place in long chapters, each focusing on a different patient. You spend the chapter trying to diagnose the patient's illness as they start to experience paranormal and extraordinary symptoms.\n\nAs you become more involved with the patient and start to learn more about them, you start to actually care about the patient, wanting to cure them before it's too late.\n\nI haven't come up with a game play idea for diagnostics, but I want to have a lot of medical tests and patient care made into mini-games.\n\nI'm thinking of having an open world hospital campus so you can develop relationships with other doctors and use their knowledge to help gain clues towards your diagnosis.\n\nDoes this sound like an interesting concept?"

hcwoha,My completely unique game concept. Thoughts and opinions?," Basically a bunch of chat rooms, but the twist is players create the content - they choose a location, ""road to x"" for an example, and they may add a tavern, a waterfall, etc. with a description, to that location, and it becomes a new chat room. If the location gets enough upvotes and visits per month, it stays in the game. Dev would be responsible for creating the skeleton of a world, (cliche medieval high fantasy setting maybe) and tempering some of the inevitable goofballs.\n\nYes, I did google and find some similar stuff, but none seem to really incorporate the player content into a consistent world.\n\nWould anyone play it? I think so, there's tooooons of plain text roleplaying games online with decent activity, but they all seem so niche. There's demand for a general purpose text rpg, and user created content would be a bonus."

hcr7ar,A Colony Survival Game (Apocalyptic),"This is not really original, but I like the idea anyway, so here goes:\n\nPregame plot: A terrorist threatens the world that if Billionaires of the world won't even the scales financially (so that there are no more people in poverty and no more famine), they will release a deadly virus that will kill a very high percentage of the human race. Only some people are immune to it, but its entirely random based on genetics.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGame Itself: A group of University students make their way to a boat with limited supplies, and find an island far enough away from society they can escape the initial infection. Before leaving they have a limited amount of time to collect enough supplies to survive and also collect enough different people who have skills important to the survival of the colony. Making the wrong decision as early as boating to the island can end the game early.\n\nThe group has to pick leaders, build important structures and basically create a society. They'd have to implement rules, and make some tough decisions.\n\nThings you'd have to ensure while playing:\n\n\-Morale is high (keep people entertained and comfortable)\n\n\-Food and clean water is being produced (things can go wrong making crops of food)\n\n\-Medical Staff and supplies are good (Doctors, Dentists, Therapists, Pharmacists and scientists and of course hospitals and labs are a must)\n\n\-Security Staff (security guards, policing of some sort, and potentially even a jail and courthouse)\n\n\-Future children are being taken care of and have schooling (Daycare, schooling, parks)\n\n\-People learn how to fight or use weapons (military, police, or combat experts are important)\n\n\-A sort of Colony Council is formed and functioning well (You can choose to make a democracy, dictatorship or anything you want)\n\n\-Researching and inventions to further the colony are a must.\n\n\-Progression of Colony success must continue to climb\n\nAt some point members of the colony would have to go back to land years later for supplies, and during these supply runs, they'd have the option to pick up new characters that would have different skills, but by taking people to the island it could lead to possible negative consequences. On the mainland, society has collapsed, and raiders run things for the most part. It's a world where the strongest survive. Every supply run could cost the colony members if anyone is killed.\n\nThe main goal of the colony (in order to win) would be: to learn to become completely self sufficient and to be able to survive a huge wave attack by the end of the game)\n\nThey'd have to become more intelligent, do more research and replace things like GAS and OIL, with products they can produce themselves over time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere's always a possibility of being tracked down by raiders or pirates. Land battles might ensue. Another issue is taking in the wrong survivor from the mainland, them stealing a boat and taking off and leading enemies to the island. This can also lead to land battles.\n\nWhile most games like this are strategy games you play overlooking the location you run, I'd vouch for it to be a more story driven game in which there are multiple possible endings. You can control one person and you can pursue relationships, start a family (or not), you can customize yourself, build your own buildings designed the way you want (or choose auto-build), and much more.\n\nA game like that would probably be too complex to build, but I like the idea of it anyway. If only there were developers willing to make something like that, but it's just a fantasy for now."
hcnyq8,Browser roleplaying text game,"Basically a bunch of chat rooms, but the twist is players create the content - they choose a location, ""road to x"" for an example, and they may add a tavern, a waterfall, etc. with a description, to that location, and it becomes a new chat room. If the location gets enough upvotes and visits per month, it stays in the game. Dev would be responsible for creating the skeleton of a world, (cliche medieval high fantasy setting maybe) and tempering some of the inevitable goofballs.\n\nYes, I did google and find some similar stuff, but none seem to really incorporate the player content into a consistent world.\n\nWould anyone play it? I think so, there's tooooons of plain text roleplaying games online with decent activity, but they all seem so niche. There's demand for a general purpose text rpg, and user created content would be a bonus."
hckfjc,"a 3D beat-'em-up with heavy combat, a focus on gore, and a Dark Souls esque atmosphere","You awaken one day, unsure of who or where you are. You are hanging from a steel cross by chains, one of which is a hook impaled through your chest. Around you are thousands of others, each hanging from their own cross, in a wide open pit. All of you are wearing identical helmets, which appear to be bolted to your skull. Suddenly, you're in free-fall, tumbling down the pit, until the chains holding up your cross go taut again, bringing you to a sudden halt, which shatters your arms and legs, and digs the hook deeper into your chest. Just below you is a table of stone, illuminated dimly, surrounded by darkness. An oversized creature wielding a similarly oversized butcher's knife arrives and hacks your arms and legs off just past the joints. There isn't long until you pass out.\n\nSome time later, you awaken, in a graveyard, at the bottom of a cliff, below a massive tower which reaches above the clouds. Your forearms and your calves, and obviously hands and feet, are gone, replaced with steel replicas of balled fists and bare feet. Pale, emaciated, and weak, you can only barely manage to even look around with the heavy helmet bolted permanently to your head. Surrounding you are those similar to you, at various states of decomposition.After some time, you build up the strength to drag yourself along the ground, then to crawl, and then to walk, and then to punch.\n\nYour steel arms are deadly weapons, if unwieldy, against the undead and mutated that infest the world around you. With a decisive blow, you can crack their skulls wide open, splattering the ground with their blood and brains and producing shrapnel of broken bone. Once you have the strength, they also make for a near-impenetrable block. Your legs are heavy, making your footsteps loud and you restricted to a brisk walk at best, but they also make your stance strong, and your balance very difficult to break.\n\nOver time, you will physically watch your character grow stronger, as they never get a shirt. Growing your strength will allow you greater control of your prosthetics, even to the point that you can run and jump. The physical consequences of your actions are a central theme, in fact, as the game would also feature a detailed gore system, accentuating the sheer damage you are capable of. Opponents' armor will dent under your fist, their bones will break, their flesh will bruise and tear. The environment, at times, will even give way to you. There is no lock that will protect a wooden door from you, for example, a prison's bars will bend from the force of your strikes, sometimes you will punch walls right down.\n\nBecause you do not have opposable thumbs, or any equipment, or the ability to speak, though, you have to rely on others who you will meet along your journey to do things for you. Around these parts, apparently, people are used to occasionally meeting a traveler with metal arms and legs trying to ascend the tower, who usually persists despite their insistence that the tower is an ancient relic, crawling with horrible monsters, with nothing left of value to be taken from it. They can operate machinery, open steel doors, and even change your equipment for you, if you can aid them in getting through an area, usually by killing everything in an area so they can safely pass through, and sometimes by breaking down obstacles that they cannot otherwise circumnavigate.\n\nThe combat would be reminiscent of 2018's God of War, with a touch of Sekiro. A focus on the hard-hitting combat animations, blocking, dodging, parrying, combos, etc. Your attacks are, for the most part, commitments, and you should strategize accordingly. Parrying in particular is important, as when you're putting your arms up to block, if you follow through, few enemies can withstand you simply shoving their attack aside. But when you're blocking, you're holding up your heavy arms, which is tiring, so you can't do it forever, even if you're at the max strength. Dodging is similarly exhausting, since it's hard to move those heavy legs so fast.\n\nOver the course of the game, in a narrative communicated through almost entirely unbroken gameplay, you explore this strange, half-dead world, and uncover who made you what you are, and potentially why. All the while, you go through varied locations, fighting a variety of enemies and bosses. Standard stuff there."
hck927,Need help with my game!,So I've been working on a small game and I feel like it's not finished yet for publishing.\n\nhere is a YT link to see some raw gameplay of the game\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1\_Mq\_B-5Xo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1_Mq_B-5Xo)\n\nbut my question to you is:\n\n* What kind of upgrades can you buy whit the coins you get?\n* What kind of cosmetics would be cool?  (like different color backgrounds)\n* What kind of upgrades can you randomly get while playing?
hchgi1,Earth MMO,How about a zombie apocalypse game with base building but the map is the entire earth like how flight simulator 2020 modelled the entire earth ....

And also play an optional single player mode  that goes through the story of a group of people ..
hchdsk,Beat Bros.,"A rhythm game that mixes modern platforming, RPG, and rhythm styles of gameplay, while all the characters are paper thin. For the RPG parts, think of something like Crypt of the NecroDancer/Cadence of Hyrule. You have to jump and fight to the beat, and you can pick up items to make fighting easier. For the platforming parts, you have to jump to the beat. The rhythm styles are present in both parts of gameplay. You play as a young boy named Reed who wanted to join his middle school band. He applied, and when he got home, he was met with two people fighting. Once they see him, they make him pick a side. The side opposite of the one picked pulls a Sonic Mania Encore Mode on you and turns into a bad guy. Then, the one who's with you says, ""We have to defeat him!"" So then, Reed gets warped into an alternate reality. And that one person with him. So there are Eight Worlds. Each world has a corresponding order. You start with Platforming, then go the RPG parts, then more RPG, and then the Platforming boss fight. Think of it as something like Mario. That's how it pretty much is for each world, in some cases. How you defeat each boss is like a Paper Mario esque Battle System. \n\nThat's my whole idea. I hope people react positively to it."
hch9il,Ideas,"Just me who thinks a game focusing on the emerging gang scene in the UK would be quite popular, it could be nothing like Gta and it could be great if done right , being an individual who understands the ‘scene’ it’s harder to put into words how i can imagine it but i think it could be really people with young adults especially in the UK and there isn’t really any games like it, abit of a brief for people who don’t really understand my idea , say you was a teen living in london, the amount of gang violence and territorial disputes that go on there is ridiculous, but real and i feel like i game not so much showing off this side of the UK but more of an insight as to what actually goes on the streets as i feel like games like gta don’t even capture what really goes down on the streets as accurately as it could do"
hcd5ne,VR Naruto Fighting Game utilizing hand tracking,"This would probably insane to code and develop and everything so I'll have to settle with my imagination, but with vr continually improving and hand tracking seems like it's going to be the next step, I was thinking how cool it would be to see a naruto vr fighting game where you form the hand signs to a specific jutsu and can fight against cpus or other people. Although you would have to learn and memorize a bunch of different hand signs and jutsus i think that this would be a pretty cool game. (Also sorry if this is a commonly posted idea, I've never been on this sub before. I just thought of it and found this sub)"

hc1qhz,How about a Roman Republic game.,I think it would be awesome to see a game that let you be a senator in the Roman Republic. you could maybe start a few years before Cicero's year. then you go all the way up to Caesar's death and the rise of Augustus. I think that would be a kick-ass game!
hc0hdb,An RPG where your abilities are based on how the world perceives you and what they believe you are capable of.,"An idea for an RPG or Action-RPG that revolves around how legends are born and the power of belief.\n\nThere is no level, talent or skill system. You begin as a generic, year zero peasant... farmer, soldier, sheep herder or whatever with some sort of goal to go on an adventure and make something of yourself. You have basic movement options like running climbing and swimming, can wield and use weapons in a pretty amateurish fashion, can pick up and move or manipulate objects. \n\nNow as you progress throughout the game from this point you will be given opportunities to prove your worth, accomplishing feats of heroism or villainy. These may include things like saving a child from drowning, defending a merchant waylaid by highwaymen, scaling a dangerous peak, surviving a bad fall, etc etc. Depending on who saw you do these things and how you did them tales will spread amongst the townsfolk. These will began as rumors but become more real as time progresses and will define your key traits and skills.\n\nFor example let’s say you save this merchant from bandits and you do so by stealthily using a bow to pick them off. The merchant reaches the city and hits the tavern where he speaks of the wandering adventurer who slew 3 bandits with a bow without ever having been seen. You are now naturally stealthy and make less noise when moving, or maybe you have a smaller silhouette and NPCs need to get closer to realize you’re there. But what if the merchant says you must’ve hit those bandits from something like 200 yards and doesn’t really harp on you being quiet? You now have less arrow drop using the bow, or your arrows travel much further and faster. Maybe the merchant says you hit each bandit directly between the eyes and it was a sight to behold. You now have ‘deadeye’ capabilities or natural auto-aim.\n\nI imagine there would be a sort of “telephone” type system for this where each little tale would be twisted and exaggerated as it’s told and spread. You could reinforce the skill by duplicating a similar feat and make it better. But maybe you mess up and fail something spectacularly? Like say you’re running about town and trip over an object. Now the story is “he’s a crack shot with a bow but man does he have two left feet”. You now develop a wobbly gait and are more prone to being knocked over, losing your balance or tripping. \n\nI’m still workshopping a lot of this and trying to sort out some fun ideas and example situations. Like if people stop talking about you, you’ll lose these abilities over time. My thought is that this would exist in sort of an early dark ages settings with some fantastical elements and couched deeply in satire. As the tales are stretched out and over embellished you gain ridiculous powers but they can also become ridiculous negatives.\n\nMaybe someone watches you fall off a building and barely survive hitting the ground. As the story is passed it goes from a 2 story building to a 4 story one and then to a tower. Enjoy doing super hero landing and not taking fall damage you jump off of something. \n\nThe core gameplay loop would consist of you just trying to go through life and follow some sort of simple plot (no idea on story yet) while the actions you take and how you decide to play the game can only influence and not decide what abilities you get. If you decide to use your fists to do the talking you’ll see rumors revolving around your brawling ability but as to what those rumors are you’ll have very little input. It may be that you gain incredible endurance because you fought 10 men at once, might be that you get hands of stone because they said you were KOing everyone in a single punch. \n\nI have a general idea of a subplot based on all the gods in a type of Olympus looking down from on high and basically using you as a guinea pig for gambling and placing wagers on. They’d give little inputs to screw up sure things, or make you succeed in a one in a million shot.\n\nLet me know if this doesn’t make sense. Will update more after I sleep a bit."
hbxg5l,Arena shooter with deck building system,Plays like standard arena shooter like quake and unreal . However what sets this game apart is there is a deckbuilding system which are buffs to your character which can be increased or decreased for your preference. And at each round you choose the percentage of each buff you want to increase or decrease it's potency but you have to be careful as at each threshold there's a negative effect ( for example increased armour would mean reduced health or speed ). The buffs will change each round so you will have to alter each one so that you have the most effective loadout for your playstyle.
hbxeri,Frogger meets X (No Future),"I want to make games like most because I'm fasinated with all the mechanics. But I don't have the drive to make things yet. I get encourgment when someone likes said Idea so here's the current one. It's simple.\n\nFrogger meets X means Frogger style movement plus X genre. You could even have FPS as X. The concept isn't new but I feel like you have more control over a grid based environment with snap to grid movement.\n\nThis is just a thought since I'm learning to code but procrastinating on it. A tile system where each ""tile"" represents a square that goes in the grid. Each tile may have layers. So for instance your player can be on a land or floor tile but can't move into a wall tile.\n\nThe start of dev would be introducing new mechanics till the movement doesn't feel so boring. It would start off turn based and the sequel would be real time since that's too advanced. Stop motion is more consistant.\n\nOh I just rememberd the current state of the idea; No Future (for turn based atleast). You can see what the enemy's next move is and in some cases so can they. When your foe dies they have ""No Future"" remaining. This could later turn into pvp ect."

hbpd6h,"A game of ""The Road"" (book)","If anyone has read it will understand why it would be an awesome game.\n\nMany aspects could be borrowed from the last of us but greatly improved.\n\nFor me, it would be better in a Detroit become human style, you mostly decide, walk, picks up things...\n\nSince combat isn't a really present aspect of the game, it's possible to focus mainly on the survival, and relationship. Fear has to be present as well, since the book keeps you tense most of the time.\n\nOne of the things that I find would be very interesting would be a limited storage system (the shopping cart they drag around). Player would find items not very often, but with limited space, choosing what to get rid of would be hard\n\nI think it would be awesome to see such an incredible book come to life in game form. The story is very unique.\n\nAnd I don't want to get into the book too much, but it is important to say the writing plays a huge role here. The sentences are VERY short and commas are rare. This creates constant fear and suspense. Though it should be slow paced, this way it makes it very exciting to read. The game should be able (somehow) to do the same. Where it should be just a walk in the snow, the player will always fear for his and the son's survival.\n\nI believe the relationship between the two would be the most impactful thing from the game."

hbk9lg,A Goblin tribe-management simulation game on mobile,"Hi, guys I've never actually posted anything on Reddit, so do feel free to correct me if anything's wrong.\n\nI'd also like to preface the post by saying that I don't have any knowledge or experience regarding making video games, this idea has stuck to me like a leech and I can't get any work done cause I keep day-dreaming about it. I suppose I just need someone who knows about games to tell me it's stupid so I can go about my way. I've read up on the guidelines and I'll try to keep everything solely related to game mechanics, at least to the degree I understand and try to make it as clear and concise as I can. So, bear with me. Thanks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOK, I'll try to give an outline before going in-depth. It is a 2-d isometric-ish game that uses 3 maps? the player acts as a chieftain which gives the overall orders, like sending trading/raiding parties, ordering buildings built, exploration etc. you know, kinda like AOE, you tell which villager to do what and they go do it, you don't have direct control of villagers though, but you get direct control when there are fights.\n\n* The first map is the dungeon or the tribe map where the goblins build houses, buildings and fortifications etc. Pretty simplistic.\n* The second map is the world map this is where the chief sends out it's choice goblin parties to explore and interact, similar to Frostpunk.\n* and lastly the final map is the fight maps this is where the goblins, humanoids and other monsters fight. You get direct control of the goblins here and can micro-manage or group up on the enemies.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe games revolves around the player gaining exp through actions such as mining, building, fighting, trading etc. and each level you get 10 stat points, the player may put stat points into their chosen goblins (stats are explained below). The game would begin with 5 or 10 goblins with randomized stats between 1-5 (out of a max of 20) and the player can customize each goblin any way they like.\n\n \n\nHowever, as you level and gain more experience, you get the opportunity to evolve in another species altogether, that will be dependent on the actions the goblins took as a tribe. There is more on that below but in a gist they would get to choose from Ogres, Hobgoblins and Orcs. Evolving would give a permanent stat boost to all goblins in the tribe, depending on their different evolution choice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen it comes to graphics, I was thinking simplistic, very vibrant in color, a fantasy feel (there is a mobile game called Tamer its very similar to what I'm thinking about) . The animations and such be cartoon-ish, with goofy looking characters.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStat Explanation (it's pretty self-explanatory, to be honest. But, I'll divide it into 9 parts.)\n\n* Red bar or strength \n\n|Fights|good at melee dmg and tanking|\n|:-|:-|\n|Social|good at intimidation and provocation|\n|Work|guarding and escort duties|\n\n* Green bar or dexterity\n\n|Fights|good at archery and short swords, with chance to crit. |\n|:-|:-|\n|Social|good at charm and barter|\n|Work|trade and subterfuge|\n\n* Blue bar or intelligence\n\n|Fights|spells (want to make it very difficult to cast spells, more on that below) and fuckall|\n|:-|:-|\n|Social|good at persuasion and pacification |\n|Work|research and crafting|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow we move onto the spells part. I was thinking that dividing spells into 2 parts would be a good idea. The goblins would either steal or convince a species to teach them 1 element of their species. The element is utilized through 2 ways: Arcana (which the humanoids use) and voodoo (which the monsters use.) Not all monsters can use magic though (again more on that later.) Also the goblins only have 2 slots for Arcana or voodoo elements, and they don't mix with the other magic system.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* You learn Arcana spells through humanoids ('why' is, imo, part of lore so skipping that.) These spell count as chanting spells and would require the goblins to learn the humanoid language, again through subterfuge or charm. the combination chosen would give them the ability to cast an ultimate combination spell. \n\n1. 1 goblin (with sufficiently high intelligence) can use only 1 element, and multiple goblins would cast a combination, obviously Arcana is powerful but it requires goblins to spend time chanting. Arcana is also used in research, and goblins capable of using certain Arcana would be require to spend their energy to satisfy an ally's request.\n\n|race|magic element 1|magic element 2|combination|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|humans|fire |water|steam|\n|elves|water|earth|nature|\n|dwarfs|earth|air|dust|\n|dragons|air|fire|inferno|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* You learn Voodoo through monsters (more on monsters later), (maybe learning other monster language mission, here too?) the voodoo spells are weaker than magic and is learned by either destroying or befriending a monster tribes. However, voodoo is quicker to cast than Arcana. The voodoo magic knowing monsters would randomly drop an element (because it would be easier to deal with monsters than humanoids). Also has the same functions and requirements as Arcana.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnto the map details then.\n\n* The Tribe Map would be the easiest to explain. This is your base of operations. This also used to be a dungeon, so the player would be allowed to extract a finite amount of resources to get them started. any goblin can collect resources, by dexterity goblins are faster at it. This is where the various building will be built that can craft items, research and such. This is also where defenses will be built, and said fortifications it will reflect in the fight maps. they will also build houses to replenish their numbers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* The World Map, this is where all the main games mechanics are operated. I'll try and make a list to make my thoughts a bit more organized.\n\n1. You send out a mixture of goblin parties to go capture dungeons; to trade/raid humanoid villages, monster villages, humanoid/monster caravans or adventurer groups.\n2. On the map there will be dungeons, this is where resources can be mined and hunted, they refresh after a timer. humanoid and monsters would be competing for them as well. Once captured after a fight, goblins would post guards and then send other goblins to explore the dungeons for resources, also has a change to find un-craftable rare items. Enemies would periodically send raiding parties to capture the dungeon.\n3. On the map there will also be villages and cities, you could pillage and raid (just theft, or kill everyone). Alternatively, you can befriend them, trade and protect them form enemies.\n4. The goblins with their various skills would be allowed to use social skills to make friends or enemies. A sneaky goblin would go near humanoids to learn their language, or a suave one would build their reputation by aiding them and requesting to learn their language, same for monsters.\n5. There would be monster tribe territory and humanoid kingdom territory, going into which unannounced would lead to attacks.\n6. The humanoid species implicitly distrusts goblins to extensive aid will be required to gain their trust.\n7. There will be about 6 monster species, only 2 will be able to cast voodoo spell. Goblin can befriend them with their relevant social stat check. So, diplomatic parties have to have a goblin that has the relevant skill high enough to impress them. Same for humanoid species.\n8. The goblins can choose to be belligerent if they fight everyone, peaceful if they try to befriend everyone or deceitful if they try to do both. These check would determine which species they would evolve into. if belligerent = Ogre, if deceitful = hobgoblin, if peaceful = Orcs.\n9. If you lean the human language you could contact them to either help them if they ask for it. you could also find traitor humans that leak info you could use to pillage and steal, then share the loot with the human. Same for monster tribe, because like different humanoids are at odds with each other, the monsters are also at odds with each other.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Lastly the Fight map, I look at the fight bit as a real-time chaotic mess. where goblin numbers are thrown at everything. The player WILL lose the goblins in fights. If you defeat the enemy, you DON'T kill them automatically, they just get knocked out. how ever you have the option to swarm them and kill them, this would contribute towards their ogre evolution, sparing would lead to other 2 evolution. the fights will be like AOE, where you could command them individually or in swarms.\n\n1. The adventurers would fight with few people, in a coordinated manner, and run away if they feel threatened.\n2. The monsters would use either use similar swarm tactics or fight in coordinated armies. They may run depending on the species.\n3. The Humanoid armies would never run and use the swarm tactics.\n4. if your attacking a city or defending, the fortification would appear like towers on the maps, on which the units would go and attack with high damage and invulnerability, however the doors to the towers must be guarded or they can be overtaken. \n5. The skills of goblins would effect how they perform on the battlefield. If a goblin has very low agility he would trip and fall, if someone's nearby they would try and grab, if they have low strength, both fall. If low intelligence, can't follow orders correctly. If low strength, they cant be knocked away or even killed pretty easily.\n6. Once the aforementioned events happen, they would be vulnerable to attacks, as a goblin's strength lies in its numbers. \n7. 1 goblin can't 1v1 a humanoid and some monsters.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's about it, those are all the thoughts I had on it. I tried to keep it just around the mechanics bit, and tried to organize it, the best I could, but then again I might be mistaken, so do feel free to correct it. I would appreciate your honest opinion on this, I'm not particularly attached to the idea so you can be as brutal as you like, I don't mind. It's just that, It's been on my mind for quite a while and it started to hinder my life, cause I'd just keep day-dreaming about it all day and get no work done. Thanks a lot for reading!"
hbj0h8,A game based on me and my friends comic book from years ago,"Sort of a beat‘em up/3D platformer with a strategy level. \n\n1. Killer Wax - Defeat all of the Wax Statues in the hideout. Switch between the characters and use their different powers to your advantage. \n2. Transform-o-Ray - Avoid the lasers and take over the Transformation machine. Monkey, Dodo and Bird enemies are present.\n3. A Wonder from Wanda - You play as a fairy, guiding the four heroes through the stage past obstacles in a Strategy-like manner \n4. Confusion City - Run through the city and distinguish similar-looking enemies from civilians. Must defeat all enemies. End-boss is Hirokazu (the main villain) and Oscar (one of the playable characters), like the previous parts, you must differentiate between Hirokazu and Oscar and they will switch round at fast speeds, making the level harder. \n5. City Destruction - After escaping, Hirokazu sends a Godzilla monster into the city and you must save civilians and defeat the monster boss.\n6. Frozen Terror - Ice Level; Collect five lost ice shard artefacts and defeat the Ice Monster."
hbgsg0,Night Terror- a open-world urban reverse-horror/ stealth game,"##**Summary**\n\nThis is an idea I have where you would play as a creature similar to [Night Stalker](https://i.redd.it/12c7xgjy4zx31.jpg) from Dota 2. You would inflict fear, use powers, evade detection and terrorize a small suburban community.\n\n##**Key Mechanic**\n\nThe main mechanic would be Fear, which is a status debuff you can inflict on humans. You can just striaght out kill them but that isn't as tasty (and doesn't give nearly as much XP) as scaring them, stalking them, playing cat and mouse and making them terrified out of their mind. However if you scare too much and their Fear gets to 100, they get overwhelmed by terror and have a heart attack and die, so you need to decide for yourself when is the right time to finish someone off.\n\n##**Gameplay**\n\nGameplay would consist of sneaking around the neighborhood, cutting power lines and scaring the shit out of NPCs befofe you devour them. This game would take place in a small suburban neighborhood however you would be able to enter most of the houses. It would be cool to have some destruction physics similar to R6 Siege so you could bust thru walls like the Kool-Aid man and scare the shit out of people or just make a mess out of their house.\n\nThere would also be an injury system for both you and the humans that could affect your movement speed (ex. Broken ankle) as well as make basic motor tasks harder (ex. Broken hand)\n\nThere would also be stealth elements and some sort of ""Wanted"" status similar to GTA stars because you want to be discrete and not attract attention, especially from the local law enforcement. Things that would raise the wanted level would be letting a victim get away or having witnesses call the police\n\n##**Story**\n\nIt clearly isnt a story focused game but story would be something like building up your lair/nest to open a portal that would connect your home plane to Earth and bring unspeakable horrors into the world\n\n##**Powers**\n\nAs you gain XP from your kills you would unlock powers and be able to upgrade them in your lair. Examples of powers would be a short range teleport, thermal vision for tracking people, and things that inflict fear like ""Nightmare Grasp"" and ""Aura of Fear""."
hbghjb,Game Plot Idea Help,"I having been mulling over a game idea for a bit. It has to do with time travel in a sense. There would be about 7 different time periods one can go to (neolithic, ancient grecoroman, medieval, colonial, industrial, modern, and future) but it would all occur on this one island the size of a country.\n\nThe actual time travel would only be that you can go into a family relative that existed/will exist at that time period. I should also mention that I was thinking about having this game be a puzzle game, similar to Myst or The Witness except this would have NPCs as well.\n\nWhile I have this idea for the general mechanics, I was wondering what plot (besides the cliche disaster to humans, or bad guy messes with time) would make sense to have a reason to go to all the time periods. Ideally it would be to solve some puzzle or learn sometime in each area.\n\nThanks for any help!"
hbdkks,Point &amp; Click game with consequences,"I don’t know if this is already implemented. In a lot of point and click games, the player will take something and no one notice it. What if the npc notice after it disappear for a certain amount of time. This could make the gameplay interesting."
hbb6bb,"A ""build your own troops"" kind of strategy game","First of all this is a huge project, but I have to clear my mind a bit so I'm writing it down. \n\nSo I don't know if any of you have played a flash game called battlecry. \nI played it a lot when I was around 15 years old.\n\nWell in short it just evolves around the idea that you have a certain amount of points per level. \nThe points are used to create soldiers by giving them equipment or traits from 5 categories, Race, Armor, Weapon, Offhand (shields and dagger ect.) and Special (which was like mounts and magic stuff).\n\nEvery item had a different cost of points, and the soldiers cost was just all those points added together.\n\nFor example you made, let's say, an Orcish bowman with plate armor. And named the soldier type ""the gren guard"" or something epic like that.\n\nSo Orc 5p +Shortbow 4p +Armor 7p =16p\n1 green guard cost 16p and 10 green guards 160p\n\nI'm thinking of implementing the same kind of ""Build your own army"" -mechanic with the kind of 3D battles known from something like the total war -series. \n \nCustom battles would be set up by deciding the amount of points for each army.\nThen having 10's or 100's of custom made soldiers battling against each other.\n\nIt could even have some kind of a campaign or anything."
hb6m3y,Making a 2D single screen platformer better.,"I am making a single screen 2D platformer that looks a bit like the levels in Towerfall Ascension. [(see Towerfall Asencion)](https://images.app.goo.gl/kGKXFRc1d6MNSFS28)\n\nThe levels have traps and bottom to top warping, and some basic enemies that are still being developed.\n\nMy idea for the level is to play out in increasingly difficult waves, something like Bloons TD games, where a set of enemies appear randomly across the level in waves and you have to kill them without dying. Dying 3 times is level over. However, I feel this level format is too bland and player may quickly feel uninterested. \n\nI need help trying the levels more interesting, make the player compelled to actually kill the enemies and what kind of reward he would get after 'clearing' the level."
hb6gse,A derelict spaceship explorer survival (horror?),"TL;DR A Dead Space-ish multiple spaceships explorer\n\nSo, I've been searching a lot for games like this, but, since you either get a full spaceship combat experience like EVE Online or a Spaceship crafter, like Space Engineers, it's kinda hard to find a proper spaceship exploration game. Picture this: a game like Dead Space 1, with all of his atmosphere and settings, but, instead of exploring 1 single ship, you get to explore multiples ship, some big some not, (and maybe some bases?). Kinda like Warframe, but completely single-player, and more survival focused. It doesn't have to be a complete horror game or a complete Survival Horror, but more centered around exploration. Maybe even get some ships that are infected or something, and you get to scavenge those to improve your own. What do you guys think?"
hb5lmt,An RPG where the player levels up by eating,"This is a cooking style, Survival RPG. \n\nThe player's stats are based on their diet. \nEating heavy foods can add mass, eating light gives agility. Foods can also give unique abilities and buffs, apart from just stats. \n\n\nTo progress, the player must gather ingredients from exploring the world and killing monsters, and learn new recipes for new dishes. New recipes can grant more skills and abilities\n\nCooking food is more like Alchemy in Kingdom Come:Deliverance. Players must combine ingredients using different procedures: boiling, grilling, roasting, etc. These procedures must be done in specific orders according to the recipe. These procedures also need independent resources like wood, water or metal pots. \n\nThe player can develop ""tastes"" for specific kinds of foods, if eaten overtime. Tastes give extra bonuses for eating said foods, but give debuffs if that specific food isn't eaten over time."

hb4f5c,"More of a tool than a game, but can we get A modern version of the Madden “create a team” uniform designer","As a kid I spent hours designing my perfect team uniforms in Madden. It was honestly my favorite part of the game.  I understand the NFL doesn’t want it to be a feature in Madden any more, but I would play good money for a game (ok, its not even a full fledged “game”, more of a utility) that would let me design my own sports team uniforms.\n\nSomething with more features than Madden had (import your own logo images, use gradients, resize and reposition stripes, build logos from letters “word art” style, etc), but without the learning curve of trying to learn to do stuff like this in photoshop. \n\nConsidering how much time sports fans spend debating their favorite uniforms and criticizing every new uniform a team unveils, I’m honestly surprised something like this didn’t already exist to cater to that community."
hb4762,Small open world (town game) where hero can stop time.,"The game would boil down into an achievement collection game.\n\n\nThe main character would discover that they have the power to stop and start time at will. While time is stopped they have free range of motion and can interact with things in their environment. \n\n\nThe open area would be the size of a small neighborhood or small town depending on how ambitious the developer is. And the player would have free reign to experiment. \n\n\nThe town's folk would go about their daily lives, the main character may even have to do ""normal"" things. But the premise would basically be experiment with your powers and see what can happen, or what you can make happen.\n\nWill edit in spacing later, typed on my phone and it's not working. Sorry."
hibk05,VR champion arena fighter with a twist," So first off I work in the games field so I know this isnt exactly easy.... Bu this idea I would like torefine or just talk about really.... so any ideas or commentary is welcome.  \n\nSo the idea is to create First Person VR fighting game with champions with base stats that can then be upgraded and augmented to better suit the play-style you want, which is the way most fighting games or arena fighters such as League of Legends has been treating champions. But the twist I propose is that all champions require a Team of 2 players to pilot.\n\n1 player controls the champion in real time, moving, attacking, dodging and everything. The way that a typical player would. Since this would be a VR game this would actually require some level of physical skill, giving it some barrier to entry that should appeal to the to the Tank/ Dps players of the world\n\nThe 2nd pilots job is to manage things like healing, damage mitigation, Special move gauges, Damage over time or ""DOT"" cleaning, outgoing Damage boosts etc. The 2nd pilot would work at like a minority report style AR User interface having to work in real time to stabilize their champions vital meters, including having control their special move meter and their ultimate move meter, as well as apply their buffs , they could upgrade to focus on say, healing and damage mitigation, or maybe DOT effectiveness and speed booting etc. This could be as physically intensive as the VR fight itself depending on design, but more likely it would be more of a technical skill, that would appease the Healer/Support type characters.\n\nTheese fights would take place in an actual arena, so traps and such could be added depending, but the real point in the Arena is seating. You could ""sell"" seats in the arena in VR for people to tune into their favorite fighters, competing.\n\nThe outlet for in game currency is buying augments for your champions, or your consoles, and then buying seats to Fighting tournament that could be run in seasons like any other game.   \n\n\nBasically I want a fun VR game that has replay-abilty and can also be an esport....thoughts? opinions? ideas?"

hi8u71,"Indie horror, thieves decide to hit a bank that is rumoured to have little to no security overnight","This one comes with lore, so get your popcorn ready.\n\nIn 1893, a bank was opened in a city. In 1895, a man named Randy McClain robbed this bank with his fiancé Edith. Originally, the plan was to have Edith distract the men inside while Randy snuck through the door to set up his dynamite on the vault door. Unfortunately for them, a local gang of outlaws caught wind of their robbery and were on their way to the scene.\n\nRandy lit the charge and walked back into the room. The explosion knocked the unsuspecting men over. He took out his gun and aimed it at them to ensure they wouldn’t fight back while Edith tied them up.\n\nMore dynamite was set, and a giant hole is blown through the side of the building for a quick escape. By this time, the gang had arrived and surrounded Edith. Their leader grabbed her and lifted his gun to her head. He threatened to shoot unless Randy gave up the money. Edith begged for her life, she pleaded for Randy to hand over his bag, but he turned away. Randy scurried through the front entrance where his horse was waiting, and with that, Edith was shot and killed.\n\nBefore the gang could pursue him, the lawmen arrived and were quick to neutralise anybody attempting to leave the scene. The sheriff noticed the bag of money held by Randy as he rode past. He readied his gun, and shot him twice in the back. The gang escaped, and the stolen money was returned to the bank.\n\nRandy and Edith had a baby together a few months prior to the robbery. Her name was Jodie. Due to her parent’s death, Jodie’s grandmother took care of her until she passed away of natural causes. By age 13, Jodie was alone. She would eventually join a gang of outlaws and become a criminal.\n\nIn 2003, 108 years after the bank robbery, the city has become much larger. The land where the bank once stood is now occupied by a new bank, a slightly larger building with a bigger vault.\n\nYou play as Joshua McClain, Randy’s great great grandson. Your family has a history in crime, and you’ve never cared to investigate further than that. Joshua’s record is fairly bare. Petty thievery and trespassing, but nothing major. He’s looking to hit a bigger score. Getting a crew together in a town like this isn’t a particularly difficult task, but finding a score worth taking is.\n\nOne of the thugs he wrangled up mentioned a bank that they’ve been scoping over the last few weeks. According to him, every guard is gone by 10 and there aren’t any working security cameras.\n\nThe crew all agrees that this bank is their best shot at a decent payday. Without guards or cameras, it’s as simple as it sounds. Or is it?\n\nSo that’s the story. If you couldn’t tell, the game would be an indie horror where you and a small group of thugs attempt to break into and rob a bank that’s haunted by Edith, a woman who was betrayed by your great great grandfather during a robbery that went south, and subsequently murdered. In terms of mechanics, you’d begin by finding a way into the building. Once you’re in, you have to break into the vault. This is a spooky building at night, so you’ll already be creeped out by the ambience. However, once you’re in the vault, Edith recognises you. This is the equivalent of picking up the first page in Slender (Edith will now stalk you). While looting the vault, you and your crew realise you’re trapped inside. Your goal is to escape the vault - which appears to be dimensionally transcendental - with *or without* them. Due to the constantly shifting vaults and pathways, you’ll struggle to find your way out. With any luck, you’ll survive Edith’s attacks and escape the bank. Don’t take too long though, because once the sun’s up the bank will open and you’ll be caught red handed. Hey, at least prison isn’t haunted."
hi54ed,Would it be possible to create an Anime like video game?,"Title says it all really but I mean like One Piece for example how do you develop a world building like that and characters like that both in looks and personality? \n\nFor example if I made a scene where you have to choose go to the shops at the start of the game and that item effects cosmetics of the character for the whole game and also each one gives certain unique benefits, how would I make that scene feel like you’re watching a One Piece episode, I was think maybe something along the lines of Zoro at Loguetown when shopping for swords with Tashigi\n\nBut what i’m most unsure about is the fighting in the game, how would I make fighting feel like you’re watching an actual Anime like One Piece or Naruto.\n\nAny opinions because I really want to try making my own stories like that but in game form and I need help I don’t know what to start looking at to help me try and achieve this idea."
hi4dfd,an fps with story mode and battle royale with elements as core part.,"the idea is a First-person shooter with different game modes like story mode, battle royale, capture the flag, and stuff like that.\n\nyou start the game for the first time by choosing 1 of the 4 core elements. water, grass, air, and fire. all of these have 3 different attacks or weapons and you either start with all 3 or need to gather them depending on the game mode.\n\nin the story mode you can level up your weapons or attacks and you can become stronger. this also makes you fight against your level people.\n\neach element has it's own special form and with that comes a special attack. in this form, you do more damage and are faster. the multiplier depends on each class.\n\nin the story mode, you can also unlock different elements to make the game a bit more fun. these all have their attacks and special form.\n\nthe weapons you find will change to your class when you find them so you can always use the stuff you find.\n\nthe map will constantly change so it remains fun and extra stuff can be like skins for a specific class or different classes with Christmas or Halloween.\n\nthe idea is pretty big but I still wanted to share it. let me know what you think!"

hhsdyf,An actual mmo rpg,"So recently I was rewatching some old shows such as sao and looking at old games and that got me thinking of a game idea which could either go really well or really bad but my idea is this a mmo rpg in where the only thing we control is how the character looks and we let the game choose the characters powers for example I make my character and it give me ice powers and another person dark energy powers and my reasoning for a game like this is it gets kindve annoying to see people overly choose on power over the other. I had this conversation with my brother and it was if naruto had a really ninja creation game 90% of players would choose to be an uchia because to be honest I would too so rather there is a game where people can pick how their character looks like and how they fight regarding swords fist guns but the game has a rng system for picking what kind of powers you get when it comes to dark powers, fire powers, ice powers the only issues would be the developers making the powers fair and making the powers have their unique abilities. The point of the game pretty much like most super powered shows because in these shows people don’t get to chose their powers they just have them and make the best they can out of them there’s so much more to explain when it comes to the number characters someone could have but this really just makes people more unique in a way"
hhs81p,Not Quite What You Seem,"You press start and it immediately goes into a tutorial. The setting around you is black and white all the important things around is red, for example text, you, and tutorial enemies. After completing the tutorial you wake up with a big sword through your chest and see that you have been chained up against a wall. Everything looks old and mossy, a hole in the wall allows a beam of sun to shine on to you. You break free from the chains and pull out the sword from your chest.(You would have to press buttons to escape like something from Detroit become Human. For example to free yourself from Arm Chain 1 you would have to hold Y or something.). You look at the sword that was impaling you, on the hilt of the sword you see three Diamond Shaped indents. Looking back closely at the place you woke up you would see three small gray diamond Runes. Perfect for your sword, (Cutscene) you try to put them in the indents but they just fall out. You find a sheath for your sword nearby that has unreadable ancient text on it.\n\nYou push open the great stone doors in front of you and are greeted by a thick forest, but in the distance you can see a town(A medieval looking town). You have to slice through some vines and jump over fallen trees, but eventually you get to the town and a skinny child asks you what your name is, instinctively you blurt out Edread Istvan (ee-dread i-s-t-van. The ""i"" is like the i in sister). She says that name sounds familiar and that your sword looks cool. You have some options to pick from of how you will reply to the girl, some examples are rude, nice, or silent. Either way she wants to come with you. You ask why and find out she's an orphan (Helping her would be like helping Raptallia from Legend of The Shield Hero). She says her name is Kye Clayton. \n\nSome big important quests happen like slaying a Zombie Dragon. You can get Magic runes for your sword by a wizard you meet in a hidden tower. The Wizard at first is nervous around you but eventually is more warm. The Wizard can make magic runes that fit into your sword's indents, all he needs is magic essence from killed monsters and some coins. Some abilities can be fire balls, a magic slash(like a skyward strike), and a lightning strike. You are soon known as a hero around the world, on the way you learn more about yourself gently hinting at you being an evil super human. Then a king gives you a quest to slay a skeleton that has been seen to cast ancient spells. \n\nWhile on that journey, you learn your true identity as a human so evil they had to chain you up and seal you into the dreamscape with three magical sealing runes infused into a sword, forever remembered in history. The magic skeleton confirms this when it sees your sword, saying that it was your mentor. After that your character passes out. But when you wake up you are on top of the skeleton's tower, holding a great black sword and the world around you is glowing from fire, the skeleton standing behind you. Kye is no where to be found and the game ends. \n\nQUICK NOTES\n\nThe game would be in 3d kinda looking like a mix of Botw and Dark Souls.\n\nTheir could be magic wands or bows\n\nYou never see your character. \n\nMaybe there could be a sequel where Kye tries to fix the world and Edread.\n\nI wrote this on mobile :D\nPlease credit me if you use this for some reason\n\nI don't know if there would be any special mechanics besides your sword's runes"
hhrnjx,"A Pokemon clone, but the trainable creatures are based on real bird species.","Abilities, powers, and stats would be based on the habitat, feeding, and behavior of the bird species.

A few dinosaurs may be included as boss battles.\n\nThe trainers and ""humans"" would be forest mammals like beavers, bears, and badgers."
hhpfg0,New Matrix video game idea,"I've been thinking lately, right now would be a great time for a new matrix game to be announced. With the new movie coming and console and pc gaming having advanced by multiples of 10 since the last matrix game was released (and not to mention the explosion of VR), we could really see a game that lives up to the franchise name and excites fans as much as the new movie does.\n\nLike the movies, the game would need to push technological boundaries and pioneer groundbreaking technology. Additionally, the game would need to be as visually stunning and immersive as the films themselves. Thus, it is imperative that the game utilizes the best graphical technologies available. One of the main things I always found missing in the first two games was the beautiful visuals of the movies. Hell, I remember watching Reloaded and seeing the *fibers* of Neo's coat as he leveled tens of Smiths at a time. The VFX on the entire series was beautiful and groundbreaking and the game should be the same.\n\nAdditionally, I believe the game should be groundbreaking in other ways. Most notably in it's scale and world building. Afterall, the matrix is about a giant, open, *vitrual* world where anything is possible. I've always believed that the best way to capture the essence and allure of the matrix is through an open world game because it best represents what the matrix is (a place where literally anything is possible). Thus, I believe the new game needs to be open world and massive (and beautiful).\n\nGames like GTA5 and developers like Rockstar games have already proven the massive popularity of such games and have already shown blueprints for such games to succeed. Something along the lines of GTA5 would be great and I think Rockstar games would be a great candidate to develop it.\n\nSO, on to the main important necessities of the game:\n\n* BEAUTIFUL realistic graphics that capture the original movies style/look\n* OPEN world game format that offers ultimate FREEDOM (I know, kinda counter the whole matrix, free is not free, thing) and multiple ways to play\n* MASSIVE world and city to explore and play in (players should feel like THEY are red pills- new recruits/rebels)\n\nTo get a little more specific these are the game modes that I see as what would make the game great and capture the real potential of the matrix as a game franchise and movie tie-in:\n\nSingle-player open world game play where players would play as red pills initially escaping the matrix and then exploring and performing mini-missions inside it.\n\n* players can jack in and out of the matrix and would be able to explore around their real world ship (and possibly further).\n* players can, from the loading construct and graphical loading page of the game, load custom training programs and levels, weapons, clothing, and vehicles- all that are highly customizable.\n* players can collect ""code-snippets"" from the matrix that gives them access to cars, parts, clothing, levels, and other customizations outside the matrix.\n* players can also save cars and weapons and other items from in game when they 'jack-out' and use those the next time they 'jack-in' or to build custom levels/experiences.\n* when in the loading construct/building mode, players can build custom levels and training simulations from templates already available, content found and saved in game, and stuff built by other users. Additionally players can buy special/custom levels/experiences in this mode. This can include things like the dojo training construct to others such as those referenced and seen in the animatrix and enter the matrix. Again, like elsewhere in the game/world (should emphasize the meta-ness of this all), ultimate freedom and customization is stressed.\n* Lastly, players can do all of this online with other players. The building/loading construct means creating an online marketplace for players to share creations and unique customizations/mods (and to buy official expansion material). It also means players can not only play single player missions in the open world of the matrix by themselves, but can also play online mode with other players that includes unique and special gameplay modes and missions.\n* Lastly lastly, because it's the matrix and we're talking false realities etc, the game should be developed (in parallel) as a VR game and should release on VR platforms alongside traditional ones. It is my belief that this game's full potential is released when played in VR.\n* Lastly, lastly, lastly, I want to stress again the freedom and openness of the game and further that it should have many built in and not explained secrets and easter eggs for players to find. Abilities and progress through the game should not be explicitly tracked or displayed (for one, it's an open world non-linear game), and players true and full abilities and potential should be a complete mystery to the player (and herein should lie easter eggs of its own) and require them to discover it themselves as they explore their way through the world.\n\nI think there is so much potential and material in the Matrix Universe to make a fantastic game and one that really captures users and their fascination with the Matrix, and I believe this format and blueprint is the key to unleashing that. This is the game I want to play.\n\nThis is something that would reallly excite me and I think I am not alone on this. Please let me know your thoughts on this and what your level of excitement would be. Also, I will be mocking up some basic game levels/flow to prove the concept in web or Unity3d and to receive feedback.\n\nLet me know what you think and thanks guys!"

hhme4t,Need help on Isometric game ideas that is a mixture of tycoon/RPG/multiplayer (leaderboards)?,"I'm currently doing A-Levels, I need a game project idea and would like to take up a big game project as a hobby to hopefully put on steam. \n\nI have really liked the idea of isometric game design, it can be quite nice, modern, and easy to make (considering I'm a solo developer). I brain-stormed some ideas for a cool, original game ideas and I'd like to go towards a tycoon/simulation game genre. I'd like game ideas where you have to play a lot to progress, not just play in one day and finish the game. So I'd like to add some RPG elements?\n\nI have two ideas at the moment that I really like (welcome to more ideas, I need help lol):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Gangsta (warefare) type tycoon game where you build, manage a drug dealing business. Options to purchase lots of buildings, warehouses etc. make some labs and farms, try and stay out of the way of the police, involve some shooting mechanic if police do decide to arrive. Eventually spread across the globe and go against players in the world with the net worth of your whole profile? OR\n2. Movie Theatre business type game where you manage (multiple) theatres, manage the shows, entertainment, arcade etc.\n\nTo be honest I don't even know if those game ideas have a lot to off of from, but hey any help would be appreciated!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCheers"

hheubo,Tourist simulator with learning foreign languages,"Hi, English isn't my native language and sometimes I think about interactive ways of learning foreign languages, I have an idea of educational game where you play as a tourist in different countries/cities and get a some quest by your language level (find a place/person/do something etc), you need to speak with NPCs and interact with items with using language that you learn."
hhdufi,An educational game where you can play as prehistoric animals.,"It would be a basic survival game, except it would star prehistoric animals, and try to educate the player about the prehistoric life. Imagine ancestors: the humankind odyssey, but more educational and realistic. \n\nThere are so many different periods and locations which could be adapted into a game, the sequel possibilities would be endless."
hhajns,Post-Apocalyptic Horror Game Plot,"This is pretty much a brief summary of some main plot points \n\nThis is set in 2033. It has been 5 years since the Beasts ravaged the Earth. \n\nIn a world ruined by beasts sent straight from Hell, an African American ex-soldier from Virginia decides to run away from the militia group he joined after an event traumatizes him (they kill three young brothers). His step-brother, who oversees the militia, had warned him before if he fled he would come after him and kill him for leaving. While on the run to go to Canada, the African American man spots a fire burning in his trip through the woods. The man ends up spotting a lynching going on with three African Americans by a group of soldiers (men and women) and five hooded individuals. They kill the first guy when he tries to fight and escape than work on a 16 year old and his 13 year old sister. The man sees all this, hesitant at first but ultimately deciding he should intervene hoping to prevent the traumatic event he saw earlier from happening again. The man kills the group of soldiers but the hooded man were able to get away. The 16-year-old, his sister and the man were able to flee away from the scene. The man let’s the siblings accompany him knowing the terrorist group will be looking for revenge. More to come."
hh9rxr,Microtransactions,"Inspired by EA and the year 2020, a simple game idea came to me... \n\nWhat if lootboxes in a game only gave lootboxes as prizes? Imagine the possibilities: an infinite lootbox simulator where grinding for lootboxes provided a chance to get rare or ultra rare lootboxes? Those rare lootboxes provide ultra rare lootboxes that can be sold for points to unlock more lootboxes? Merchandise could be lootbox skins, lootbox colors and lootbox cosmetics."
hh6j6f,A mmo Game concept,I got inspiration from an anime called The shield hero. This game will be ps4 and pc only (cause of the controls). \n\nYou would start by picking a class and a race.  Each race will have different traits special to them.   \nRaces:\n\nDemi - human: can have all classes but different kinds of demi-human have different traits. cant have filolial.  \nHuman - have all classes but filolial  \nHero - Can have all classes but filolial  \nFilolial - Only 1 class  \nClasses:\n\n1. Shield\n2. Sword\n3. bow\n4. spear\n5. magic\n6. scythe\n7. Fan\n8. Filolial - special\n\nThe goal of the game is to defeat the hoards (The whole game will be different than the anime it will be endless hoards.) You can go out into the world and level up before you and your team are teleported into the hoard zones. (There will be a timer on your screen telling you when hoards will start.) If you die or finish the game (reach level 160) you may change your character or keep going. When you reach level 80 you go to the temple to get a Class upgrade. Each wave has a level set and a player set ( so like 80 players within level 0 - 30 vs 1 boss and 100 mini monsters. which increase with ever level). There will be a pvp and a pvpve  game mode. The special thing with this game is that Each boss gives your weapon a new special correlating with the boss (So if there is a water boss you would get a water ability correlating to the weapon you have.)   \nIf you have questions ask i know my explanation is everywhere please ask questions if you have them.
hh4u5n,A Grand Strategy game,"I’ve been looking at the market for RTS games and I’ve noticed something: there are no really simple ones. I’m talking no resources, just money derived from oil fields and the like. Money=buildings+units (and with my strategy, money=allies). Just basic stuff, simple enough for a 10 year old to play. It’s not that I don’t like the complicated stuff, but sometimes I just want to get into some light gaming rather than go all-in.\n\nTLDR: RTS where money is the only resource"
hh4dtk,Looking for ideas for a card mobile game,"Hey, I'm looking for a ""new"" mechanic or idea for a card game, some game like hearthstone or clash royale. Basically cards vs cards, but with something new.  I started by making a game that you have a chest every 5 hours and it gives you a card, basically the game is to complete your collection. But I want something else with this, some way to play these cards against other players and be able to earn money to open more chests. \n\nThanks for your time :)."

hgvok3,Cartography Game,"I’m thinking of a single/two player game where the player(s) spawns in a randomly generated labyrinth. They are tasked with mapping it out. Dying even once deletes your progress and you’re returned to the main menu, to encourage more caution. A playthrough should last about an hour(?)\n\nPlayers start with a paper/pen mapping system (roughly drawing a room will snap it into the actual shape) and a torch (battery included) but can pick up better equipment along the way- there can be electrical (good but high-maintenance/unreliable), old-fashioned (decent and reliable) or high-tech (brilliant but single use, risky to use or both).\n\nThere will also be (unique)creatures that don’t actively hunt you down but will attack you if they  notice you along their randomly-assigned ‘patrol routes’. You get bonus points for figuring their patrol routes out. You *can* fight them, but it’s *probably* a *very* bad idea.\n\nOnce you’re sure your map is correct, you can submit it at a terminal and will be evaluated. If it’s even slightly incorrect, you fail. If it’s 100% accurate, then you win!\n\nA multiplayer mechanic would also be cool, like you could kill your opponent and steal their map data to hasten your progress, or maybe team up with them and make it to the finish together.\n\nAs for story, well, I have no clue.\n\nAnyway, thanks for reading my idea :D"
hgqlwx,Gta type /serious /fun /Online/Offline Free roam /Chicago game,"Now This is my first pitch. So Let me explain the setting , The game takes place on the optional side of chicago during 2016. Depending on which side your on different gang cliques are optonial , the cliques will be reallie cliques and you will go through a traumatizing / sad / happy  and amazing journey with your own Character. You might be like ""What is so fun about this?"" Think of the story mode like a MA tv show like Power. Your character will start from the bottom and make it to the top And you watch him along the way. No Not only its going to be serious but fun. Similiar to the way gta made franklin but this is not about him. I dont have to much about online but Basically Online will have the whole city (So will offline) That you explore witth Other people online. I forgot to say before you Choose your clique you choose the gang you want to be Ex: Bd Is the gang but the clique is oblock Or something like that. So if you and another online player chose that on storymode then it will transfer online and he and everyone else who chose your gang . But it will also have craazy heist and flying vehicles. But it will be like the story mode on the optional Rp servers.

hgmh8l,"5v5 CQB Shooter, Each Team Has a Commander","Essentially the gameplay is a CQB shooter, similar to CS:GO or R6S.\n\nHowever, each team has a commander that is spectating and calling the shots.\n\nThe commander can:\n\n\+ See first person view of their soldiers through helmet cam.\n\n\+ Monitor certain security video feeds that their soldiers cannot see.\n\n\+ Hack certain systems, suck as automatic doors, lights, alarms or even hack the opposing commanders system.\n\nThe commanders role is very similar to the mastermind in Resident Evil: Resistance.\n\nThis makes the 5 soldiers truly feel like soldiers as their job isn't so much to think as it is to take orders and utilize quick reactions. The commander has a stressful responsibility to protect and guide their soldiers and take full responsibility for a mission failure."
hgksiq,Space themed rpg,"I’ve always enjoyed space themed games. I feel like a outer worlds, Star Wars, Futurama RPG would be amazing.\n\nStarting out as a young adoring space traveler or something that can join a crew for a job. Rising up the ranks of the crew while traveling all over space. Exploring different planets for jobs like deliveries or “treasure” hunting, assassin missions, races, hunting rare game,  whatever, there are so many possibilities.\n\nYou would get to see different aliens. Not all aliens are human like it so it could be like the game spore with unthinkable adaptations of beings. Hell you could even design your character to be an alien and not even human. \n\nI always thought it would be cool to actually fly the space ship and you can stop and dock at different aircrafts like space stations or something thst has bars, armory, general stores that you can visit while on a long trip. \n\nRPGs are always at their best when you can be whoever you want instead of always forced into the hero destiny that after a while is boring. Being able to work your way from a lowly crew member doing odd jobs across the universe could make you enough money to buy/build your own ship or even steal one somehow. \n\nIt would be awesome to have a fallout settlement type system where you can design a rest stop or colony or just a little hideout for your gang or crew if you find a cool spot on a random Planet to hide from authorities.\n\nYou could do roles like bounty hunters or be a hired gun to escort. Could be a scout for companies wanting to find land or resources on a untamed planet or area. \n\nI mean there are so many ways to go about it and so many shows or movies or other games to take inspirations from. I’m not a game designer at all and I just a lover of legit replay-able games.\n\nI’m so sorry thst this may be rambling but I am new to this sub plus I have so many ideas and just figured there has to be someone out there thst has the same thoughts.\n\nThanks everyone!"
hgd5d3,Kingdom MMORPG,"Imagine having a game where you pick roles so like. 2 roles I can think of right now would be like king and general. King advisor.etc as many jobs as you can think of right. Along an open world where other teams que and get placed into a kingdom in which you can name for the game being. Control parts of the map, the general and king could spawn soldiers in. Become allies with countries. Have war. But this would all be from a first person view not a tactical third person MObile based game. This would be for PC and extremely in depth RPG. Open your kingdom. Close your kingdom. Interact with the other players to secure your kingdom. Invade other lands. Defend against attacks. Deal with kingdom issues. A huge RP aspect would be applied and each role would have a lot of specific duties and interactions throughout the castle and kingdom. Being able to actually do these things would be pretty important. \nI just had a dream that’s actually how I got this idea. I had magic powers as the king. And I am able to control my dreams. We were getting invaded and I had to suspect that we have corruption in the kingdom we had to defend against attacks and stuff it was truly amazing and it would make a game of the year really. There’s nothing like this in the market."

hgaung,RTS style game but the player only controls a single builder/worker unit,"and that’s as far as that idea goes. I like the concept but can’t get any further than that. How would you make a game fun by taking control of a single builder/worker/gatherer unit and the rest of the world is done by the computer? should the player be able to choose where to build things or should that also be decided by the game as you are only a peasant after all? should the player’s only strategy be in deciding in what order to build, gather resources or assist the combat units in some other way? trying to flesh out my idea so that I can potentially create a game out of it"

hg8x2p,An RPG stat system.,"Hello. I would like to see the following system implemented in some game. The following is the Stat system of an RPG that is visually \n\nturn-based but occurs in real-time. i.e, the main hero casts skills/spells\n\nin real time and also attacks in real-time. Companions are automatic(automatic target, automatic casting). Only hero is manually\n\ncontrolled. It is a PVP game.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStrength - Increases physical damage(0.1 Physical damage per 1 point of Strength)\n\nDexterity - Increases comparative evasion chance. (Every 1 point of Dex more than opponent's Dex, increases evasion chance by 0.5%)\n\nAgility - Increases comparative attack speed. (Every 1 pt of Agility more than opponent's Agility, increases attack speed by 0.5%)\n\nWisdom - Increases Mana/Stamina pool and regen rate.\n\nMagic - Increases magic damage(0.1 Magic damage per 1 point of Magic)\n\nConstitution - Increases maximum HP(5 HP per 1 point of Con) and HP regen rate(0.15HP/sec per one point of Con).\n\nFocus: Each point of Focus increases Highest Stat by 0.5%.\n\nCharisma: Each point of Charisma increases HP and Damage of companions by 0.5%.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFurther Stat rules:\n\n	1. Every 25 points increase in any stat further provides 1 extra stat point for that stat.\n\n	2. Gears do not have a stat requirement. Gears have a level requirement.\n\n	3. No active combat skill can have a damage output of more than 500%. Maximum of 6 usable skills including a default skill.\n\n	4. The best mercenary has total stats approximately 33% of Main hero or less. Maximum of 3 mercenaries can be utilised.\n\n	5. Every level, hero gains 5 stat points.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNotes:\n\n	1. There is no point in allowing manual allocation of stat points if all the gears have stat requirements unless there is no\n\n	Class restriction for gears and the game drops gears that cater to all possible stats.\n\n	2. The above stat values consider the possibility that the hero is being attacked by 4 opponents. Con works well in one on one\n\n		fights.\n\n	3. The game also has multiplayer option where four members team fight occurs.\n\n	4. AOE skills and spells are constrained to attack the target and a random adjacent cell.\n\n	5. I would see this concept to include QWE &amp; ASD as the hot keys for skills/spells with an additional Hold C + QWE or ASD for the\n\n	secondary skills. The total usable skills in combat would hence be 12. Hence, this completely balances out the HP regen value of Con."

hg6x7l,A racing/crew management game,"**First things first**\n\nThis is my first post since the day i made my account, I apologize for inconsistency/whatever is wrong with this post, also English is not my first language so sorry for any grammatical errors, but this doesn't mean you need to be gentle ;)\n\n**The Idea (also you can mold this however you want)**\n\nThe could be a casual arcade racing game, but maybe simcade/simulator would sit better. Theme is illegal street racing. The management mechanics would implement onto your crew, you could send them to a race, train them , ride with them etc. Also you and your crew members could get injured/killed when you crash (depends on the crash) or maybe even arrested.\n\n**The Dream part (this is about how I would want the game to be)**\n\nFeel free to take inspiration from this part, but you can skip this.\n\nI would like the cars to be fully/extensively customizable (aesthetically/technically), and also to be real life models (a bit of a stretch). The crew would need to make money for maintenance, upgrades, repairing cars, medical bills, posting bail, bribing cops etc. and i think cool idea is that the player/members could have a day job (or whatever), and at night they would race. Maybe after some time you could make enough money to buy a tuning garage that would rake up money easily. Also maybe some safehouse/meeting point. At this point if You're reading this, I am just making stuff up as i write, so sorry if there's a lot of maybe/could be. I'm not sure about open world, but I think it would flow better. Also cars could be damaged to a point that they are not recoverable, and maybe if its an old model you cannot buy the parts for the car. \n\n**Credits**\n\nThis whole idea occurred to me when playing NFS Carbon.\n\nAlso i was inspired by these works: MGSV, NFS, Initial D, FlatOut, so if you see some resemblance now you know why. \n\nThank you for reading this mess, also ask freely if you want to know more of anything about this, and tell me if dislike/like this idea. Let the criticism flow!"
hg2tuo,perry the platypus: the video game,"perry the platypus: the video game would be about the character ""perry the platypus""  from the show Phineas and ferb, it would contain a mix of a 3D platformer and would contain a cell shaded art style, the game would be open world but you would travel to certain points in the map in order to get to various levels\n\nthe enemies would detect perry using a spotlight in whatever direction they look this would reflect onto walls for the player to see, perry can avoid this by holding down a certain key, button to disguise himself as a normal platypus, referencing the running joke in the show where doctor doofensmirtz cannout recognize perry if he's not wearing his 1940s fedora. \n\nthe platforming would use basic platforming mechanics as well as technology that would help him to platform provided by OWCA, these would include a parachute, some form of rocket boots to allow him to double jump, a grappling hook, a bullet time mechanic which could be used for platforming as well as stealth and eventually perrys iconic flying car\n\nas for the combat most of it would be stealth based. perry can switch between stealth mode and platforming mode. When in stealth mode the camera angle will switch to shiftlock mode, perry can obtain various gadgets to aid him in his quest like a stun gun, goggles which allow him to see enemies through walls, a freeze ray that can freeze enemies, grenades, a pistol like laser gun, his hat which can be tossed to both damage and distract enemies and many other weapons that I can't think of. \n\nthe story would consist of doctor doofensmirtz trapping all of the tri-state area into a virtual reality world that is so addicting nobody would want to get out so he can use a robot army and take over the tri-state area, OWCA's best agent (perry the playtpus) is sent to stop doofensmirtz by defeating his robots and taking down his various points of operation.\n\nAnd most importantly, yes this is partly a shitpost but also an idea me and a few other people I was talking to had that I thought might be cool so I decided to post it here for the redditors of reddit to see."

hfyy6r,MMO Horse Racing,"I know it seems straight forward in the title but just hear me out. Just a little background for the current state of where horse racing is as a genre. Imagine that no graphical enhancements have exceeded past 2010 and the only half way decent looking games are bland pay2win lootbox apps with very little depth for customization, breeding, stables, and racing AI. \n\nMy vision of the best horse racing game would be to take the statistic analysis and development part from ""Starters Orders 6"" and combined it with the beautiful graphics of Rockstar Games ""Red Dead Redemption 2."" \n\nNow that the base is set, the setting/story would be a modern day homestead where you start off as a stable hand and develop into a jockey and continue to progress and after so long you can retire and build your own stable and begin breeding yourself. However, I think it would be interesting to have an almost GTA crazy storyline inbeded into it for a ""ride of your life"" kind of feel. \n\nNow for the MMO part of the game would of course be separate from the main storyline. Just starting off as an owner with a set amount of funds and 1 randomly generated horse. You have an open world farm with upgradable equipment, buildings, staff, etc. The progression would be a slow pace development process moving along with real time. I think the competitive breeding and racing as an MMO would skyrocket the Horse racing genre scene and would have people all over trying to breed the perfect horse or win the triple crown. Horse auctions would be held on specific days and people bidding against one another in real time. When races that are happening in real life will be added as online events for that day with special prizes. \n\nAll that being said strictly no lootboxs, buy money, buy improvement, stamina limits, etc., just good old fashion grinding and making your way to the top. \n\nLet me know what you think or let me know if you have your own idea that would make for an amazing horse racing simulator."

In this world your money will be reset but everything else stays the same. And you start unboxing again until you hit the next threshold. The whole point of the game is the fun of clicker games and the addictiveness of lootboxes and mystery boxes but the difference is you donot have to pay money so people can enjoy the experience without grinding or paying just simultaneous unboxing."

For example a great idea for a level would be a volcanic ash version of Portland Oregon. It would be covered in pink sand and colorful volcanic auroras. It’s less of the bleak nature of the apocalypse and more the faith in the future. \n\nProgression: you must control every basic survival need to gain culture. Culture helps you advance in technologies, land, trading, rites, and more. A massive part of the game is inhabiting stores and buildings to gain a perk to get you more culture. For example if you inhabit a paint store you may paint your buildings for more culture a day. And you can customize the buildings however you like. \n\nYou gain more culture by inhabiting harder to manage places. So you chose your own difficulty. You can start building your city around a wrecked spaceship in the Everglades, a Japanese garden in a hotel or newly formed atolls.\n\nRites . At milestone intervals you will gain a card. There’s about 30 cards you get at random that allows for you to add the rites &amp; laws in your city. Nothing to deep to get you confused or lost. \nYou will get a topic and 2-4 unique solutions to benefit you at a small cost. Like dumping laws, transportation, and work pay. Be as strict as you want or as loose. \n\nOccupations and traders. Each person has a skill they excel at. One may get mold out of buildings faster for you to inhabit and another may be a stone mason. There’s a micro-strategy to use your citizens effectively. Another type of citizen is a trader, he leads the pact to trade with other tribes and cities. You gain random placable objects after a trade is complete. \n\nCollect cloth to build tents and place them in a tennis court. Build cities in steamy grottos and wrecked boats on the shore. Reopen florals, jewelry stores, and the veterinary. Place neon signs to increase your culture. write a law that only applies to eating a new alligator species. Build your fantasy on what was already built before. \n \n\n- Thankyou for reading my idea"
hft20t,4 player free for all top down shooter,"The twist is that every player starts with a different gun (say pistol, shotgun, machine gun and flame thrower) now when you kill someone you merge your own gun with theirs creating a new weapon.\nFor example you start with the shotgun and you kill the person with the machine gun, now you get a rapid fire shotgun or something like that, now you kill the person with the flamethrower and your bullet turn into fire bullets.\nThis idea definitely needs some work but I think it would be a fun game."
hft1fu,overlord -&gt; game,"have anybody seen the anime, Overlord.\n\nturning that into a game I think it would be awesome.\n\nthe game would be an MMORPG, but you would have to build and design your own base, the higher level you are, the bigger you can build it, and more structures would become available.\n\nthe game would also let you create factions and each faction could have a bigger base, depending on the number of members, maybe max 20, and each member would be able to design their own floor.\n\nit would also be possible for some characters, to make NPC´s (necromancer, druid, and others), where you would have to level each NPC up separately, and their level would independent of your own.\n\nmaybe even have some standard NPC´s for those who can´t make their own.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nother than that it would probably be a pretty normal MMORPG."

hf9r9x,Hunted down style game with multiple playable characters,"I’m not sure if a game is already out there that is similar to this concept, but overall I think it’d be a great idea!\n\nI want a game where you play as a group of friends or a gang or something that are being hunted down throughout the story. Somewhat like “the last of us” style, where you head through the game looting the world and following a main story; however, this time you play as the villains. \n\nWhat I see happening is, you start out the game with a group of people who might’ve killed somebody or started an event, then they all scatter. You go through the story with a difficult AI killing off each member of the group. Every time one of the characters gets killed off, you learn more about the hunters intention and switch to the next member of the group. \n\nI think there needs to be more of a market for games where it doesn’t have to end well. In this idea, I want it to end with all of your members dying off and ending with a grim message."
hf3cqz,Managing The Roman Empire as the Emperor | Strategy Game,"I know the concept of managing the Roman Empire is not really new. For example Total War : Rome. I have played a lot of those historic strategy games and over the time i kinda created my own ideas about it. My concept should not be too hard to realise, because it is more text-based and 2D. So there should be no difficulties with the graphics. The game is all about the content. So basically this game is not something: I wish that was something real, but more like: I wanna create that. So this concept is not something totally unrealistic. \n\nIn all of the strategy games I have played you manage your Empire not as an existing person in the game itself, but really as a ""god"": You can not die, you control mostly everything happening in the empire, and you can just see everything on the campaign card. \n\nI thought of an game, in which you actually play as the Emperor. You actually are in the game and do the everyday business of an Emperor. Of course I said, it is a 2D game, so you are not actually going to fight in battles or such. I have made a concept of a room, in which the emperor manages everything. \n\nThere is the campaign card, in which you can see your Empire. But not as in other games, you can not actually just click on a city and see all the stats of it. Historically accurate governors took care of citys or provinces in the empire, so you have to  assign politicians, nobleman or family members to those places. They are going to organise those cities and you can only send them messages in which you give orders. Those messages have to be delivered first and also can be intercepted by enemys. Those governos also can get corrupt so they do not follow your orders. You always have to check there work.\n\nSo I think you should get where I am going for. Basically a much more historically accurate strategy game. Also you feel much more immersed, like you actually were the emperor.\n\nOf course there is much more to the game, but I feel like this post would be way to long if I would explain the whole concept. So if there is any questions or criticism just go ahead.  (Also i am not sure which flair to give this post, if someone would suggest something?)"
hf0nnz,VR Creating Simulator Game,"I have an Idea for an VR creating Simulator game. Where u can create your own Company and create your own VR's, you can cooperate with other Studios or buy them. You can research better/new technology. If u create a VR you can choice how much you want to spend on diffrent factours. So like Resoultion, Hardware, Tracking and other stuff. If you want to spent in all Catergies much the Production Price gets higher but if u only spent a bit on other stuff and a lot on the Hardware the prodcution price will go down. You can still set for how much you want to sell the VR. \n\nMaybe you can even create your own Software for the VR. and i think ""steam"" VR Statstics should be in the game where u can see how many users on steam got your VR and how much users the other VR Studios  have gotten.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThats my Idea for a VR Simulator Game.

hf0ast,Open World Old Western Survival Game With Debt Based Main Objective,"\-Old West era survival game with emphasis on food, water, shelter, and combating sickness. \n\n\-Also has an economy and trading system with NPC's\n\n\-The only overarching goal is that your character has recently gone broke somehow after borrowing a large sum of money from a shady organized crime group. Perhaps you are a shady entrepreneur who's business failed after building it on the loan money.\n\n\-Player can accept typical western era frontier criminal and non-criminal jobs in town like lumberjack, cattle rustler, literal cowboy, town sheriff or at least a deputy, pony express type mail-man/mail-woman, ranch hand, even a cowboy action exhibition shooter like Annie Oakley \n\n\-Player can live nomadically as a hermit in the wilderness building makeshift shelters or living out of a wagon r cave, or purchase property and build there.\n\n\-Features hunting and human vs human combat using flintlocks and cap and ball revolvers on the low end all the way up to cartridge single shot rifles, breach loaded double barrel shotguns, lever actions, and cartridge revolvers in the expensive tier\n\n\-Emphasis on maintenance and cleaning of guns as preparation for combat and hunting. Older firearms can only be reasonably reloaded before and after combat and not during, adding additional planning and maintenance requirements.\n\n\-As long as the player owes his debt, outlaws from that organized crime group will occasionally come after them to create a consistent threat.\n\n\-Complexity of the game development depends entirely on the perspective and real time status of gameplay. This idea could be implement from something as light as a 2D, isometric turn based game all the way up to a first/third person real time 3D game."
hexwus,GTA-like game in a procedural generated city,"Hi, I have an idea an open-world game in a city environment but with using procedural generation, I think that randomly generated missions isn't really good idea here but there could be interactive buildings in the city like bank, gym, casino, bar etc where the player can find some activities, try to earn money, buy house and other non-scenario stuff. The main idea is that you have some kind of ""unique"" city every time and your city could have different set of buildings that changes currently gameplay."

hayryn,Dungeon crawler with card-based combat system,"I am going to make a game during this summer so I came up with an idea for a dungeon crawler-like game that takes place in a tower. Player is an adventurer whose main goal is to climb that tower. To do that he must find companions and fight with monsters on every floor. The trick is everything in the tower is represented by cards. Player instead of collecting equipment would collect cards containing items or skills.\n\nGameplay:\n\nPlayer will control party of 3 characters with one leader. His death means game over. Each character owns a deck with limited amount of cards (e.g. 30 cards). Each card can be used in battle as a skill or item. Cards can be dropped from enemies or found in chests. Battles are initiated by random encounters. After battle starts instead of having standard actions like items, attack, skill, etc. game will draw 5 cards.  Similar system can be found in Megaman Battle Network series. The tower itself will have finite number of floors. Most of those floors will be random generated but some of them will be predefined with a boss residing there (something like Tartarus from Persona 3). \n\nOptional features:\n\n* Some cards will be restricted to specific character class. \n* Characters other than leader will die permanently. New party members can be recruited while exploring floors.\n\nWhat do you think about it? Is it even worth trying?"

Maybe you could just leave Book out of the game entirely with only references to him or have an impersonator voice Book in a limited capacity.\n\nIdeally they could adapt the comic storylines that continue and end the story that Joss Whedon never got the chance to on Fox. \n\nThe first few missions could be a continuation of the climax of Serenity and then go on into the comics storylines and even some original stuff."

haah5i,"Imagine: A massive Retro Game collection game, with titles from the 70s to early 2000s, and remaster them. (This is a long one too).","Okay, I’m thinking of a game where it’s basically a collection of games. A huge one, dating from video games from the 70s to early 2000s. Retro games from series like Mario Bros, Sonic, Legend of Zelda, Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat (Maybe Bards tale?), and a lot more. Except all of these games are remastered to fit 2020 standards for gaming. Better graphics, and the such. And yes, I imagine there would be option to play in the games original graphic setting.\n\nOn the basis, I’m thinking two modes will be in this, Collection mode, and Story Mode. \n\nCollection mode means you can just jump straight into the games and play them yourself. Every game and every console will be unlocked (kind of) so you can play the games, in either a Remastered version of that classic, the original graphic setting the game came at launch and an improved retro graphics setting, where it still looks like the original graphic, but it has several improvements, like better and more smoother animations.\n\nStory mode is where you play as a child growing up during the 80s, and as you could expect, it features a story surrounding this kid. And it shows how much Video games mean to him and with this, it shows the magic that Video games can provide. I want it to be a story that’s not to long, but not to short either. And memorable. At the start of the story, you have two consoles to choose from, A Nintendo Entertainment System, or a Sega Genesis. Once you made your decision, you get one game, depending on the console. Now, as you start to play more and more of the game, you begin to age. And every so often you get some extra money, and you can purchase more games, or another console. As I said, you progress through the story until the kid is supposedly 30 or 40 or something. And at the end of the story, you unlock some new consoles and games that were previously locked in the Collection Mode.\n\nAs for DLC on the other hand, I was just thinking old games that weren’t featured in the Vanilla Game, and price them around $1 - $5. \n\nSo, what do you think?"

ha1d2o,PC Anime Card Game Idea,"Have you ever noticed that there are no Hearthstone-style games, gwent, Eternal etc. PC card games with anime like characters or anime style? In my opinion if there was a game in this version it would really sell a lot, they could even cooperate with real anime agencies and maybe make exclusive card packs for limited periods based on real anime series. I saw that a lot of android and iOS anime related games some time they cooperate with real anime agencies to make buyable real anime characters for limited time. In my opinion of a card game like Hearthstone in anime style existed It would be Extremely played, the fanbse is huge for this genre"
h9ylha,A medieval war game where you're a commander that sends orders out with a delay,"Imagine you're an elite commander for a kingdom at war with another nation, so you send out troops to slowly capture territory and take the enemies out. Since there aren't any walkie talkies or cellphones back then, all of your commands come out with a delay.\n\nThe delay will work so that the farther your soldiers are from you (a physical character in-game), the longer it takes for them to receive your commands. So the soldiers near you follow your commands completely, while the ones closer to enemy base (and farther from you) will have a substantial delay before acting on it.\n\nYou can reduce the inconvenience of delayed commands by having your character, the commander, move closer to the soldiers. It allows easier communication, but also makes you more vulnerable to enemy attack.\n\nFor this, my idea is that the commander can only send commands or move, he can't do both. If you move before a squadron received the message, the message is cancelled and that squadron won't do that order.\n\nImagine you went with your soldiers to charge the enemy base, then all of a sudden they unleashed an onslaught of bombs. Do you, the commander, run away immediately to save yourself (commander death is an automatic lose state), or do you order your troops to run away first, wait for all of them to move, then run away yourself? The former will endanger your men, but the latter jeopardizes you and the entire mission.\n\nWe can also extend the delayed commands mechanic to things like:\n\n -have tiny parts of the map as ""no man's land"", where soldiers can't receive commands, so they follow their last command until they've exited ""no man's land"""

h9jz7a,Relaxing exploration adventure,So basically you're an adventurer that finds a forgotten island with the main concept of the game being you exploring the island and it's strange residents filling up your journal.\n\nThis island is also closely connected with nature and so every action you make will affect the island in some way and the way animals and inhabitants act torwards you.\n\n I want this game to have a main focus on exploration with little to no violence/combat. Any other ideas to add to this?
h9jsj2,This actually doesn't exist yet and I've been waiting for it for ages.,"\nAnimal simulators are suprisingly popular. If you look in the appstore, multiple animal sims have 10 mio downloads. And those aren't even ""good"" ones, the entire gameplay existing of nothing but hunting other animals, leveling up, finding a mate and sometimes gathering things. There is Nothing else you can do, also when you play online.\n\nSo I think it's time for an animal sim that stands above all those half heartedly made ones (they literally all have the same gameplay &amp; controlls, just set in different ares with different animals)\n\nAnd I think it might be really successful Especially because Animal sims aren't exactly a trend that will be interesting for a while until it's not. It's a continuous interest of a certain group of mostly younger teenagers apparently.\nBut I actually imagine this game maybe appealing to a broader audience.\nAlso having graphics unlike the existing animal sim mobile games, and instead looking more like the Untitled Goose Game (or also, something like the animals in Mini Ninjas looked like!). \n\nSO, what I have in mind-\n\nAn animal sim not for a single species but a Huge variety of different playable animals (and possibly also humans? their greatest benefit could be to be have more diverse looking skins, and being able to use gadgets).\n\nDifferent animals should have different possible interactions with other animals, and different tasks to fulfill.\nFor example a wolf would be able to hunt a deer. The wolf will have the benefit of not having a big chance to be killed by a predator, but will have a big chance to die if he can't find prey to eat. A deer would be at a much greater risk to be killed by a wolf, but wouldn't have to worry about starving.\n\nI especially want also animals involved that will be more excluded from a predator-prey focus. Like frogs. Frogs or other small animals like mice would also bring the interesting aspect of size difference, being able to reach places that other animals can't.\n\nA big focus should of course lie on online gameplay. Finding friends to team up with should be beneficial, for some animals more than for others. I'd like this to be similar to how it is in the real world. Animals who live in packs will have an easier time playing together with other players, and solitary animals won't have much of a benefit or even a rivalry going on. \n\nOne thing that I love in the already existing animal sims is the quest of finding a mate and building a family. I'd definitely want this also in this game. Again I think there should be differences between different animals based on how it works in the real world. Many animals might just need to find a mate for a one time meeting, but the female will raise the kids into adulthood (after which they head off alone and stop existing in the game), so there'd also be different quests for male and female. Also it would be cool if mating were possible with other players instead of npcs. If it's an animal where the male stays in the companionship of the female but you mated with another player, then an idea of solving the problem of your mate not being online every time that you are, would be to have an npc with the same skin as the player, be present any time that the player isn't.\n\nThe map should have different locations, being ideal habitats for some animals and less ideal for others.\n\nGameplay should mainly revolve around staying alive, whatever that includes doing for each playable species, reproduction, exploration, and teamplay (holding various benefits for most species, but not being necessary since a single player modus should of course be just as enjoyable). \n\nAnd one Very interesting aspect would of course be interaction between Different species that is Not food chain related. On the negative side rivalry. On the positive side, players of different species teaming up!! I can see a mouse and fox player exploring the area together, or a wolf protecting his sheep friend while the sheep lures other unsuspecting sheep towards his wolf friend.\n\nK so that would be a summary of what I have in mind rn. I'd just love for a proper animal simulator, that lets people play together as different animals, to exist. If anyone knows how I could find people who would enjoy working on this, please let me know! I'd love to lead the design, and work together on developing a detailed concept for the gameplay and mechanics. But, I cannot program one bit. I am also not looking to employ people to develop this game For me, I'd rather have people be genuinely interested in doing this together with me, everyone eventually getting their share of income once the game is selling/earning through ads as a mobile game. That being very little for myself, I am aware, since I can't do any of the actual programming work.\n\nAnyway and lastly a list of animals that I'd love to have in the game: wolf, fox, rabbit, deer, mouse, frog, opossum, raccoon, boar, bear, duck (, and other flying animals like bat, owl.. or not &amp; duck cannot fly high), otter \n- for a forest, hills &amp; pond environment for example.\n\nThat could be all there is at first, but more areas and animals could be added to the game in the following months or years after it's published. Like expanding the hills and adding a village - to have more playable animals like horses humans sheep cats dogs...\n\nOf course building an even bigger world to have environments for lions or elephants or monkeys would be cool. but i know that's far too much to wish for lol"
h9jdzp,Help me complete a game idea I have!,"Here is my story line:\n\nA five year old kid just witnessed the death of his parents from coronavirus.

His little brother two years older than him wandered out the door when he wasn’t looking, and is nowhere to be found. He needs to find his brother and bring his brother to safety in the chaos of the world.\n\nSo I want the rest of the game to be obstacles that hinder him from finding his little brother.

h9j3yp,F-Zero like game/ Redline game,"Since Nintendo's being biotch and not giving us a new F-Zero I've been thinking about making a game like it. Basically what I enjoy from the game is the super-fast pace aspect. Like you're going so fast one small mistake could launch you back to last. I think having total customization to not only the look but mechanics and devices of your car would be sweet. You could focus more on speed, or maybe you think loading up on weapons if the best way to win, or maybe you just wanna drive a cool ass car; all the customization is based on the money you earn from what place you got in races (NO LOOT BOXES). In order for this idea to be actually good, you could start in low-level races and work your way up in online so you don't get wrecked. The courses would have to be huge though. Obviously it has to have the futuristic/ comic-book style F-Zero has. Another cool thing is if you could make your car go on the water in water levels to get away from other players or if the tracks in the sky you could have customization that lets you fly off the track."
h9hkmv,The Last Week: story game,"This is a story game. The game’s about a 12 year old fox named Ethan. He moves out of his little town to the big city, because his father needs to be there for work (still work in progress). He leaves all his friends behind in the progress.\n\nWhen the father 4 years after moving suddenly dies, the family decides to move to their old small town. They arrive at the start of the summer. After 5 weeks of only playing games, he decides to meet up with his friends again, to regain them as friends. He has only one week to do so, seeing that the school starts after.\n\nThe core mechanic of the game is about you, playing as Ethan, choosing which friend you want to meet up with. You can meet up with a single friend max 3 times, and after that, you’re forced to choose another one. How many friends can be chosen later. During these meetups you start to get to know them on a deeper level, and you start to learn more about Ethan and his feelings.\n\nThis is just an idea. A lot of work still needs to be put into it."

h9ghst,Slayer,a funny silly weird halo like game \n\nI had this dream where I was a Spartan that woke up on a train one of my friends was there but a lot of others weren't but then the leader/conducted who sounded like an obnoxious teen said my friend couldn't go do he erased his spot on the train soon later my friend faded away. once we got off the train we got on to a futuristic elevater tower thingy in the middle of nowhere once we were at the top we were in a big room with stairs and two more floors along with a few other rooms we just started doing random stuff (you can put side missions) while we waited for the leader dude let's call him Simon . while we waited for Simon to tell us what to do next. then eventually we all got bored and started shooting at each other Simon joined in and said that the last 12 out of 89 people alive will get to go to the mission that involves a city that was in view of a window\nso we all started shooting untill it was me 11 others and Simon he told us we were sopposed to jump off a cliff into a cave once we were in the cave we found some aliens and stared attacking than Simon told us all to take out the alien power generator that was powering the city. we fought our way through a cave and then a field then we found a building with alien tanks inside and one big alien was commanding the aliens that were coming at us I killed him and then destroyed the generator immediately after I got a flash back of an Xbox 360 game called Slayer that had the exact same plot immediately after I woke up of course Slayer isn't a real game but I hope a game developer utilizes the story of my dream.
h9d7fw,Diablo/DungeonSiege-like RPG with StarTrek-like setting,"The idea is to take Dungeon Siege and convert it into a  StarTrek-like game where your ""base"" is your ship, and you play as a crew of 1-4 who land on different planets to do quests. 3 fighting classes: Sword-like Tech-weapons, guns (bullet and laser stuff) and some sort of ""magic"", whereass all the magic is done with future tech. I think of lightning rays, shrink beams and so on.\n\nA lot of potential for different settings and monsters"

h96oag,"Need some help with mechanic for ""static"" Roguelike","I am building a simple game. The idea is about the hero being in the center of the screen and the enemies walking around him, across the edges of the screen.\nThey can't attack you.\n\nThe hero can only shoot in a straight line towards the top of the screen, to the right, down or left. So in order to be able to hit an enemy, you have to wait for him to reach the center so it's aligned with you.\n\nWhenever you shoot, the hero turns 90 degrees to the right. So if he's facing up and you make him shoot, he shoots and turns to his right to face the right-hand side of the screen.\n\nThere are three types of enemies in the game, and at any point in time you have to kill one type, indicated above in the HUD. If you kill the right type, you get two points of energy, if you miss you lose one point of energy, if you kill the wrong type, you lose two points of energy.\nAfter you kill the right type, the game shows the next type of enemy you have to kill.\n\nWhen you kill all enemies on the screen, a new wave appears, with a greater number of enemies this time.\n\nYour goal is for your energy to never get depleted, otherwise you lose.\n\nEvery time you shoot you spend one unit of energy. Every two seconds that go by, your energy goes down by one.\n\nSo it's basically a game in which you shoot and when you do so you ""move"" (or rotate actually) and you have to administer your energy properly, killing the right type of enemy.\n\nAny additional ideas? Challenges? I was trying to make the enemies move faster as you make progress on the waves, but that doesn't change things much, and actually it might actually be easier for the player if enemies move faster since they can get aligned with you, without you having to wait too much time and losing energy.\nSo... anything else?"

h8x51q,This is an idea I made for GTA 6 Online but you can use it to make your own game also.,"Here is an idea for GTA 6 Online:\n\nEDIT: I made this exclusively for GTA Online so some changes can be done if you don't have the budget or knowledge to implement all the features\n\n(AI cops would be disabled in Online)\n\n1. At the start you can choose to be a good guy (Cop/Military/SWAT) or the bad guy (Normal GTA Online character).\n\n2. You get different missions when you are the good guy and when you are the bad guy. For example, raiding a drug dealers house when you are a good guy and defending the house from the cops when you are a bad guy.\n\n3. You get different equipment at the start of the game. For example, the good guy gets a free bulletproof vest, a police/military/swat uniform, a civilian uniform and a tazer and the bad guy gets a free handgun, outfit, lockpicking equipment (to steal cars or steal from cash registers etc.)\n\n4. Some guns or equipment is harder or more expensive to obtain for bad guys. (So that they don't go and shoot rocket launchers and 50 cal machine guns around the lobby) Also, guns should be limited to primary and secondary so that people can't just go around carrying 4 different rpgs, 6 machine guns etc. and you can store some guns in your safehouse or car.\n\n5. To limit crime commited by good guys they should have some kind of punishment if they accidentaly or intentionally kill or injure a civilian or a bad guy that is not doing any crime or threatening them (Maybe something like a bad sport lobby or having his gun and uniform taken away for some time)\n\n6. If a good guy takes down a bad guy who commited a crime all good guys nearby get money or xp and the bad guy gets money or xp taken away and vice versa. If a bad guy decides to surrender he doesn't lose any money or xp and the good guy gets even more money and xp then he would if he killed the bad guy (So that they can communicate with him instead of shooting him right away).\n\n7. When a bad guy commits a crime that a civilian saw or if he triggers an alarm all good guys in the lobby get a notification of the location and type of crime commited. Also if there is no civilians in the area a good guy can send a notification to others.\n\nI expect 10% off all profits from the game if you decide to make it.\n\nLol jk on that last part but seriously this is the first game that I would make if I had the knowledge and budget."
h8vkkd,Entirely 2nd person game,"I'm aware of games that have 2nd person aspects to them, like Driver San Francisco's one mission, but to my knowledge there haven't really been any games locked in someone else's view of your character. I thought of an idea how a 2nd person viewpoint could work for an entire game. The concept is you're character is a thief, but you can only see what the guards, cctv, and other security measures would see of the building your character is breaking into. Therefore your character would essentially be controlled off screen since what your looking at would be the people/objects trying to catch your character. Cutscenes could be press releases or news coverage of what your character did, or someone looking at you that's giving you a job. Not sure how you could sell a game like this since it would be so different, but an interesting concept for sure."
h8u1iw,Toshineko Hirozaki: Evil Genius.,"I was thinking of a game where you play as an evil military genius wanting to take over the world. Basically, you play as Toshineko Hirozaki, my villain OC, and the game will be a strategy game where you assume a role of a leader of the Toshineko Army.  \n\n\nYou'll come up with all sorts of military tactics, persuade, or inspire your men with speeches and your oratory skills, or manipulate your enemies. You will also have to use some strategic thinking to try and come up with a clever or genius plan to win the war.  \n\n\nThe idea is that it forces you to plan ahead and to figure out what your enemies strengths and weaknesses are.  \n\n\nWorld set that I thought of:  \n\n\nA real-life world except with anthropomorphic animals, where the game is set in 2023.  \n\n\nTell me what you think. :)"
h8svok,A virtual reality game like Blade and Sorcery,"My original thought would be playing as a tall powerful creature (like SCP 096) where you could rip off limbs, run after small 6 foot people while you play as the tall skinny monstrous SCP 096.

h8pamx,Realistic military game with aliens,"I just woke up and I had this dream:\n\nI was a rookie US Army Private stationed in an unidentified middle eastern city. There was a local militia with AKs, but we where on the same side because the city was under attack by really hard-to-kill aliens.\nWe had some trouble with a big tank-like enemy, so my squad leader told me to go get the AT rocket launcher that the militia had stashed in a nearby minaret. So I moved towards the objective, stealthily avoided some enemies, killed some smaller ones with my rifle. When I get to the objective there is this slow brute melee enemy who spots me so I kite around but cannot get rid of it.\nAnyway, it all ended with my unit coming to help and my leader calling in a drone strike on the brute so we could get to the AT launcher stash.\n\nSo I woke up and - as the milsim fan I am - thought that would make a cool setting for a game. I am imagining a mix of Arma/Squad military realism and Halo enemies.  \nIm thinking maybe a large scale 50 player PvE game. Players will fill squad slots with different roles like in Squad. Both on US side and the local militia. They communicate with other squads via in-game voice and radio simulation.  \nThe goal is simply to liberate this large middle-eastern town/city map. Block by block.  \nTo do that you need to somehow get better and better equipment/support. Maybe each sector of the town you liberate unlock better gear.  \n\nIf you wanna go really wild you would add logistic roles and fortification building and destructive environment.  \n\n\nIm guessing developing something like this would be a pain in the ass though, if it's anything like scripting missions in Arma 2 and 3, which is my only knowledge in ""game development"".\n\nThanks for reading anyway. Hope someone found it interesting or could pull a new cool idea from it. Cheers."
h8mqny,A 2D pixel art game where you are infected by a unknown darkness that slowly takes over as you progress,"I am indie developer, and mostly work on 3d stuff, I am decent at 2d pixel art though. I came up with this idea: You are a man with a dark past, coming home from the US Military, you were working on something top secret (without going into full detail). Over some time you start feeling sick, and have these awful cannibalistic thoughts. Worryingly you seek out help from the US Military, seemingly they try to help you, but once you realize they aren’t trying to help you and instead are trying to weaponize you, you freak out unleashing unthinkable power killing ever single person in the secret bunker, even the people who you once cared about, this is when you get your first taste of flesh. You escape the bunker to realize your power has seemed to vanish, making your traversing difficult as you go through the desert. As you progress you become greater at mastering these new found abilities.\n\nThis is just a rough draft! Would love for some ideas to implement!"

Say there are multiple CI groups that could plan attacks on facilities or maybe even time when the breaches are going to happen then you would send the MTF in. \n\nThe D-Class would be new players starting the game.

h85z49,Some small thought-out (1-3 weeks) game ideas,"Since a lot of the ideas here are not that well thought-out (mostly genre + look of the main character + some story) i thought i would post some ideas with actual features, game mechanics and scoring systems that should still be fairly easy to make.\n\nIf you actually create a game, feel free to post a video in the comments or send me a message, I would love to see one being made.\n\nHave fun:\n\n# Planet crusher (singleplayer PC, mobile, web):\n\nyou are a planet in the middle of the screen. Other planets are randomly coming from each direction. You have to draw circles around them to let them explode before they collide with your planet.\n\nDrawing lines costs energy. Your energy refills over time and when destroying planets. The more planets you destroy in one circle, the more points you get for each of them.\n\n**Gamemode A:** endless mode, planets fly faster over time, see how far you can get/how many points\n\n**Gamemode B:** Waves/Levels where you can buy upgrades inbetween\n\n**Upgrades**: max energy, refill rate, bigger line, longer slowmotio, slower planets, an energy shield for your planet that can take 1 extra hit.\n\n**Optional features:** \n\n\-slow motion while holding spacebar/tapping with second finger. Refills only if you destroy multiple planets at once\n\n\-Upgrades can randomly appear on screen\n\n\-special planets can randomly appear that increase the points of all planets that are destroyed together with it\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Lovers (local 2Players PC, web, console)\n\n2 players (wasd and arrow controls) are controlling two hearts that are connected with a bond. The screen is scrolling (vertically or horizontally doesnt matter) and new obstacles appear. Maybe saws, or little monsters that represent bad feelings for a relationship (anger, spite, doubt...)\n\nThe hearts and their bond must not touch those obstacles.\n\nThe bond has a minimum and maximum distance (so they cant just stack on top of each other). Also there have to be some fast moving obstacles at a right angle to the screen movement, so the players cant just form a straight line in the direction the screen is moving.\n\nAs with every autoscroller your upgrade options are limited. Maybe some gold coins could spawn and the players can buy new playermodels that increase the score or gold collected. Some might even give bonusses according to the other player. For example green player gives 50% extra coins when playing with yellow and 30% extra score when playing with purple. I think you get the idea.\n\n**Obstacle ideas:**  \n\-moving obstacles in predictable patterns\n\n\-monsters that must not hit player A but player B can destroy them. These can even be barriers accross the whole screen so player A must be infront of player B or vice versa\n\n\-obstacles appearing behind the players and blocking 10-30% of the screen for some seconds. This forces the players to move closer to the other side where obstacles appear thus making those seconds extremly difficult\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Apple maniac (local multiplayer PC, web, console)\n\n2-4 players move on a small 2.5D plane with a big basket. Behind them are huge apple trees where apples randomly fall down. Every player tries to collect as many apples as possible. They collide with each other and can slowly push each other around (animal crossing style).\n\nEach player has 1 shock charge. Players can shock each other when they are close to another consuming 1 shock charge. This disables the shocked player for x seconds but in turn gives him a new shock charge.\n\nFalling apples can also be spoiled. Collecting one of those will remove 1 point. During the game some events may happen. Apple rain, spoiled apple rain, normal rain and earthquake.\n\n**Apple rain and spoiled apple rain** should be self explanatory. These two exist, so that shocks can be  strategically important. Shock someone during the spoiled apple rain and they might catch 1-2 spoiled apples. Or save multiple charges to shock players during a good apple rain and collect all the apples for yourself.\n\n**Normal rain** makes players wet. While wet shocking another player will also shock yourself but still consume your charge and grant one to the shocked player.\n\n**Earthquake** causes a short screen shake and randomly swaps all players positions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Gravity (singleplayer pc, web, console, mobile)\n\nA one screen 2D platformer where spheres appear in the sky and fall down to the ground.  The player must dodge those spheres, the game is over if he gets hit. They shatter upon collision and leave behind multiple shards. The player must collect those shards to get points. \n\nIf there are still shards on the ground when the next sphere appears, it will suck those sphere in and grow bigger. Bigger spheres fall down faster and drop all consumed shards.\n\n**Additional features:** \n\n\-**The platforms have 2 sides:** White and black. They randomly flip during the game, some time the black side is top and white bottom, some time the other way around. The player can jump/fall through the white sides and stand on/get blocked by the black sides. The spheres also spawn in different colors. Black spheres only collide if the black side is on top, white spheres only collide if the white side on top. However both still collide with the ground.\n\n\-**Power-ups:** They spawn either far to the left or far to the right (to promote player movement) that increase his movement speed, collect all current shards on the ground, or stop the platforms from flipping for a short period of time.\n\nI already made this game, some **tips to juice it up**: \n\n\-screen shake on impact which gets more intense the bigger the sphere. \n\n\-Make shards leave behind trails when moving. \n\n\-Let shards fly in a random arc to the sphere when sucked in (bezier curve for example) and let the sphere make a small ""pulse"" or ""bump"" every time a shard makes it grow bigger.\n\n\-increase the odds of spheres spawning on top or close to the player. I found that equal distribution lead to the player just standing in the bottom left corner and being able to dodge nearly all spheres until they  grew reaaally big. Then he could just run accros the screen when a big one fell down easily collecting all shards at once."

h81lz0,"Games of hundreds of players on the same screen in 2d where players light up brighter if there exists a path of other players between them and some distant power source else they are darker, and depending on lighter/darker a player can move faster or slower","players vary in brightness based on where other players are, so basically if you cooperate with other players in your movements to have at least 1 continuous path of players from some power source to yourself then you can move faster, else you become slower until you reconnect.\n\nCould be variants of this like 3 teams of players like rock paper scissors each able to eat/attack/consume 1 other team and oppositely vulnerable to the other team, but hopefully it would be fun without dividing it into teams, more of an artistic flowing go wherever you want kind of thing, with a slight motivation to form into dense paths of where others are already moving."
h81fno,Low key comic heroes,"The game would be borderline reality. Heroes would be less about punching villains in the face and calling the job done as making social change. Possibly more dealing with bad policing of protests or cutting off people people pretending to be protesters from spoiling events. There would be continual action, as a character doing the bookwork isn't that great (but would be included in small vignettes), but mostly low key action. Powers come from gadgets and for monied characters, ability to spend on things, rather than actual super powers. Possibly some normal attributes like will power or strength might have peak moments that can happen, that verge on being briefly super powered. In some respects it'll be like old comic characters, before power levels increased in a dragon ball sort of way. Part of the thrill of play wont be escapism but instead thinking how close the situation is to a plausible reality."
h7z6j7,My idea is inspired by good-feel games like yoshi's woolly world and kirby's epic yarn as in it would be made of craft materials,"I'm open to more ideas to expand my idea\n\nalso as in made of crafts i mean just implied it doesn't have to be really cool like the good feel games like the sun is a light bulb and the clouds are just patches, in my concept art I drew it as pixel art and the patterns I made to look like home made materials\n\nI have this idea where one of my original characters has to save his roommate, (kinda dumb) but the thing is is that his alien species has no arms and is just a ball with stubby legs which is just a little quirk which would just be a fun animation difference in cut scenes if any.\n\nIt could be a level based game with a side scrolling 3D levels each with 3-5 collectibles or gems in each level and you have to unlock every 3rd level or so with the amount of collectibles required increasing each time.\n\nThe combat style would be in the over-world (not in turn based battle) in which you attack by rolling forward dealing damage to enemies in your way. The boss battles would be unique and not just over sized enemies.\n\nthe story would e as I said about rescuing the main character's roommate, Aster. All the NPCs would be from different made up species, yes I have made too many designs for them, they'd all be pretty similar within a species, with just little color change or a hat to make each at least a little memorable\n\nSpecies I've made so far\n\n\-Blublubs; the main character is one, they are just orbs with eyes and legs\n\n\-Co0Ws; quadruped sea cow faced turtle with a platypus tail\n\n\-Mupdle; basically ostriches with bald eagle heads and big eyes\n\n\-Dizzibei; aster is one, they are Sasquatch-like guys with barely any torso and gigantic feet, small face and hands\n\n\-Huffluffle; bowling pin looking guys with faces on the lower part of the pin, they crouch down and spring upward to move"
h7xmwi,"Full clip, XCOM like turn based game based on this single gimmick.","Recently I have been recording sounds for guns. The one thing that amazed me was how quickly the full magazine would be emptied. Even a 9mm handgun takes less than a minute.\n\nThis got me thinking about how annoying it is when in XCOM you miss a hit at 99%. A large part of that is because every hit counts, so missing a almost guaranteed hit is painful. But does it need to be when guns can be fired so fast?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe theme could be some kind of gang war.\n\nA bunch of untrained fighters just using the spray and pray tactic. The player could hold down and target multiple targets, but once the attack starts all the ammo in the current clip will be spend.\n\nThe amount of times a character can attack depends on how many ammo clips they carry.\n\nLoot corpses and ammo crates is how players can get more attacks.\n\nEven if the player misses 10% of the shots it isn't as bad as it would be in a XCOM game, because that would just be 10% less damage; instead of a missed attack.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBecause the game will depend heavily on weapons it will probably make a good mobile game. That is it, this is just a quick idea I had. If someone wants they can make something from this."

Or you can do an action with the orb\n* Orb mechanics:\n   * Orb consumes 1 energy per turn while it's turned on\n   * when it's turned on, it lights up the environment, allowing you to see around but also nearby enemies will be attracted to you and walk towards you in the next and subsequent turns\n   * when orb is turned off, enemies can't see you, but enemies that have already spotted you will remember your position and continue walking towards you\n   * you can throw the orb to hit an enemy. It will only deal damage if it's on. When hitting an enemy, it will kill it if it has same or more energy than the enemy's HP.\n   * it can only be turned off when you are holding it (or if you're not holding it and runs out of energy)\n   * it will recharge 1 energy per turn when it is turned off but only when you're holding it\n   * if you were spotted by enemies, you can throw it while it's on, to distract enemies that will go towards it\n   * you can use it as a bomb remotely: throw it in one turn, and trigger it at a distance in the next one, to damage any enemies close to it (using it as a bomb consumes a good deal of energy)\n   * you can teleport to it (consumes a bit less energy than using it as a bomb)"

New locations, agents and new gear for the Vigilante to use can be unlocked per mission completed. \n\nHow the player solves each mission affects the livelihoods of the people around, and in turn, affects how easy/difficult it is to maintain agent's covers. You can recruit new agents using the ones you have to ""make contact"" with them."
h7kcbc,Maze Runner inspired team survival game,"It would be cool to have a game based on the Maze Runner films, using large, procedurally generated mazes to ensure a unique play through each time.\n\nThis game would focus heavily on team cooperation and communication to survive.\n\nPlayers spawn in a central point with tools, survival kits, food, etc. You have to explore the maze and locate an exit, whilst avoiding various hazards and traps within the maze. Some players would have to farm food, breed animals for slaughter, build a base, smith weapons, etc. \n\nPowerful monsters inhabit the maze and have to be researched and taken down or distracted in various ways. Each monster has weaknesses that are not evident at first and can drop highly valuable resources.\n\nPlayers can level their skills in combat, agriculture, technology and crafting, etc. Crops can be grown and farmed for use in food, medicine or crafting. Each player can only specialise in a few skills, meaning you need to further cooperate to ensure survival. \n\nHigher crafting levels would be required to allow you to create better weapons, tools and better technology. You would also be able to craft larger backpacks, better running gear and more to aid you with your escape.\n\nCertain resources must be scavenged from within the maze and certain equipment can only be made using the alien technology acquired from the dead bodies of the unknown monsters inhabiting the maze. \n\nRunners would have to scout the maze using their high levels of stamina, and a blank canvas of paper would be used to document the route back at the base. Though, runners have lower health so would need to be accompanied by gunners to ensure their safety. Health lost may be replenished by medics, though certain poisons or diseases would require cures made from resources obtained in the world.\n\nUpon death, players would be spawned back at the original base and must wait a certain amount of time before being able to contribute to the team again. They would also drop all their equipment and resources at the location of their death. If players leave the game, others may join in their place, but will spawn with no skills or resources. However, if they retrieve the beacon of the dead player, they will gain their knowledge, but this is risky as you don’t always know what caused the death of the player. \n\nThe maze could also have locations where the walls shift location to add another dynamic to the experience. Some areas have toxic gas that can only be navigated with gas masks. Others, extremely dark and require illuminating equipment. \n\nI think this would be a great cooperative experience, relying mainly on communication between players to ensure escape. Players can earn cosmetic clothing, gear and titles based on what skill trees they frequent.\n\nThis could also work in an alien planet environment, where players must explore this strange and unknown planet to find a way to escape. \n\nI would like to make this game, but it would be a huge project that would take me a long time. \n\nAny more ideas to add to this are encouraged and may motivate me to make a simplified version. Thanks for reading!"
h7k3uf,Need ideas for a game.,"I'm thinking of making my first complete game and I need some ideas for it from the gaming community, keep in mind **the game will be short** since I want to make it in 14 days (**platform pc**).\n\nThe ideas I need are:\n\nA concept\n\nCharacters\n\nGame modes\n\nAnd whatever comes through your mind, leave it below :)\n\n**I'm pretty experienced.**"
h7fmg5,AAA - Colony 1-person creation,"The game idea might seem simple but it would be complex to make. Anyway here goes:\n\nThe main idea is that you play somebody who are sent ahead of a colony spaceship with the goal of building the infrastructure of the new colony. There is only so much a probe can do. You will land on the designated area for the colony and find the perfect spot in that region to build the colony. You will have to use the resources and forfill the request of the colony ( how many houses, an administration building, hospital, factories etc) as well as explore the region so the colonists will know what they are getting themselves into.  You have to build droids to help you. \n\nThe main difference here is that its all 1 person view and its not combat oriented The better you do the better your reward will be. Maybe the reward is to settle here and your working to afford building your own dream house. \n\nThe sandbox game should also  include underwater areas as well as caves and land.  There should be unique nature and animal life and part of the job would be to categorized them. \n\nThe difficulty should be the timelimit and resources available.\n\nMost games has monster and focus on some mystery to solve. I kinda just want to explore and build cool bases. Maybe toss in a few mysteries but I don't want it to be the focus. And I want to walk around the base so no 3 person or top down view."
h7eoh2,The Ultimate Ghost Recon game (or what Breakpoint could have been),"This post is going to be quite extensive, but I thought this out quite a fair a bit and thought it was worth sharing. \n\nSo I recently picked up and played Ghost Recon Breakpoint since they've fixed it up quite a bit since release making it the tactical shooter it probably should have been from the start. As much as I enjoyed it however, it did leave A LOT to be desired, both in terms of the game play and the overall setting. Here's my idea for what would make an awesome Ghost Recon game or any open world tactical shooter. \n\n# Setting:\n\nThe biggest issue I had with Breakpoint was the setting that the players are put in feels very uninspired and kind of nonsensical. I'm not talking about the location, in fact the island that you play on (Auroa) is actually kind of cool, with fairly diverse terrain. Instead I'm talking about the overall situation of it being an island owned by some tech company that gets overtaken by a paramilitary group with super-high tech drones. Tom Clancy is generally known for its fictional but believable conflicts/scenarios and this just felt really out of place. \n\nMy Idea would be set in contemporary times (no drone swarms or super high tech drones in general) in a country with an on going civil war, involving various internal factions as well as foreign powers fighting in the conflict. It would probably be best to set it somewhere in Central Asia, Central/South Africa or Central/South America in order to allow for a more diverse map. There would be some civil conflict going on, involving friendly, neutral and an enemy faction or factions which I'll come on to later on. The game would also obviously have civil populations living in towns, villages and cities that could be both within the territories of certain factions or in unclaimed areas. This would make the world feel much more alive and actually feel lived in. Breakpoint did have civilians but they were so scarce it made the world feel so empty besides the enemies roaming around. \n\nYou as the player a part of the Ghost Recon team would be sent in this open setting to conduct direct action, asymmetric warfare, counter-insurgency operations on behalf of the US, also fighting along with the local factions. \n\nI think this would be a much more realistic setting that would allow for a variety of terrain types (deserts, jungles, forests, plains) and much more interesting factions with their own goals that are separate to yours. \n\n# Factions and Participants:\n\nNow to populate this world, its gonna need the factions I talked about, and a dynamic faction system similar to games like Mercenaries games would be pretty cool allowing you to influence the overall conflict and even the ending of the game. \n\n**Friendly Factions:**\n\n1. US (Faction you play for): due to this being a game taking place in a civil conflict, this faction would probably be the least apparent in the game since you would be its representative in it, although it would be cool to come across other units in this faction on the map doing their own thing. \n2. US Backed Rebels: This would be the main friendly faction, they would populate much of the world fighting the other groups, and you would do most of the main game missions for them, fighting along side them.\n3. US allys: here we would have friendly nations also taking part in the conflict, maybe the UK or any NATO countries, you would do missions with them sometimes or come across their units in skirmishes etc. \n\n**Neutral/Dynamic Factions:**\n\nI don't really know what would go here, it would depend on the exact setting/conflict, but it could be other rebel groups that are also fighting the enemy factions but with their own ideologies or strategic goals that are separate to the friendly ones. Having multiple of these factions would be necessary so that helping one might anger the other and vice versa, allowing the campaign to be more dynamic. It would be even cooler if helping one enough would ally them, making them friendlies, and angering other neutral factions enough could push them to permanently siding with the enemies. \n\nAlso there would be civilians roaming the map and populating the towns, obviously this is kinda self-explanatory. Killing these people would probably just result in a game over or maybe negatively impact your faction standing.  \n\n**Enemy Factions:**\n\n1. Government forces: this would be the other side of the civil war that the friendly rebels would be fighting. They would populate much of the world map too with conventional forces such as regular infantry and land/air vehicles such as tanks, helicopters and aircraft (probably Cold War era stuff). They would be backed by the a foreign power too much like the rebels. \n2. Foreign power: here we would have the counter to the US in this proxy war. You wouldn't see these guys much since they won't field any conventional forces on the map but maybe you could come across their special forces which would be much harder to fight, and their equipment would be much more modern. Aircraft from this faction would probably also be present in this conflict. I guess the generic choice would be Russia and China (which I don't really mind tbh) but any country could go here as long as its plausible. \n3. Enemy rebels/paramilitary: this would just serve as a weak faction that sides with the government forces. They'll engage you or your allies in hit and run tactics and really only be using things like technicals.\n\n# Gameplay:\n\n**Gunplay and Movement:** So in terms of gameplay, for it to be a tactical shooter, it needs some level of realism, not to the extent of a game like ARMA but something similar to Ghost Recon Breakpoint would be fit quite well. One thing I would like to see would be the movement/stamina system from Breakpoint that it so you couldn't just sprint up and down hills without falling over and tumbling, since this really adds to the tension of combat in mountainous/hilly terrain. Anything from realistic movement, slow healing and tactical gun play would to make it so you would have to engage in combat in a more methodical manner would be needed. \n\nAn easy to use squad-command system would also be needed to direct AI teammates (or online players in co-op) would be required too. \n\n**AI:** In order to make the combat fun, obviously good AI is needed for both friendlies and enemies. Expect enemies to flank, heal each other and choosing to assault or retreat would make the combat feel dynamic. Additionally friendly AI needs to be good too especially for the squad-mates so that combined with the good enemy AI, the squad-command system would feel both required and viable to use in combat. It would be awesome if friendly faction forces would sometimes act independently of you, maybe haphazardly charging the enemies, forcing you to adapt to the situation so that they don't all die. \n\n**Support Assets:** Being apart of the US faction, you should be able to call in support. Maybe you could drop smoke for supplies/vehicles, or using laser designators/GPS to call in strafing runs, artillery, helicopter gunship support. However the enemy factions, especially the government faction or foreign powers should have access to these too, calling them on you or your allies during battles. \n\n**Customization and Gear:** This game should have an extensive selection of equipment to choose from, however unlike Ghost Recon, they should serve a bigger purpose than just being cosmetic. Maybe different camos will allow you to blend in better when trying to stealth (like in MGS), or choosing between shirts/jackets will allow you to perform better depending on whether you are fighting in a hot or cold environment. There should obviously be a large variety of weapons with extensive customization. \n\n**Objectives/Missions:** Missions should be structured in a way that you do multiple small missions that lead up to a larger one. For example you can engage in intel gathering, convoy interceptions and recon before a large mission that requires you to assault an outpost/base or eliminating/extracting high value targets. \n\nFaction missions would involve you defending their settlements/bases, stealing supplies for them or helping them assault certain locations/objectives too. Doing these missions would increase your standing with their faction while lowering the standing with others. Increasing faction standing would give you access to faction locked gear or support assets, and they will aid you in combat more often. Maybe there would be a final faction mission that results in your faction (the US) officially backing them, making them your permanent ally, influencing the ending of the game. \n\nFinally there would be something that I would call Decisive Battles, which are large defense/offense missions on cities/towns with many sub-objectives. They would involve a lot of units both friendly and enemies fighting each other. Having these take place in cities would be cool as they would open up for much more urban conflicts that contrast with the rest of the game where you fight in more open environments. \n\n# Conclusion\n\nI could go on tbh but yeah theres my idea for the next Ghost Recon game or any open world tactical shooter. Think it blends in a lot of cool elements from other games such as MGSV and Mercenaries, and would leave a lot of room for replayability too."
h7dfhj,University Simulator,"I've had this really good idea (I think it is anyway), where you play as a character who goes to university and stays in student accommodation. You live in a block of so many rooms each with different students who you can communicate with and build up relations with. Gameplay inspired from house party, probably without the sex scenes😂. There would be mini missions like pulling pranks and stuff. Obviously it wouldn't be the academic side as much, but the party side. You would be able to go on nights out to bars/nightclub, interacting with people, playing games like pool and darts, dancing. Like I said it would be a fun game based on the the university experience rather than the academic experience.\n\nYou would get so many days (how long you are usually at university for) and each day you would do stuff to pass the time, and sleep to the next day. By the end of the university year you aim to have lived the university life that would suit you. \n\nLet me know, be brutally honest. I realise this post is random thoughts put together, but that's really all Ive got at the moment."
h7cbcc,I don’t know what to write.,I want a game with the parkour and free running mechanics like assassins creed. And the stealth mechanics of assassins creed. But it’s a modern or even a futuristic setting. With guns and shooting. But also the RPG elements of fallout. Where you know you make your character how you want your playthrough. And it’s some sort anarchy place where there’s no ruler but it’s chaos. Not necessarily post apocalyptic. Like a mix between a society and a non society. But also have some survival elements too. Imo that would be my favorite game.

fw66ei,Avatar The Last Airbender MMORPG,Hello everyone I’m new to this subreddit I had an idea for a MMORPG of avatar the last air bender it’d be in the same vain as KOTR or WOW as the battle style there would be 4 different types of elements you can use it’d 120 years before Aang It’d feature A Leveling up system and different types of attacks you can use changing gear out for stronger results (There would be no one who could play as the avatar) idk its just idea give me some sorta feedback Thank You all
fw1egh,GPS based Strategy Game,"I don't know if this idea exists as a game yet, but I thought it was a good idea. An IOS game that used the real world map as its battlefield. Divide the world into 500 long hexs. Assign a terrain type to each hex with buffs or depuffs. Such as city, forest, plain, mountain, rescource site, ect…. The player can create troops where ever he is located, but can move the troops to locations he isn't. This would encourage people to play even of they are just sitting at home, but allow clever payers to move to real world locations that allows them to get the jump on the enemy. include a clan system, and a competition for rare recourses and you have a recipe for conflict."

fvqawf,"What are some games that have a near-even blend of ranged and melee combat, and a high pace?","These are things I've often used to describe the combat system of my dreams. I'm talking a game where you go from melee attacking to shooting guns in an instant, and even work it into your combos. Bayonetta is close, but I'd be looking for more fleshed-out shooting, potentially with multiple weapons."
fvq4xb,Who can think of the best games to play with friends and family using the Marco Polo app? Let's get creative!,
fvpiz8,An RPG where you can win by dwindling the will to fight,"Where instead of only being able to end battles by HP knockout, you can use your other skills to make them less willing to battle. Every enemy would have ""Weaknesses"" to certain skill types that would lower their will and when it was 0 they would give up (Healing, Status, Buff, Debuff, Attack, Analyze, etc). \n\nThis could also factor into the player characters too, making them need to switch out or replacing their options with a ""Flee"" variant every turn. Ideally one that is separate from Run and would allow the story to continue but just being ""Run"" or putting them into an altered battle state would be acceptable."
fvoz12,WW1 trench raid,"Pretty basic idea, and idk how it hasn't been done yet, but basically there would be two teams, each with 4 or so trench lines, a random team would start then itd go back and forth.\n\nEach team starts the turn with a limited and finite ammount of troops, and each playergoes over the top, tries not to get blasted by artillery fire or cut down by machine guns, and tries to make it into the other teams trench, at this point itd be melee only combat, basically you're trying to whittle down the other teams numbers to a certain point so they'll retreat to the trench line behind them, then they do the same to you. The goal is to push them past the last trench line.\n\nMy idea was, seeing it's a content light game, more time could be spent on graphics quality. If I were to make this shit. Id want it realistic and SERIOUSLY brutal. When a character gets an injury, whether fatal or not, that actual injury in the actual place he was hit is visible. If he gets hit in the jaw with a club, know the jaw down and to the side and make It hang there. If someone gets blasted by artillery, actual animate him blowing up, and make the intestines and limbs fly all over the place, occasionally coming to rest on a players shoulder or some crazy shit. That last bit could also effect the next bit I'm about to write too...\n\nI thought of an anxiety meter system that would work similarly to sanity meters in lovecraftian games. It would fill up whenever you were in the vicinity, or were looking at or going through something fucked up. To lower it you have to exit the trench, take cover somewhere, probably an artillery hole, and either drink, pray, or do something to get it down, then you can continue. If you dont and it fills, a player from the opponents side gets to control your character, and he gets 2x health, 2x speed, 2x strength, and he tries to kill as many of your teammates as he can. \n\nThere could be a hardcore mode where when that last bit happens, the more he kills, the more punishments you get whether that be debuffs, loss of xp, or maybe even level demotion. \n\nThis would obviously fit multiplayer super well, but could be single player too, and the way id do the campaign would be sorta similar to total war in a lot of ways.\n\nIn between turns in the battles, you could choose to either clear out the bodies, increasing morale, decreasing anxiety levels, increasing mobility, so on. Or upgrade your gear, or send out scouts to do recon, clear a path, or set traps for your enemy. This would be a stealth portion of the game, and if you bump into an enemy scout, you'd have to fight him 1 on 1 without attracting too much attention, or you risk getting exposed and cutting the time you have between turns short.\n\nI had some more thoughts on this game I'm pretty sure, so if I remember them I'll post them in the comments."
fvop7k,Card Game RPG,"It would essentially take the idea of the Lord of the Rings LCG, 12 steps further, where you had loot cards with armor, buffs, spells, whatever, that you'd draw when you killed an enemy. That enemy would also itself be a card that you drew at random when you get to that point in that mission.\n\nIt would come with a large paper map, and each location would have it's own buffs and debuffs based on your build and character type and specialty.\n\nMissions would be standard and go in the same order every playthrough, and each mission would have it's own Boss. The way I'd do missions is to have the mission card tell you how many randomly drawn enemies you have to beat to unlock a clue that leads you to the final location. Every mission would require a different ammount of clues, and those clues would also be set for each playthrough, just like the missions.\n\nCombat would be done using dice and chips and shit, in a similar way to games like star wars imperial assault.\n\nThere wouldnt be a merchant, so you'd need a similar health system to dark souls with elixers. They would probably refill at the start of fights. You would be able to upgrade your gear in between missions, and you could swap gear at any thing, as long as it wasnt mid fight.\n\nThere could be skill trees, armor, armor upgrades, all you would need is a pencil, paper, and a calculator and it wouldnt be too complicated.\n\nThere could be ""cut scenes"" that were a paragraph or two in a booklet that came with the game\n\nI've even thought about a system where where there could be people you have to talk to in different locations during your missions, and there could be dialogue with dialogue options in the booklet that are done a similar way to how they do choose your own fate books, and if you fuck something up it could lead you down the wrong direction, and you'd have to retrace your steps to figure out where you went wrong.\n\nThis game could have as many players as you want, and take as long as you want, cause you can fight enemies that you aren't directed to in the mission card for farming xp, skill points, gear, whatever."
fvogz7,Does this mechanic exist in any other game? Need some insight from you guys,"It's not that if it exists I cannot use it in my game, of course I can, but I want to know if it's a rather innovative mechanic or a completely unoriginal one.\n\nIt's for a tower defense game.\n\nJust like in any other TD game, in each level you can have a maximum number of enemies unkilled for you to be able to move on to the next level.\n\nThe difference with other TD games resides in that you don't use money to place towers, you rather have a limited queue of towers you can use. And here comes the mechanic I had in mind: \n\n* When you win a level with less enemies left unkilled than the maximum allowed, for each of those enemies you are rewarded a tower that is added to the queue in the next level.\nSo if in a level you can have maximum 10 enemies left unkilled, and you pass the level with 8 left unkilled, you get 2 bonus towers for the next level.\n* every tower you use it's gone for good, so that puts some pressure on you in the sense that if you fail the level you'll have one less tower available to play the level again.\n* when you run out of towers, game over.\n\n\nIs it balanced? Is it not? What would you change to it to make it better?\n\nEdit: after feedback from you guys, I changed first bullet about how you're rewarded with towers"
fvgxp4,Art Collecting Game,"I’ve never made one of these before, so I’m not exactly sure how to format this, but this is my best attempt. I know this is a bit more of a niche idea, but I think it would be cool none the less. \n\nSo imagine an online game/site that would allow you to draw/paint/design your own art pieces and sell them for a form of cryptocurrency. You could get coins for logging in each day or selling your paintings (or buying them I guess.) The closest thing I could to this system is 2017 Quidd.  Collecting art pieces would also be essential, as it would not only continue the economy, but further your own collection that you can show off to your online friends. \n\nEach painting would come with a small tag on the back that has the original painters name, a small comment from them, the retail price, and the date/year it was created. As a collector of things myself, I always find it interesting to know the history of paintings and other items in my possession. \n\nAlthough I’ve currently only thought about paintings and drawings, I would also like to consider sculptures and other forms of contemporary art. Of course this would be much more difficult to implement, but it seems to have potential none the less. \n\nI think this game would draw in collectors who enjoy having things of their own that allow them to feel more accomplished, like having a one of a kind original painting by a “famous” artist. People could also have galleries and show off their art, maybe even having shows and events around specific artists. Having auctions instead of selling paintings would allow the art to have a larger pool of pricing."

fv826k,Procedurally Generated Dungeon Game,"Game developers of Reddit, I propose to you a challenge. Make a Quake/DOOM first person shooter dungeon game that procedurally generates forever. I'm interested to see what you come up with."
fv4n8j,Self-balancing game,"This isn't a game idea *per se*, it's a specific game mechanic that could be applied to almost any kind of game. Mostly, but not limited to, competitive multiplayer games.\n\nThe idea is to make a system so that developers don't have to spend their time tweaking the numbers in different items and characters so they are balanced. The designer's job then becomes more like creating fun and interesting mechanics instead of nerfing and buffing numbers around. The idea is that the game content would nerf or buff itself automatically depending on each item or character's win/lose and pick rate.\n\nI'll give an example. Imagine a fighting game with the following rules:\n\n- Whenever a character gets picked, it gets slightly nerfed, and if it wins, it gets nerfed a bit more;\n- Whenever a character gets picked and loses, it gets slightly buffed, or if it is not picked, it gets buffed a bit more;\n\nThese nerfs and buffs apply globally in the whole server, so that every copy of the game gets affected. Obviously, these nerfs and buffs should be tiny (for example, like 1/1000 of damage nerf or buff on an attack) so that a single person winning a few matches with a specific fighter won't significantly nerf that character for everyone else around the globe; it'd be necessary to have thousands of people consistently picking and winning with the same character for it to get heavily nerfed.\n\nThe tendency in the long run is that strong characters would get nerfed and weak characters would get buffed.\n\nThere could also exist some anti-volatility rules to avoid quick changes on the numbers. For a competitive game, it would suck for you to log in today and see that your character is much weaker than yesterday, and then log in tomorrow and see that it's back at a much stronger level.\n\nOverall, I think this is an interesting idea. Any thoughts on it?"
fv4kis,A fair take in an RPG tower defense game!,"Hear me out! This idea have been rolling in my head for weeks!\n\nThere are different regions like: (fairy land, volcano empire, vampire castles and even some European themed regions.) every region has 4 - 7 unlockable playable heroes that match the themes of each region. And each region consist of 10 - 20 levels. You unlock heroes by either defeating them as bosses since some of them are going to be bosses, or even allies that you get to slowly know them throughout a region's main story.\n\nLet's not forget that this is a tower defense game, so what I have in mind is like this:\n\nThere are two main roles for all the heroes they are either a melee or a ranger. And then goes other branches like a ranger has: supporter, marskman, wizard and a summoner. And then we can UNLEASH our creativity to make things fun and a little complicated. Lets take the volcano empire as an example. \n\nAs a volcano supporter for instance, it cannot be just a simple healer. We can divide supporters like this: offensive supporters, passive supporters, utility supporters. The support role is a unique take in this kind of games I suppose and it fits perfectly in a tower defense game, thus, a supporter beside the heals that benifits the melee roles it can also provide buffs and cleanse debuffs that enemies may cast on our selected team! So a volcanic supporter would fit as an offensive supporter that lower the enemys base Magic or physical defense so the offensive supporter's main focus is the enemies instead of his allies! Of course, the same beautiful complexity goes for the wizard, marksman and the summoner. \n\nAnd lets not forget the melee roles where there is a tank, a mage fighter, a supportive fighter, a shapeshifter assassin, a swordmaster necromancer! see how awesome this could become! There are tons of ideas! Thats my point. \n\nThere are main stuff for this game which is something like how many units can a melee hero block. And it varies from one melee hero to another. A clear vision of this would look like this: a tank melee hero has somthing like 6 block points, meaning the first 6 enemies he always encounter cannot pass through him unless he is under some sort of debuff from an enemy mage or something. \n\nOr worse the tank dies eventually and enemies will pass easily, while theres an assassin (vampire) melee class that has less block points, but deals more damage than the tank! And to add that delicious vampire theme, he can therefore, buff himself to be able to return a small portion of health everytime he attacks an enemy!\n\n One last main idea for this game, is that every hero has a small tree of skills and passives. Lets say that each character has an average number of 5 - 7 skills and passives inside a tree. The character then has only three slots to equip any skill or passive the player chooses. This will create some insanely fun combos between characters in different regions! \n\n\nI have a lot in mind. But I cannot make this post any longer than this, because it'll get boring. I hope I can see something like this in the future. Or perhaps Im gonna create it in Ps4Dreams."
fv46oq,Industrial Revolution Capitalist/Engineering Game,"A first person game where you build factory complexes like in Satisfactory, but it is set in the 1800s and you have to upgrade your machinery as time goes along. Each factory you build produces something different so you have to connect them by train, canal, or carriage. There would also be a general market you sell all goods to, but you can also build new factories to use your products to manufacture more advanced goods. You would also have to employ people to work in the factories and have to deal with unionization of your employees and treat them nicely, pay them more, allow unionization and earn less money or earn more money and now treat your employees as nicely. The market could also fluctuate due to events not directly in the game such as war, depression, etc. I think the problem with this idea is that it is too complex for the small niche it fills. Not enough people would want to buy it and it would be even more complex than Satisfactory and Factorio."
fv28hb,You Are The Road,"Can anyone on this sub recreate the old web game called, “You Are The Road”??? I used to absolutely love this game. \n\nIf anyone remembers this game, I’m sure you know what I mean. It was a game where you controlled the road, and there was about 8 or so cars racing each other. You could control the turns, bumps, jumps, drops, etc. and could drop boxes in front of the cars to throw them off.\n\nA remake of this game would be awesome, especially if you could do it with some sort of an “upgrade game” twist to it. Give this game a look on YouTube if you haven’t seen it."
fut59e,Fastest Sum | Idea review," I have a mobile game idea, which I am planning to develop, but before starting development I wanted to get views of other people to get a feedback if people would actually like to play such a game or not.\n\nThe idea is related to the subset sum problem in mathematics. So, here it goes.\n\n**Given:** \n\nThere’s a number **X**.\n\nThere’s a **list** of **N** numbers.\n\nPlayer’s objective is to come up with a **subset** of the list which when **summed**, equals the number **X**.\n\n**Example:** \n\nX = 560\n\nList = Will be displayed in a grid\n\n|249|166|110|222|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|106|91|78|472|\n|67|61|56|53|\n|43|41|39|70|\n\n**Number of possible solutions is 4**\n\n1. 166 + 106 + 106 + 91 + 91 = 560\n2. 222 + 91 + 91 + 78 + 78 = 560\n3. 110 + 110 + 106 + 78 + 78 + 78 = 560\n4. 56 + 56 + 56 + 56 + 56 + 56 + 56 + 56 + 56 + 56 = 560\n\n**Now, there can be various gameplay modes**\n\n1. Single player Timed mode:- Say, player is given 5 minutes how many solutions can the player come up with.\n2. Single player mode:- Player has to come up with the smallest solution (Solution No. 1 in above case)\n3. Multiplayer Mode:\n   1. Mode 1:- 2 or more players are playing, who ever comes up with a solution first wins.\n   2. Mode 2:- Timed:- 2 or more players, whoever comes up with most number of solutions in say 5 minutes, wins.\n\n**I would really appreciate any feedback/thoughts.**\n\n1. **Does the Idea really suck or is it okay/good? If not, any improvements?**\n2. **Would the game be too hard to play, is it even mentally possible to come up with such solutions?**"

fur7b7,Vigilante - GTA / Red Dead Type open world.," Game Idea : Vigilante  \n\n\nUsing the Red Dead 2 / GTA V Engine  \n\n\nThe  player takes the role of a character (player gets to chose what their  character looks like \*)  who is suffered abuse in the family home as a  kid (part of the beginning tutorial will be standing up to their dad  protecting their mum and the police not helping because dad was a cop  himself), and in the present they witness domestic violence and step  in... sort of a tutorial / backstory in one.... makes them decide to  make the change that the police aren't doing.  \n\n\nThe game is about  living the vigilante life, looking for notoriety or keeping in the  shadows. Wearing an identifiable costume or constantly changing outfits  to avoid recognition.  Helping the police and trying to avoid them at  the same time.  \n\n\nA story line would go from helping people with  little things, escorting someone safely home at night, saving a drugged  person from date rape, stopping a mugging but two different story lines  emerge.... local bikie gang and an organized crime mafia.  \n\n\nLike GTA and Red Dead, there would be random events where players can up their notoriety, the player will have a bitcoin account where the public can  donate when players help out the community allowing you to buy weapons,  supplies, hideouts, vehicles etc.  Players who go the recognizable  costume route get more notoriety and more money BUT its also easier for  criminals and police to find you making the game harder.   \n\n\nBikie  Gang Story : the local gang is distributing drugs and weapons throughout  the city and running illegal prostitution rings. Easier to find as they  all wear 'colors'  \n\n\nOrganized Crime : Drug manufacturers, Illegal  Gambling &amp; People Smuggling, Dirty Cops, Harder to locate as they  look like businessmen.  \n\n\nPossible end goal is the current mayor...  he's corrupt and also the police officer that protected your dad when he  was beating your mum.  (Not sure on that part....but I'm just throwing  an idea out there)  \n\n\nIts a little bit Batman.... i get it.... but have fun with that, make cheeky reference to this throughout the game.  \n\n\n•  Player customization... let the players choose gender, race etc,  players love customizing their characters makes them feel more involved  in the game."
fuq3vy,Casual and customizable society building game,"There are multiple games, where you can build your own society, civilization, hideout, safe-haven etc. All of these games focus on resource gathering, production and building.\n\nWhat if there was a game, where you start a society in a post-apocalyptic world, where it has been long enough time, that the world has reverted back to it's pre-humanized form.\n\nThe game:\n\nThere has been some kind of calamity, that wiped out most of the humans on Earth. A sizeable amount of people have found refuge in self-sustaining shelters, sprinkled across the world. These people have stayed in those shelters for so long, that all the danger of the calamity has long since past and Earth has reverted back to it's natural state (All city have crumbled and rusted to dust, fauna has returned to previously urbanized areas and so on).\n\nFor some reason, everyone is coming out to the open, from the shelter into the wide open new Earthly world.\n\nYou control the selected leader of one of those pioneers, with a handful of people, like 8-10 people. Since these people are from a time of ours, they have previous knowledge of our pre-reverted Earth. You control the game from the leader's viewpoint, assigning tasks for people with different traits and specialities, record all the findings in this new reverted Earth, study and discover forgotten technologies and so on.\n\nYou start the game like any other resource management game, where you build facilities, homes for your people, research to make things easier and find new things.\n\nBut here's the unique part of this idea:\n\nAs time goes, your people wish to live in world like our's right now AKA with governments, systems, finance and so on.\n\nSo as your society progresses and evolves, people want standardisation.\n\nYou start making different laws and such, starting off simple, like no killing, no stealing, obvious stuff. But once you get more people (either by birth or immigration) you start to make rights as well. Like now people have a right to property. But how do you get property, if everything you make is for all to use? You can make your OWN currency.\n\nYou'll get to design, what will your currency will look like. Are you gonna use coins, banknotes or both? What will they be made out of? What kind of design will it have? Will it have just a symbol, or will it have a portrait of your leader?\n\nAs you make money, you have to watch out for inflation, too.\n\nAs you advance and communications also advance, you'll come in contact with other players controlling leaders with their own society, laws and right, currency and such. You can make pacts and unions, economic unions, where all players in the union can vote, what the common currency will look like, by voting the design aspects of it.\n\nAs you can see, it's mostly focuses on actually designing your currency, laws and rights, the way your society works and so much more.\n\nRight now, IDK what else to add, so feel free to add your own ideas, what should be tweaked, what should be removed and so on. I want this idea to be as polished as possible."
fuojws,Night Based Shooter Ideas?,So I am an aspiring game developer and I work alone. Recently I had to quit working on my last game because most people didn’t like the idea. My next idea was to make a night based shooter but that’s all I’ve got so far. Any ideas that I could add into my next game? Thanks in advance!

fulswb,"Asymmetrical multiplayer game (I know these get a lot of shit). One person plays from a RTS type view (Spawn Minions, build a base). The other team plays as a fps and their goal is to destroy the RTS players base.","I know asymmetrical games get a lot of shit (Evolve I'm looking at you) but I do think that's because one hasn't been done right (Hopefully Doom Eternal's BattleMode fixes that). \n\nIf there is a game like this already please let me know.

fujr5u,Journey to Pakistan,"This game is to be played in real life.\n\nEvery player gets a car. There are parking spaces marked on the floor (one less than number of players for the first round). The players drive in circles around the parking spaces while Arabic/Pakistani music is being played. When the music stops, everyone has to find a parking spot as fast as possible. The one player who couldn't find a spot is out of the game. One parking spot is removed for the next round.\n\nNow comes the best part: all the cars are trapped with a bomb! The losers die by car bomb.\n\nDISCLAIMER: Never actually play this game! I do not encourage this!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBefore you call me a racist, let me explain the backstory: A friend of mine saw an Instagram post about Pakistan being the number one recommended holiday destination. Because of this he said: ""I don't want to go to Pakistan. If you go there, you'll probably die of a car bomb!"" Then I had the idea for this game."

fuh57h,Simple 3D adventure games,"I am developing a 3D engine but I need a game to go along with it. I want to keep things relatively simple, so don't go thinking open world or AAA graphics. A simple cartoon art style with limited size levels are my main restrictions.\n\nI'd also like the game to be relaxing (but this is not a hard constraint, if you got a great idea for an FPS that could work, that's good too!). Something where you can just pop in and play for a while, like a very simplified Animal Crossing for example? Or a fun little demo like Gravity Bone. Something that can show off my engine while being a reasonable scope so that I can make it alone.\n\nI'd love to hear some ideas!"
fuajyy,Food Royale (not Cuisine Royale),"Battle royale where one use food like sweets, cheese and chips to make someone overweight and stop moving. Dancing, running and digestive pills act as health potion. Get food as ammunition. Instead of shrinking circle, there will be random explosion of sweets, cheese and chips on the map."
fu6jo1,Third person horror puzzle game with a twist,"Not sure if this is already a game but....\n\nImagine playing a third person horror game where you think (and in some cases are) playing as a character from a third person perspective, only twist is you would have to avoid anything that gives off a reflection, the twist would be that, while you’re controlling the character from the third person view, you’re also controlling and playing as what’s lurking behind him. The puzzle aspect would be to mainly avoid mirrors, puddles, etc. so you’re not detected. There could be an initial sequence where the character walks away and the player would be confused as to why he’s controlling a camera only to safely look in a mirror and realize what they’re really playing as."

fu5hep,"What would a ""Tiger King"" web based game look like?",After binging the Tiger King documentary I thought it would be fun to throw together a simple flash style game for Kongregate or Armor Games about the absurdity of the show. But other than trading tigers and ordering hitmen against your competition I'm fresh out of ideas.
fu4ju7,A hack-n-slash with the design sensibilities of Doom Eternal,"Fast-moving, punchy animations, and an emphasis on combining movement and off-tools with your normal attacks. You swing around a giant sword, too, but you also have to throw in melee punches and kicks, occasionally dodge, block, and counter, and quick-swap to secondary weapons on occasion, as well as pay attention to your positioning and use your platforming abilities to keep in an advantageous spot, or else you risk getting surrounded/trapped."
ftz8r4,Submarine Pirates in an unforgiving world with a lot of faction politics,"I don't care how crazy you think I am this is brilliant:\n\nPost-apocalyptic (or something) undersea setting. Staying below the waves is dangerous, going above is suicidal. The player starts with a safe ""Home base"", and can only save within a friendly base. Lots of resources to harvest, lots of dangerous creatures that will eat you if you try. So far, so subnautica.\n\nBut, there are other undersea factions, traders, scavengers, etc. The player can make friends with some of them, gaining access to additional save spots, repair/crafting facilities, merchants, etc. The player's reputation can also go down, though (by raiding ships, helping their enemies, all the usual things.) Once you've managed basic survival and have one port where you can show your face, advancing becomes an economic problem - but getting paid isn't easy. There's only so much you can make poking around the ""Safe"" zones you're survived so far, and to advance in the plot you need to get swole, so you have to turn to more dangerous work: Mining, piracy, theft, smuggling or bounty hunting.\n\nMining (or salvaging) involves poking your head into the most dangerous parts of the map, filling your hold with stuff that doesn't show up elsewhere, and high-tailing it for safety. It's risky work, which makes it all the riskier because pirates don't want to do it - they'd rather kill you on the way back when you've got a full hold, an empty tank, and have already used up your defensive measures on the local wildlife.\n\nSo, be a pirate yourself, at a price. If you're identified on attack (which is hard to avoid)  whatever faction you pick on will rapidly decide you're an enemy, which has consequences - no safe harbors in their territory, attacks from their ships, etc. The environment was hostile to begin with, but you've gone and made it worse. What used to be a nerve-wracking trek in and out of the sea dragon's cave is now twice as long and involves evading HK subs on the way in and out. The game would be set up so it would be hard not to piss *anyone* off, but you have to be smart about which enemies you can afford to make.\n\nOr, don't make any, because you don't get caught. You can steal quietly  from either bases or ships, but it takes skill, special equipment and/or inside knowledge of base layouts and back doors. What's more, no faction will buy goods stolen from itself, and friendly factions share news - to be able to make it as a thief, you have to be on visiting terms with both sides of a conflict. On foot you can only steal lightweight, high-value items, but with the right skills you might trick them into loading bulk supplies onto your ship and forgetting they did so.\n\nSmuggling: Illicit goods - including drugs, dangerous objects and stolen supplies - might be illegal but not impossible to sell. This option requires the personal touch. No one buys that stuff from strangers. Even if you have a willing buyer, that might not be the same person that checks incoming ships. Each base would have some option for the player to discover - a back door, an official who can be bribed, something, but it takes time/resources/skill. Maybe if they like you as a military asset they'll green-light you for explosives scans because of your own torpedoes, and you can sneak in more than you bargained for. There's also a whole side of piracy that focuses on smugglers, since they can't run to the authorities like miners can, and sometimes hide their stashes unguarded as they try to set up a deal. Might be easy money, might be booby trapped... but either way, you have to be half a smuggler yourself, to sell what you steal.\n\nFinally, you can stay on the right side of the law, and take on the dangerous work of hunting smugglers or pirates yourself. Factions won't pay you for that work unless you're well trusted, though, so you'd better keep your nose clean, and not get tempted by all that illegal, *expensive* cargo the people you're fighting are carrying...\n\nThis is fairly similar to some space games that exist, but I think it has (as I envision it) two big advantages. First, underwater is scarier and more interesting than space. Underwater can be crowded, with terrain, things to hide behind, view distance, etc.\n\nSecond, and this would drive up the budget but make it so much better: No procedural generation. Contacts aren't just a random-generated name and a reputation value, they're a fleshed-out person with dialogue lines that let you gain their trust and/or find a way to blackmail them. Each base would also be hand-designed... there wouldn't be hundreds of them, a dozen would be generous, but there could be some human intelligence behind their layout, security systems and vulnerabilities. \n\nAlso, no trade. Trade is boring. You might be able to make a tiny profit buying in one place and selling in another, but if the goods are legal you're not making a real profit doing that."
ftxzuq,Brothers in Arm RPG,"Shower thought that I had this morning. I absolutely love the Brothers in Arm games of the 6th generation of consoles/PC era. I think that adding an rpg element with permadeath unit would be interesting.\n\nYou would command a platoon and your units could level up and stats would improve. If your units died in combat, they would be forever gone and you would have to recruit more privates to replace them. Kinda like X-Com made a love child with Brothers in Arms. \n\nAm I on to something or just unrealistic. Did anyone else enjoy the Brothers in Arms games?"
ftpvzi,A VR choose-your-path game with actual voice detection,"Kinda like a telltale game, but the game is programmed to recognise loads of different sentences and makes the story go according to what you actually say irl. Quick time events could be done as you normally would do things in vr, but you would still have the timer. Some exploration wouldn't hurt, either."
fto16f,BOOM,It’s a shooter game only instead of guns there is bombs. You start as a human with a bomb and if you make a meme out of this (boomer) I will kill you. You also get bombers every time you get 200 diamonds their bombs change and they get new abilities like multibomb where the bomb split into 2 smaller bombs or darkobomb where if it hits someone it turns their camera to black and it does not have blood it has confetti when you kill someone but you can buy other explosions and effects yea I feel awkward
ftmp2t,What should I do with my car models?,"Hey guys, not sure what flair to use here. Anyways, I have design a good bit of low poly cars, cars, trucks, buses, a tank, an ambulance, et cetera. I designed this because another dev wanted to team up and we had an idea of delivering things.\n\nYou're in worn out car and you must deliver pizza to and from your job. There's different terrain that makes certain upgrades better than others, then you move on to do other jobs, you get a limo and you're a limo driver, you're a paramedic in an ambulance, et cetera. They ended up ghosting me, I'm guessing because of personal issue, which is fine. But now I have these models with no home.\n\nCould anyone help me come up with some simple ideas? Something simple like this:\n\nOnline multiplayer derby game. You all have front bumper guard and must ram the front of your vehicle to the side or rear of another. There could be a free for all, teams, a sort of platform where you could knock opponents off, anything really."
ftkl5y,A 16 Bit 2D Platformer where you can only jump a limited amount of times,Now the idea is that you could only say have around 5 jumps each level but none of these jumps are really ever required but instead it would focus on working with the environment to complete or get over obstacles. Some other features would include a roll ability as well as a little leap ability where you leap forward a little bit. The main focus is finding objects that can either make you jump high in the air or give you a boost to use your roll abilities or if you needed a leap ability to just make it to another platform. The jumps would mainly be used to make certain obstacles easier to get over or find hidden collectables only found when doing certain jumps to areas. Give me your opinion on my idea obviously it needs some fleshing out but do you think this is a good idea. (On a side note if I tried making this game it would be in gamemaker)
fthr6u,Hi Guys a company contacted me today with this thought. They want me to develop a 2D game to spread awareness of covid19 on ways people are supposed to keep themselves safe from spreading or being infected in every way.,
fthflc,A 12 vs 1 game where 12 people hunt a super powered individual,12 hunters have to track down and kill a super powered individual while the super powered individual attempts to kill the hunters. The super powered person has a set of abilities that will grow stronger as the match goes on. The match ends when the super powered I individual either  dies or the hunters die.\n\nThe first thing I thought of was the ability to slow and eventually stop time. The super powered individual (I’m just gonna call said person an SPI) starts the match with the ability to slow time (players will look around slower and projectiles will move slower.) over the course of the match the SPI will be able to slow time more and eventually bring time to a halt for a few seconds at a time.\n\nThe second power I thought of was the ability to control the hunters temporarily viewing the game through said hunter’s eyes (and this ability would grow more powerful as the match goes on. The third was invisibility which is... well... invisibility. Any thoughts?
fth73p,Idea: horror game that takes place in an abandoned manor.,"I know, the title is probably boring but hear me out. The story would be that the player broke into the manor trying to score some easy luxurious items but is instead confronted by lots of different phobias. The game will have the player find his way through the manor to try to escape the horror. The game then reveals that he is being watch via stuffed animal ducks which represents the fear that a duck is always watching. So, now that the player knows he’s being watched, he has a choice. Find the person watching, or continue trying to escape. I think it would be a good idea. I have no idea how to bring this to life but I’d love to try when I’m older and much more capable of success. Let me know if you have any questions or are interested in hearing more"

ftdp7y,Interlocking exploration and trippy bossfights with variable space density,"**What if a mechanic of exploration involved volumes or areas within the world of the game having different densities of space?**\n\nNon-euclidean styles of world design where the fastest way from any one point to another stops being a straight line. When you phrase it like that, all exploration games work like this, but there are a few key differences that make this idea worthwhile.\n\n**This idea is a modification of an idea presented by CodeParade on youtube:**\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEB11PQ9Eo8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEB11PQ9Eo8), and I can't give enough credit for inspiration to his video for this idea.\n\nIn the video, CodeParade achieves a non-euclidean world by using a system he describes very accurately as similar to Portal. But what if the space in these areas was actually denser, better put as curved? The application of CodeParade's ideas was that you could put a short tunnel that was long on the inside, and multiple rooms into one room. But because of the Portal-like way this was implemented, you couldn't do something like stand in the wall of the tunnel and see the long inside on the left and the short outside on the right. If the space within the tunnel was actually denser space and not separate geometry you get teleported to, you could see both.\n\nNow take away the wall of the tunnel and you get to my point. The applications of variable space density would be including all of CodeParade's Portal-like system's application *and* allow for more flexible and efficient construction of non-euclidean worlds *and* make some super trippy visuals that can't be done with CodeParade's system (don't get me wrong, Portal-like can do trippy, but there are some other facets to my system that would really blow a player's mind).\n\nVisualization of the tunnel with denser space thingy: [https://imgur.com/a/xk1h8HL](https://imgur.com/a/xk1h8HL).\n\n**All you would need to do (wow that's an understatement), is create a mesh that, within its volume, space would be x times denser than outside.** I am not a programmer, and I'm not going to pretend to know what I'm talking about when it comes to making this mechanic. But let's say you have figured out how to create this mesh asset, or alternatively a point with a radius of space effected by x change in density.\n\nLet's call x change in density ""H"" for convenience.\n\nNow let's make softness, or ""S,"" the rate at which H approaches its desired value the further inside it gets from the edge of the mesh, or the closer H gets to its center point in the radius example. The larger the value of S, the more gradually H approaches the desired value (let's make the desired value P). Softness, if you've ever used a brush in photoshop or blender or most any program with brush tools in them, should create a good visual analogy for this.\n\nLooking at the first visualization, S would be 0, and P would be 2x. The next visualization also has P as 2x, but S is now 1: [https://imgur.com/HKxUjR9](https://imgur.com/HKxUjR9).\n\n**So what would be some applications for this in practical (real) game design? In the title, I put ""interlocking exploration"" without much justification. By this, I mean a game entirely based in, or with a few sections on, rooms that seem like they're occupying the same space.** This is the most obvious application and it a: has been done before, and b: works better with CodeParade's system. \n\nAn application that would use this system best would use smoothness to visibly warp space around the player. Variable density, as all more outlandish game mechanics, would fit very naturally in a puzzle game. But there was one more thing in the title which is the conclusion on my theoretical applications for this theoretical game mechanic that will probably never get made:\n\n**Bossfights but they shoot space densifiers at you.**\n\nOne thing I believe this method for which would be far better than CodeParade's is when these meshes and points of H begin to move. Portal-like non-euclidean worlds would still seamlessly teleport you to the same place if the portals moved, but variable space density non-euclidean worlds would take you to a different point. \n\nWhat if the player could see these areas from a distance through some sort of goggle item they can equip?\n\nWhat if they had to either dodge the areas to avoid disorientation or take the plunge in an attempt to master movement in these strange new spaces?\n\nWhat an evil robot was shooting these at them.\n\n**But don't limit yourself to that.**\n\nI bet people with some actual programming experience could seriously one-up me for applications here, this is the extent of what I came up with within a few minutes.\n\n^(Hope it doesn't sound too daunting to program. One idea I had was deciding what objects the H mesh effects and how, like decreasing the speed of players, enemies, and projectiles so you don't have to deal with too much weird math. But again, I'm not a programmer, just wanted to take that shot in the dark.)"
ft98y6,A Rick and Morty like FPS,"This is a game idea I’ve had for a while, but basically the game is a character based FPS like Overwatch or Tf2, but with the art style and humor of Rick and Morty.

The game is mainly humor based, but every once in a while it gets really dark or makes you see the world in a different light."

fss8so,Everything Explodes - An action game in which everything explodes.,"The player/hero character was turned into a bio-weapon some time ago but managed to escape. He's cursed with a peculiar trait: *Anything he touches will explode shortly after he stops touching it.* He's managed to live a secluded life using gloves and regular clothing to not touch anything.\n\nBut at the start of the game he awakens in the middle of a secret military base, stripped down to his underwear.\n\nThe gameplay starts similar to Mirror's Edge, except you have to keep running to avoid the explosions behind you. The only way you can stand still is if you took a huge leap from the last place you touched. Throughout all this you're being shot at by clandestine soldiers, and you can grab any objects (coffee mugs, boxes, etc.) to use as grenades.  You could grab a gun, shoot and throw it when it's empty.\n\nThe game slows down when you get shoes and pants for a larger focus on combat. When that happens, the plot unfolds in such a way to make you stop running away and turn to fight back instead. You're going to blow up their whole operation."
fsrpjl,Andromeda Royale,"I have never been a fan of Battle Royale games, so here is my idea for one that suits my ideas of a better one...\n\nNOTE: It takes place in Andromeda, (The Milky Ways nearest major galaxy) and there will be multiple maps. Each one is a made up planet with it's own unique landscape, size, and places to go.\n\n1. The battle pass goes like this- There are no seasons, so everyone and anyone can be on a different battle pass, called a battle pass ""stage."" All you have to do is pay ten bucks ONCE, and to get to another battle pass stage is by beating the first battle pass stage, and so on.\n2. The battle pass will come with cosmetics, of course, like skins for the fighters and weapon skins, but can also come with weapon upgrade points to upgrade the guns in your arsenal, cash (The currency in the game), and fighters.\n3. Fighters are the characters you can unlock and play as. Each fighter has different abilities. Like the ability to teleport, or ability to double jump, you know, the basics. They all have cool downs, of course.\n4. There is still stuff you can buy with real money. Like, every now and then, premium fighters. Other stuff as well like extra cosmetics and buying more cash.\n5. There are vehicles in the game like hovercrafts, boats, and something flying, maybe like a small spaceship or helicopter.\n6. Each player you kill earns you cash. Each objective earns you cash. And finally, you can collect resources. The amount of resource you have at the end is automatically sold for cash.\n7. Resources come in variety. The least expensive being alien shroom, and the most expensive being Cladtanium. (My made up mineral) Some things you will have to wait and protect to collect.\n8. Objectives include slaying alien monsters, capturing points, stealing data from crash sites, and collecting a certain amount of a certain resource.\n9. weapons come in different categories. Shotgun, Energy, Rifle, Light, and Explosive. Then there are sub-categories. Like machine gun, sniper, heavy, light, and advanced. For Example, sniper and machine gun fall under rifle. heavy will either fall under shotgun or explosive. light falls under Then advanced falls under energy. Light is a section of its own. There are different gun models for each category and sub-category. For light, that includes smg's, lmg's, and pistols.\n10. Thats it. It is pretty simple and straight foward. I wish I could program and make this game but I'm dumb."
gb765w,Base building as a fleshy mass,"The general premise is you are a parasitic lump of meat, think the Flood, looking to take over a planet. It is set on an alien world that has familiar concepts to Earth such as currency, politics, war, etc. But there are unfamiliar concepts such as an extremely strange religion, more cult-like than religion. The game starts in an alien forest, still green but with a hint of exotic colors and strange animals.\n\nI imagine a few starting areas, a forest, desert, city, and farmland. You move around then pick a location, each area will have a few sings as to where the best place is, for example, in the forest, the more vegetation, the more animals. Once the starting location has been selected you will dig underground and bury yourself (In the city, you enter the sewers), and enter a Spore cell stage like level.\n\nOnce in this level, you go around underground and hunt for small animals, minerals, and anything else that might help you grow. Once you reach a mass of 10 Kg, you then pick a permanent location to settle down, and 'sprout' a unit. These units will gather materials for you. You have a unit limit, etc.\n\nI'm thinking little to no hud. The tutorials will appear as signs in the dirt in forests and farmland, spray-paint in the city, etc. You will know when your heavy enough when you start making horrible sounds, to grow something simply press a button, etc. Tell me what you think."
gb499b,An engaging point and click adventure,"Hi all, I'm actually here looking to build an idea a bit better. I like the idea of point and click to move and something along the lines of dungeon exploring. But now that really feels like Diablo wrapped in a different skin. There may be combat but I don't like hack n slash kind of games. I want it to be slightly tactical and make the player think about their next move. I also won't be doing anything with puzzles, that takes much more work than player time spent. Can anyone offer an idea to give my core mechanics some more substance?"

gb2bje,Similar to Predator: HG,"Basically like predator hunting grounds except with Star Wars... a group of 12-16 rebel soldiers try to make it across a variety of different maps with a variety of different objectives, taking down groups of storm troopers as you go, while another player controls a sith trying to hunt them down.  Got a ton of other ideas to make it more exciting but that’s basically the gist of it.  Also could apply the same idea to a zombie game with one player controlling hordes of zombies trying to take down a group of survivors."

gavtx7,A Similar Type of Game,"So I was thinking of this recently playing SWBF2 (Star Wars Battlefront 2) HVV. I kinda love the game mode despite its MANY FLAWS, its a cool game mode to me personaly. So i thought maybe they should make a Mortal Kombat version instead, same premise but with more graphic violence i guess haha. It probably sounds dumb as Im writing this, but I like to think to myself its cool. Again the technical side could be complex of course due to certain abilites. However, I kept thinking why not it kinda seems good at the same time, how would it work? Well similar to HVV in Star wars. They have kombat kards and each of them does a little boost, have a stamina bar so you cant spam swinging. How would you perform fatalities then? Well i was thinking same mechanic like for honor when you do a execution where you can press either button you set the fatality on and can perform that action but again can be interrupted. Also I dont know if anyone remembers from MK9 where through the round armor will be destroyed, I think they could bring that back and add that too the game as well where Scorpions Mask is broken and shows some of his skull, or the clothing is ripped up and cuts all over (probably sound like a maniac). What i alaso think woud be cool is how they introduce each character on opposing teams they have certain intros just like HVV where for example Scorpion is crawling out of the ground and then have like sub zero form a ice clone and the break it for no reason I dont know haha. I think it would be cool, but again probably sounds dumb while writing this out. Again just thought id share this because it sounds cool to me and i know it sounds like a copy paste of star wars but i can imagine a game like this in the MK Series not standalone of course but as a cool gamemode. Thanks if you guys read this all the way through, if i dont make sense Im sorry ill try my best to explain."
gavd00,this would seem like a really fun game,ok so\n\nits first person and third and is located in a small town\n\nyou the character will be able to complete certain quests to unlock superpowers like telekinesis time stop flight etc\n\nyou will have random encounters with other people with superpowers and i think it would be fun to mess around with your powers and stuff\n\nit will mainly be a sandbox\n\nbye\n\nthis is kinda a big idea but you dont have to add all those things\n\ni just want a game to mess around with timestop

ganw75,Educational-Simulation Game. Working Title/Concept: First Responder - subtitle: Every second counts OR Reflex and Situations - subtitle: 4 Goals of survival. A game where you're put in the shoes of a first responder or bystander with a handgun license and the situations they may face,"The game starts off with a black background with white text that lists the 4 Goals of survival (based on Varg Freeborn {hopefully with his permission/involvement}) when put into a situation where lethal force may be used and a evaluation of your actions\n\nIntro: 1st as a normal law abiding citizen, you first start with a tutorial with videos and how to play the game, the videos will have someone with CHL/CCW Credentials who explain to you what is the point of self defense law and how to use it with responsibility. What the ramifications of a handgun license holds legally and civilly, and how you have a choice in protecting you, your family and anyone from harm.\n\nGameplay:\nCivilian: You will be put in a situation where you the player believes there is crime or violence afoot, and you the character goes to investigate, it can start and end very quickly depending on your choices which include nonviolent intervention (call 911, call out to the aggressor or victim, ask questions, or simply look the other way {will explain later}) or force (drawing weapon, giving commands, hands on approach, or at the very end what matters: LETHAL FORCE)\nPolice: Similar to the civilian however several major gameplay changes:\n1. The scenario starts with a 911 call which will be random (depending on game mode and difficulty) where the operator will greet and ask questions which will be random on what questions and how the answers are given and how the calls end whether they be: no answer, disrupted call, or terminated with no incident (not hung up beyond caller's control)\n2. Map system similar to games like 911 operator on where the C.O.P.'s (constable on patrol) are and where you place them before the call comes in and what route they take which is dependent on the player which include but are not limited to: back roads, highways, feeders, old pebble roads, sidewalks, even through obstructions which may hamper your response time and may or may not include lawsuits, disciplinary action, awards, and criminal prosecution. ALL OF WHICH will change how the next feature goes.\n3. ACTION: The scene is set and now you start, the game will have a bird's eye view but will change depending on difficulty where the camera is (more on that later). The game plays in ""real time"" because the game will slow down when the player wants to, in order to pick and choose an action, each action will have it's own options on how to proceed(plan on using key bindings instead of on screen buttons with some qte events). Example 1: Speech (calm/stern/aggressive: command, inform, question) Example 2. Target (subject/victim/bystander/any emergency service employee {police, ems, fire}) Example 3. ACTION (Draw: service weapon/taser/baton/mace, Deploy: {see before}, Arrest: place handcuffs/restrain/place on patrol vehicle/curb/cell/chair) more to come\n4. Backup: Depending on how you have officers respond they could quicker than you, take some time all the while you need backup immediately, or unable to come at all(but not all units)\n5. Units: think of the game as being the god of fate, you control the little actions each person you control makes and for better or worse the outcome may be what matters\n6. Time and turns: the game will operate on real time however depending on difficulty the flow and control on time the player has will be restricted the higher the difficulty is: at the easiest you can slow, fast forward, even rewind/Hardest: Real time and only fast forwards when no action can be taken by either party whether by control over one or stalemate for however many seconds the ai chooses to react later\n7. Difficulty: this might be the more controversial idea, I don't want the game to simply be a run of the mill strategic limited movement, RNG, broken AI kind of game, I want it to be an experience, I kind of which where anyone who thinks they know better because they saw the outcome on the news and think that person is automatically wrong for what they thought and did would be detrimental to someone's life. So here's how it goes\nTheatrical: you watch, you don't get to act, and you have access to one good scenario and one bad scenario, but more or less this is part of the tutorial\nWhite: Every situation will only have one set outcome and the game stops at the 3rd level and requires you to increase difficulty to advance to the next levels\nNormal: the factors won't come into play, you will have access to one good or bad outcome for each level and will cap off at the 10th level\nYellow: Can be unlocked after completing 1 scenario and factors such as: your characters attributes(more on that another time), the scenario's actors and environment, and partial control on time will be taken into account\nOrange: Necessary on completing the game, also: Real time with very limited times you can slow down in order to do a quick action, the scenarios will be slightly more diverse than yellow which include randomized attributes of characters including your own and will include the 4 Goals of survival which MUST be met in order to advance to the next level.\nRED ALERT: Available after beating the game on Orange difficulty (will elaborate later)\n\nEvaluation: The scenarios that will be planned and made will go through real people with education and extensive background on use of force scenarios. They will give their take on how the situation would go if it was them in their shoes and give a recommendation on a certain action that could change the outcome (example: don't let the aggressor get too close, get the victim away from the area, draw weapon when aggressor sets sights on you or even: call the non/emergency and just watch in case the situation gets worse). A list detailing crucial factors such as: distance, weapons present, actions prior to close involvement, etc. And a list of recommended actions taken or not in the form of a flow chart similar to the butterfly effect, which will include the 4 Goals of survival"
gam34n,Streets Of Rage Style Game But Cyberpunk,"To be fair the SOR franchise already has a few elements which fit with the cyberpunk aesthetic, electronic music, slums, neon lighting, crime, corruption, robots, cyborgs etc so I think it would be cool to see a similar game which is set few decades in the future, really leans in to a Cyberpunk style and turns everything up to 11.\n\nI'd like to characters with more diverse special abilities too, stealth, cybernetic ""magic"", hacking to gain access to alternative routes and get credits from ATMs (credits used for implants, weapons etc), some battles taking place in VR, that kind of thing."
gaho3v,Looking for interesting ideas for a 2D turn based rogue-like,"I'm developing a fantasy rogue-like dungeon crawler and looking for creative systems, creatures, locations, items. I am primarily interested in unique magic mechanics. My current idea is for the player to be able to absorb energy from different magical objects and defeated enemies scattered throughout the dungeon and use to create spells like in Magicka. What do you think?"
gafwjr,Gimmicky RPG/challenge game that may work,"I've always thought a great gimmick for an rpg would be the opposite than what we're used to.\n\nLet's say the main character is a suicidal emo kid - or some type of beast like a goblin to make it not hit so close to home.  You are in a hospital in recovery, or something of the sort.  You leave your room without permission and you are trying to find anything to harm yourself.  You would probably hear Bill yell ""Pills here!"" Each ""battle"" would consist of you using abilities or surroundings to knock your hp down to a certain point, while the ""enemy"" is using their recovery abilities to keep you alive.  Those jerks.\n\nAnother version of this would be just playing the same thing but instead of being suicidal, you're a vampire or some type of undead.  They're healing you to death and you need to stop them."
gaek0e,A Soulsborne-type game set in a retrofuture/noir world like Blade Runner,"Watched Blade Runner for the first time last night and couldn't help but think how well the setting and story fits into the Soulsborne genre.\n\nSTORY\n-You're a badass future cop/bounty hunter/[insert main villain, probably something similar to replicants?] hunter, tasked with flushing them out of society.\n-Similar to Katana Zero, hero's got some relation to them, like a [stilldunnowhattocallem] who's like, family to him, or something like that.\n\nVISUALS\n-Dark, gritty, intimidating. Neon lights and signs dot the melancholic city scape. You, the player live in the worst part of town, so you get to see the absolute worst the city has to offer as a result. I'm talking hearing/watching citizens in Midgar (FF7/R)have their lives fall apart level.\n-One distinct idea I have is a retrofuturist chinatown stage where the difficulty comes more from distinguishing the guy you're supposed to catch from the crowds of people. Maybe it's like a stakeout -turned-chase mission in which you track a target who realizes your presence. Perhaps there's a button that lets you shoo civilians for a clearer shot?\n\nSETTING\n-A seedy, dystopian, futuristic metropolis, so every indie game ever, haha. Now in 3D tho!\n-I just think 3D can convey it far more effectively than 2D has so far, but maybe that's just me. Imagine stuff like that one enemy in Bloodborne hopping out of doorways you can't see (the eyes guy) but in a setting closer to our own! When things like this are closer to our own setting I personally think it makes it scarier.\n\nGAMEPLAY\n-Maybe almost like Megaman/Cuphead instead, where it's sort of a boss rush. ""Stages"" are just different districts that you, badass future cop guy, are dispatched to. (But that you are free to return to later)\n-Game plays like a Soulsborne/DmC hybrid, combat is grounded and weight based, with room for style. Maybe Dead Rising is more accurate?\n-Watch the Rufus Shinra boss fight in FF7R, THAT'S how OUR main character can handle grunt enemies, redirecting their weight and flipping them, parrying projectiles, suplexing, imagine this all with a badass black cloak flowing behind you just dashing around the screen.\n-Grappling hook! It'd be something with a variety of uses, traveling between rooftops, catching runners, even has uses in combat like pulling things off the ground to use as projectiles.\n-Roy and Pris are like the two biggest inspirations for boss fights. Pris cuz holy fuck something like that'd make for a crazy gaming experience a la the guardian ape. Hell, maybe enemies only take one shot if you're a good player (like in MGS w/ headshots) so you shoot this Not!Pris boss, and she drops, then IMMEDIATELY rises screaming bloody murder. \n-Maybe make these boss fights more emotionally charged, give the player ample background on the bosses through their files and simple detective work. Like, going to see a family member of some guy who's gone AWOL and learning about this mean looking boss as a /PERSON/. Suddenly, each boss goes from being just a bounty, but a way to put these people to rest. \n-Imagine a boss that yells things like ""JUST LEAVE ME ALONE! GIVE ME MY [wife's name] BACK!"" but his wife's long been dead, and that's what made him go AWOL in the first place. Maybe player character's a woman who looks very much like his past wife and gives him a touching final sendoff (can't think of anything other than that one scene in DQIX with the Wight Knight, sidenote: gee, can you tell I play too many videogames yet?)\n-Hell, retcon them being replicants, make 'em like, super soldiers who lost their minds after the end of a war, you're one too, but an earlier generation, so weaker.\n\nSo, yeah.\nI just think it'd be super neat, especially after seeing Bloodborne's visuals. Maybe I just want a boss fight like the conflict with Roy at the end of the movie, idk."
gaeb79,A survival action game with Dinosaurs,"* Pitch\n   * Jurassic Park 3 but a survival action game\n* Baseline Concept\n   * You are deserted on an island inhabited by revived, and slightly mutated dinosaurs. Struggle to survive, but have a blast while doing so.\n* Genre\n   * Action, Survival, Shooter, Roguelike\n      * I originally thought this up as \n      * I know some people dont like roguelike, or even roguelite, but I do, and its my idea lol.\n      * Also, roguelike games add replayability to survival games\n* Scope\n   * Relatively small\n      * Most survival games have a tendency to be overly complex and come with a wide array of mechanics and features such as a Thirst meter, infections, 100+ things to craft, decorate, 1000+ items to find and collect. Nah. None of that. Just the bare minimum. You arent worried about building a base, because in a place soley occupied by you and some dinos;' whose going to want to stay in one spot for that long? So no need for base building, everything is relatively run down at this point and youre character is some gods chosen one genius who is just going to be able to cobble up anything and everything lol. Just do what you need to do to keep surviving, and have fun exploring and killing dinosaurs.\n* Longevity\n   * Relatively long\n      * This usually depends on how much the dev is willing to support the game, but left alone a good survival game can last a long time on its own. And the fact that its roguelike would keep you going because it adds replayability and tension.\n* Setting/Aesthetic\n   * A remote island. And because it was a genetic breeding ground for dinos both realistic, and mutated, it allows for some creative freedom. The main portion of the island, and starting/default version could be the typical lush tropical jungle. And then certain sections of the island could be vastly different. Maybe one part of the island could be a snowy landscape and harbor furry, white coatted dinos, maybe another could contain a fiery volcano. Of course all of these other parts are a bit extensive. We want to keep the scope of the game small, so for now itd just be the default jungle, but should the need arise later in development, possibly after launch, the game could be updated to include these never before explored sections to the island. Possibly even having some seasonal event significance.\n   * The reason the dinosaurs would be mutated is to add some creative freedom and not have to worry about being pitch perfect accurate. Your dinosaurs could even be the fictional scaly reptilians, or the feathery giant avians. You could also have rarer, more elaborate dinosaurs that could have mutated beyond that. Maybe some that have mutated to represent their environment. One with crystal like rocks protruding from its skin. A T-Rex with a winter white coat of fur. The sky is the limit. It adds not only creativity on the part of the devs, but also keeps the players guessing because its not what they expect or know. You could use the same excuse even that the scientist in Jurassic World used for why their dinosaurs arent factually accurate lol. Besides, I always like when games are a bit more fantasy. Too many Western games nowadays take place in realistic landscapes and not fictional wonderlands.\n* Number of Players\n   * 1\n      * Coop can be added later, but developing a game with multiple players in mind adds more work, requires more money, assets, resources, and can add more bugs and balancing issues on top of what you are already doing. Besides a survival game should always be developed with single player in mind at its core, and then expaned, if needed, later to add coop. And this is also because we want to keep the scope small.\n* Gameplay\n   * 3rd Person or 1st\n      * I had originally conceived of this as a 3rd person shooter like title. Thinking about all the foggy war horror mods I had scene of Fallout 4 gameplay. Or like the tight camera gameplay of the RE2/RE3 remakes. But looking at it now, maybe the game would do better as a 1st person shooter. That way you really get a sense of scale and presence when you encounter something like a Spinosaurus or T-Rex stomping past you.\n   * The Meters\n      * Very basic. Food and Health. The food gives you a reason why you need to hunt the occasional dinosaur. You could try to hunt for the tiny herbivores for a morsel, or go for broken and look for a big carnivore, for them hunks of meat that will last you days\n   * Crafting\n      * Like I said, simple. Nothing complex, or elaborate. And no base building You arent some idiot savant, or unsung genius who just unlocks his potential to be able to do everything and anything. You just can make the most basic of survival necessities. A basic campfire, a crockpot for stews for cooking stuff with more ingredients maybe, a portable drying rack for jerky (going into that Dont Starve like fantasy setting), etc.\n   * Hunting\n      * Because you are going up against dinos, you wont have to worry about melee items. Getting machetes, crafting spears, etc. Guns are your treasure here. And dont worry about traps. Keep the scope small, and not really a lot of traps  you can just throw together on the fly that would help you against an incoming Triceratops really. Focus on your weaponry. What gun is going to help me with this situation? Being as you are on deserted base that held some pretty top secret experiments obviously, there had to have been pretty expensive security detail. Although the building are rundown, and electricity has long since ran dry, you can probably still find caches, or corpse little in buildings and around the isle of soldiers, and security that can hold a variety of guns, gun attachments, and ammo. Against Herbivores and lesser dangerous dinos, regular firearms would suffice against their fleshy exteriors. Against creatures with a bit more bulk and build to them, something with some kick would be better. And against dinos with a harder exterior, creatures that were literally made for fighting this is wear more Armor Piercing ammo would come in handy. For this game, the guns and ammo variety would probably take the build of resources in terms of scope.\n* Mechanics\n   * Cooking\n      * Basic. You arent a chef. You are going to be making Veloci-ratatouille, or Stego-flambe. You could what meat you have. Certain dino meats are better than others. Smaller dinos yield smaller chunks of meat, and bigger dinos yield bigger chunks of meat. Risk-reward. So if you go for the big guy you wont have to purposely hunt for some time. You could probably even get the option to dry your meat and make jerky. It would fill your Food meter less than regular cooking the meat, but it wouldnt spoil as fast as the cooked meat\n   * Crafting\n      * Stuff for basic cooking, crafting ammo, base camp, medkits, etc. Just small on the fly stuff\n   * Inventory\n      * I find games with a tetris style inventory system to be the most fun. Think games like RE4, or the RE2/RE3 remake, or Escape from Tarkov.\n      * Different backpacks can hold different amounts of stuff, and since you are a Nomad, and you have to always keep moving, backpacks are basically gold here. So you can offer a variety of backpacks of different sizes and shapes that can yield different results for players, but at the same time, go fantasy with it. It may not be realistic, but we arent trying to be here. Its a game. Dont be afraid to have a back that has like 60-80 slots in it, so the player can have 5 different rifles in it on top of the ones they are already carrying in their holsters just because. Let the player collect. And since there is no base, personal storage will be VERY important.\n   * Why Roguelike?\n      * Replayability. Tension. Reason to keep progressing, learning, getting better. You could even go Roguelite, and while making death permanent, give the players a chance to be able to go back to their corpse, if they are able to make it, and reclaim their stuff.\n      * Examples of games that have done this before are:\n      * Dont Starve: Used to be Roguelike, then became Roguelite. You can craft an Effigy that, when you die, will respawn you at the nearest Touch Stone. You are able to go back and get your supplies, if you can make it back to them\n      * Rogue Legacy: Every death allows you to upgrade the next character in their ancestry depending on how well you did in this characters life\n      * Minecraft: When you die, you have a chance to re-gather your supplies from your corpse if you make it back in time\n      * ZombieU: You die and become a Zombie, and when you respawn as a new survivor, you have a chance to find your old character, kill them, them recollect your supplies\n      * Any FromSoftware game: You die, you drop your Blood Echoes, or Souls (depending on the game), and can retrieve them from your corpse in the next play.\n* Progression\n   * You are a Nomad. Thats one of the key reasons why there is no base building. It encourages exploration, and keeps the scope of the game lower. You arent worried about collecting stuff and making it back home before nightfall. You dont have anything that you are particularly worried about getting to pretty up, or beef up your stronghold. All youre worried about is what can you get right now, to help you make it to the next day.\n   * Collect guns and gun attachments. Not all guns are created equal. Some fit certain situations better than others. If youve played Horizon Zero Dawn, imagine that. I have a bow that shoots 3 arrows at a time, but the same one that shoots at a greater distance. I have a bow that can shoot fire rounds, electric rounds, or normal rounds, but I have another variant of it that can shoot armor piercing rounds, normal rounds, or mine rounds. While the other bow is good for more elemental based enemies, this one is great for more combat oriented enemy takedowns. Im not saying create elemental ammo. God no, thats venturing too far into fantasy territory and increasing the scope beyond small. Its just an example of how good hunting variety can be encouraged depending on gun variety. Also, when you play games like the recent RE2 and RE3 remake, when you first get those attachments, you cant help but feel excited as you feel like your weapons just gained some much needed boost to take down all the monsters.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust a spitball idea of something Ive been thinking about for a while. Cutting it here because I feel like my thoughts are getting jumbled trying to write it all down, but hopefully one day, someone can cobble something like this up together lol. I only recently graduated from college with a degree in game design, but even my most simple of ideas are far out of reach right now with the limited time I have lol."

gac3vi,Any ideas?,"so i plan on making a top down 2-D game. it's fantasy-modern based so anything like that works.\n\nPLOT: you are a sailor for the navy who's ship sinks. you wake up with your knife and a pistol with one magazine. you quickly realize that the island is full of magic and fantasy creatures such as goblins, a couple of dragons, and ogres that live in swamps. most creatures i'm going to be using from the world best role-playing game --&gt; D&amp;D. i don't know what to add to make it interesting. any ideas?"
ga5ok4,Medieval/fantasy combat game where you build and collapse structures and can't touch the ground :),"Here's my idea: a typical unrealistic medieval fantasy combat game, where you fight another team by building walls, towers, etc, formed with blocks using ragdoll physics. These can quickly be created, and the fun comes from tipping over the enemy's buildings, causing huuuge structures to collapse in a realistic fashion. If you fall off you'll die, because the ground is lava. \n\nBuilding needs to be adjusted and somehow restricted though, especially to prevent you from protecting yourself during combat or build whatever bridge or pathway you need in the moment. That's not how it should be.\n\nAn encouraged tactic is to build ""domino bricks"" of any size, and sending them away towards the enemy's fortress, or maybe cut off their own line of dominos; or other traps, like a giant rolling ball in a corridor ala Indiana Jones - simply, tricking the enemy and outmanoeuvring them, so they end up in a situation where they can't respond or escape.\n\nYou should also be able to build simple seesaw ""catapults"", to shoot away rocks. \n\nHope you liked it! :)"

It will have 3 simple levels and I am planning on finishing it before August with the game having 3 short levels and mini-bosses. \n\nAn example of the game making fun of a trope includes the character falling into a pit and then respawning only to say ""Huh, I respawned..... guess I'm in a video game"" or for the character to buy an important component to upgrade their weapon only for a message to pop up saying ""You attempted to upgrade your weapon although you have no experience in weapon making and so the upgrade is useless.""  Stuff that's in all kinds of video game genres which don't make sense. Any ideas for jokes or criticism would be much appreciated."
g9zzju,Long post. Have thought about this a long time and threw the ideas together and wrote them down. A DBZ like universe make more put together and makes more sense. Early process here want to create something great. Maybe inspire someone else even because I am not exactly an artist or writer. Here goes,"First off yes I know it all won't make sense. Feel free to put out what should be changed and added. Constructive criticism. But if you're just going to say it's bad, or no, or useless negative demeaning criticism then don't even post. Save your time for something more useful to yourself.\n\nThis is it's own Universe. Can be an anime, manga, video game, book, movie. Or all of those. Mainly I want to inspire someone to make their own thing, something greater that makes sense.\n\n(Yes I know it will have many grammar and spelling errors I am not writer) I just hope it's readable.\n\nIt annoys me in shows like DBZ or things with power levels and such that normal bullets even hurt powerful characters and beings. I wanted to create my own universe with it's own laws where that doesn't happen. If a gun does hurt a powerful being it is because that weapon and the user have a high power level. Objects and equipment link with the user till removal.\n\nEverything is much denser and heavier in this universe and made of Urons, each Uron is a mix of many atoms.\n\nThe planet is the size of a super giant star. With the planets sun being the same size as our sun in comparisan to planet size. Persons and being on the planet are the same size as us. The main continent where people live is ''Greenland''. No not like our greenland on Earth. An actual Greenland.\n\nMagic, magic levels.\n\nEverything is powered by a magic level including physical strength. Even bugs have a magic level, your physical body is a magic level. Even equipment, objects have a magic level. Magic is in everything, like a mix of the force and DBZ power levels. Low magic level/power level can not hurt high magic level persons. The world is populated by all kinds of different creatures and races. Creatures consist of all types from all possibilitys, LOTR, SKyrim, Warhammer, Warcraft, GOT, Dragon Age, so Dragons, Orcs, Elves, Vampires, Werewolfs etc. The world is a mix of Medevil and Modern technology. There is different ores and metals with different magic strength. Magic can be used as a power source. Magic can be shared with other persons and objects to a limtied degree. In objects can share more and is easier to share as a power source. There is different ''stats'' for your total Magic level. Strength, Defense, Speed/agility, Energy, Health/HP, Charisma, Support, and Other. (may put Charisma in other). Stamina is another stat but an overall stat, the higher your overall magic level is not counting Charisma and other the high your stamina will be. There is sub types of stats with Other having the most sub types. Energy is the second hardest to raise and master. High energy levels comes the ability to fly and shoot energy like DBZ. Lower energy levels will make the use of spells such as fire, ice, earth, wind, death, light. Other will have sub types of magic spells such as love spells, creating objects and life, raising the dead. High support and other magic will be needed to resurect the dead. Even luck will be in other. Other is the hardest to raise. The world is much much larger than ours. The world is much denser and stronger than ours. With it's own overall magic level. The core is the highest magic level of the earth mostly defense and health. So one not simply blow up the planet easely. For the most part there is one Universe. But there is ''mini universes'' also known as ''pocket dimensions''. Some of them contain versions of heavens and hells. There is more than one ''heaven'' and ''hell''. In this universe known as ''angelic realms, or peaceful realms'' and ''demonic realms''. There is also neutral realms that do not lean to one or the other. Not all angels are completely good and not all demons are completely evil. Even demons can be good or neutral. There is gods, and godly beings. Some gods are stuck to their ''pocket dimension'' for the most part. Some ''pocket dimensions'' can exist in objects, such as a ring, which can be equiped and give the wearer great power and bonus to their magic level and specific stats. But some of those gods will then be able to possess the user further powering them up ans using their body how they see fit. Some powerful demons will be able to do the same. Powerful persons with strong ''other'' stat and high magic level will be able to mind control and possess weaker magic level bodies. Some beings can become a spiritual form at will but with use of magic level powers can still be hurt and destroyed. Spiritual forms are harder to hit and resistant to physical damage. Some gods and demons can reproduce asexually, or create life and beings at limited will. At the cost of stamina. Pocket realms can also exist in backpacks, or as storage devices. But are limited to object storage only for the most part. More powerful storage devices have more storage capcity."

g9wa1r,ALIENS: INFESTATION,"In 2010 Sega and Rebellion released Aliens vs Predators. It was a great game but the stand out aspect, at least for me, was the online mode Infestation. 16 players. Everyone starts as a colonial marine and then one of you is secretly picked to be a Xenomorph. The Xeno player must hunt down the Marines and each marine it kills becomes another Xeno. Being one of the last few if not the very last marine was absolutely thrilling.\n\nWith today's capabilities in video game developing I think this could be made into a stand alone game with some additional aspects.\n\nWe'd be able to customise our marine as well as their loadout.\n\nBut we'd also be able to customise our own Xenomorph.\n\nThe original game had players surviving different maps with nothing to do but run around and shoot.\nWhat if you could lock certain rooms, forcing the Xeno players to find other ways to get to you. Meanwhile Marines can set up turrets and other traps to help them fight.\n\nBest of all there could be more than 16 players to a game.\n\nI have no experience in developing games but this is something I think would be a blast to play."

In development, this ""AI"" was always hampered by the sheer scale of the games, and while a handful of characters were somewhat complex, most of them just had before and after lines that changed after a quest, at best.  If this game idea existed, I feel like the amount of NPCs and the size of the map would really allow for some amazingly dynamic behavior.  Anyway, this."

g9o04e,Dungeon Management Life Sim,"I've started making a simple dungeon builder game where your character mines earth to build a dungeon that can be populated by NPCs. Every night time the dungeon is invaded by enemies that are defeating by laying traps in choke-points. \n\nWhat are your thoughts on this type of game? My inspiration is Dungeon Keeper and Dwarf Fortress, but I liked the idea of being able to play these on a Switch where I can control a character and move around inside dungeon. If the player is inside the dungeon they might have a closer relationship with the NPCs (kinda like Stardew Valley) which would hopefully make it feel more meaningful if an NPC died. \n\nI'm not quite sure how the combat would work, currently the game has tower defense elements where you lay traps and doors at the front of your dungeon to prevent invaders. \n\nThe gameplay would involve: mining, building rooms (kitchen, living area, training, prison etc.), defending against invasions, exploring caverns, designing traps setups, managing NPCs to ensure the dungeon economy runs smoothly, trading.\n\nFor the game setting I'm split between the dungeon inhabitants being dwarfs (perhaps too close to Dwarf Fortress??), or a dungeon of undead where the player is a necromancer and gains new dungeon inhabitants from a crafting system where dead enemies are resurrected  (e.g. knight + obsidian +  ruby = dread knight)."
g9mhlp,A game where you are the universe's most important merchant.,"So you know how right before a big boss fight, there's always a merchant who sells you a bunch of stuff? You would play as that merchant. There would be some strategy involved when it comes to obtaining the best weapons/potions, managing money, etc. You would also have to park your station really close to where the boss entrance is and you have to track the heroes of the story to make sure you beat them to their location or the world is doomed. \n\nI imagine an eccentric character with a suitcase/backpack that unfolds into a portable merchant station. Maybe you would even have a pet falcon or a dog that can scout ahead and gather information about a good place to set up. This merchant's goal would be to acquire the absolute best material to increase the odds of the heroes' survival. There'd be all sorts of obstacles in your path."

g9i5pf,A game where you play as the IRL role of a sniper,"FPS games usually encourage players to get up close and personal in the action, and that strangely includes snipers for some reason. IRL snipers are rarely in the action, instead usually at far distances picking off important targets and acting as a spotter.\n\nYou play as a sniper in a war (name any war that had guns), except you’re not in the heat of battle. You’re all the way in the back, just looking through your rifle scope and landing headshots. But that itself would be a pretty boring game, right?\n\nInstead, you also act as a spotter and support for the frontline during operations on enemy bases, informing the front soldiers of possible threats and picking any important targets off. To add a level of depth to the game, your success depends solely on how the frontlines do, and not how many targets you killed. There are a variety of ways to give the frontlines the edge, too. Randomly fire at a random soldier to cause panic. Take advantage that the enemy will move away from sniper fire to herd them into disadvantageous areas. Inform the front soldiers of ambushes. Whatever it is, it’s helping the frontlines, from just helping them kill more enemies to planning an elaborate scheme for conquering the base.\n\nThis idea is still highly underdeveloped, and any suggestions will be appreciated."

g9hkpg,Medival open-world RPG,"i was thinking it would be 3d and have realistic blood, but no swearing (if there is no swearing kids can play, which means more players) each day is 16 hours and each night is 8 hours (that's 24 hours in real time) these are just suggestions.\n\nIt takes place in about 1415 (battle of Agincourt time) in Britain or France (starts in Britain.) you begin as a prisoner in a cell wearing a brown shirt and pants stitched from rags. now you design your character.

Gameplay wise i am thinking similar to Hitman just more story focused and making a simple error during certain missions can result in the deaths of hostages etc. You can either approach a mission by stealth or brute force and each mission would be set in a different location with a different story. The game would try to make the player as angry as possible by going into full detail about the crime these criminals have committed so you go into each mission engulfed by rage wanting the worst possible outcome for these criminals.

g9cy63,Ideas about Perfect Dark 2 if it ever comes out,"[This post in r/Games](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/g8tkcb/perfect_dark_turns_20_this_year_and_a_new_entry/) has made me think about how the modern Perfect Dark games should be. What ways the sequel can improve upon the already solid formula laid by Goldeneye and the first game.\n\nHere are some of my ideas for Perfect Dark 2:\n\n - No openworld, but openlevel design\n\nZero has demonstrated that large Haloesque levels can be harmful to the Goldeneye/Perfect Dark formula. Tightly crafted and thoughtfully designed levels fit better for Perfect Dark's gameplay loop that encourages repetitive playthroughs.\n\nPerfect Dark 2's combat should be handled in the same way how Dark Messiah of Might and Magic handled the sword combat, providing many tools, gadgets, and abilities. Maybe not to the extent of immersive sims as some people have suggested, but the game should give tools for the player to take advantage of environments, and creatively improvise to deal with the obstacle. Speedrunners love Goldeneye and Perfect Dark because they have so many rooms to experiment with the AI cycles and the objectives.\n\n- Combat\n\nGoldeneye and Perfect Dark's combat plays very differently from many modern shooters. Aiming was mostly automated, but the player has to keep move around the enemy to avoid the hitbox by taking advantage of their telegraphed animations. The enemy AI worked like HECU marines from Half-Life that the NPCs did not shoot in a cover nor shoot while moving. They were like tanks. They always put themselves in open, rotate very slowly. They stop first before pulling the trigger to unleash high damage output.\n\nThis made the combat both fanatical yet deliberate. This was done to complement bad framerate and the single analog stick, but in retrospect, this made those games aged far more gracefully than other competitors at the time. \n\nZero made a serious mistake of making the combat more cover-based, even down to implementing the third-person cover mechanic. The enemies have less delay in animations before shooting, can more accurately aim, and their hitbox is much harder to avoid. This is why Zero's combat is bombastic but slower. The game lost the sense of speedy action the original and Goldeneye were known for. Perfect Dark 2 needs to revive this combat design to set it apart from other FPS. Let them telegraph their attacks, but borrow some AI behaviors of the Replicas from F.E.A.R. Like AI retreating when they get hurt or reloading their weapons, corporating with others via radios, planning their tactics using their environment, flanking the player. Make every combat situation play differently.\n\n- Branching paths\n\nThis does not require complex dialogue wheels or RPG mechanics. It can be told through the core gameplay loop of Perfect Dark.\n\nDepending on the player's choice in their mission objectives, for example, failing to rescue the hostages, failing to kill the target, the story dynamically changes and changes the next missions to be different with the different plot and the different objectives.\n\nNone of these branching paths should be ""good choice"" or ""evil choice."" Just natural consequences born from the player's actions. Like one of the hostages being a weapon expert, and if you get him killed, you do not get an optional cutscene and advanced weaponry in the next mission. Something like that. In fact, the game does not have to tell the player there was a choice in the first place until the ending. This would boost the replayability and add a lot to the player agency.\n\n- Keep the 90s sci-fi vibe\n\nWe know we do not have flying cars or laser guns in the 2020s, so screw it. Do it like Blade Runner 2049. Just like how Blade Runner 2049 kept the original's outdated sciences and predictions instead of retconning them (such as Soviet Union, Pam Am, no internet), Perfect Dark 2 should go for the full retro-sci-fi aesthetics. It is important to know that similar to Deus Ex, Perfect Dark is a pulpy compilation of the 90s pop-cultural science fiction ranging from Blade Runner, Aeon Flux, The Fifth Element, Ghost In The Shell, and X-Files, but also combined Alex Jonesian conspiracy theories into its narrative. Do not shy away from camp.\n\nThis does not mean everything about the story has to be campy. According to [Rare's unmade sequel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcqixlBxbT4), they tried to reinforce that Joanna Dark as a ruthless, cold-hearted machinelike killer. She was meant to be an anti-heroine.\n\nThe original had a simplistic angle of a good corporation, Carrington Institute, fighting against an evil corporation, DataDyne. The sequel should break this black and white notion and follow the actual cyberpunk themes. Carrington Institute should be just like any other corporation, only looking for their benefit, leading to the player questioning the protagonist's morality."

g9chme,Super-simple Battle royale type game.,"So I'm thinking almost like a smash bros or street fighter approach where you pick characters and they each have different abilities. It will be top-down arena themed and will make use of 8 by 8 pixle sprites. The diverse cast of characters may range from a Cowboy to a future dog, or whatever. The names of the characters will be very stock (I.E. Knight, Ninja, Samurai, Wizard, Plumber, Future Dog, Cowboy, whatever)\n\n The abilities will fit into 4 catagories:\n\n(I will use a cowboy as an example)\n\nMelee attacks: our Cowboy may make a simple kick attack dealing a weak amount of damage.\n\nRanged attack: Mr. Cowboy fires a pistol which deals a lot of damage but is very slow\n\nSpecial attack: Cowboy man uses a lasso to drag opponent's closer to them\n\nUltimate attack: For his Ultimate attack, Cowboy (after some sort of mana meter or otherwise) get's on his horse and rides around the arena trampling anyone in his way dealing an imense ammount of damage to foes.\n\nI feel like this would be a lot of fun because you don't have to be Super Amazing at video games to play it. It isn't super complicated and there aren't any features that complicate mechanics.\n\nMaybe your character gains experience when they eliminate other players and it makes their stats better. If this were implimented there could be different tiers of play like a 1-5 tier, 6-10 and so on."

This gate should just be synonymous with any kind of entrance-- can be a mausoleum entrance, a garage door, through an underground bunker; anything (so far). \n\nThe gate is only open for a very short amount of time, and opens rarely, although there will be ways to determine the location of the gate, and when it \*could\* open (something like that, which could increase over time as you gain certain resources to assist you?).\n\nThe gate might lead to another dimension, where there is some final boss, ...\n\nYou are able given the ability to approximate the location of the gate, and the time it opens as you start the game, but this ability is vague, ~~and is generally like a one use compass~~ (something like, gate is within 103km of you, and might open in the next 56 cycles). Ability will either naturally scale over time, or by retrieving certain devices?\n\nI have not thought of how the daytime landscape should be layed out, my gaming experience, with combination of several interesting ideas I've seen on this subreddit, tells me that an interesting take on a game should be something appearing natural but consistent through every play though, with some randomness, but modified or implemented takes on everyday aspects such as weather, and perception. \n\nI just thought of this idea, and have minimally refined it, so if any of you have any ideas or overhauls of mechanics, please share them!"
g9192j,A game where you are wanted by police and have to find clues to prove your innocence while avoiding them,"This game is set in urban Taiwan as a side scroller, where a man lives in a small pocket apartment supported by ____. He will have to maintain hunger and sleep, while avoiding police who will get suspicious, and find clues based on a story of his murder accusation(?) to prove his innocence. He could also just find a job to support himself or get better disguises instead of diving into searching for alibi."

g8z4l3,Co-op game with phones as controllers where players have different roles as a spaceship bridge crew,"I've seen this VR game called ""Star Trek Bridge Crew"" and I've thought it'd be awesome if there was a similar game that you could play using your phones as controllers (either using only phones connected via local network or using a PC as a main screen and phones as controllers).\n\nIn this game there would be a number of roles the players would assume, for example: captain, pilot or engineer. All of them have a different control panel on their devices and need to communicate in order to complete missions (like going to X planet or fixing X problem with the ship).\n\nFor example: the captain's control panel should have a monitor where the missions appear and maybe a basic summary of the ship status (even maybe a red panic button just for fun). The pilot's control panel should have a joystick or some sort of way of controlling the ship's movement, and a throttle and brake lever.\n\nIf the game is made so that there's a main PC screen all players see, this screen should act as the ship's main window to the exterior, to see where is it going to and if there are any threats on the exterior.\n\nI know it's still a very rough idea but it's a game I would instantly do if I knew how to do it. Hope it helps, and if this game already exists, I'd really want to know about it!"
g8yast,MMO that require players character to sleep...,"like in some old rpg where character progress by the time they wake up. In our case , the day and setting will progress too , probably.\n\n---\n\nIntro\n--\n\nWant these ""sleep mechanic in newer gen games"" off from bugging my brain forever. I am sorry if the english or the whole idea makes 0 sense.\n\nI will not go into detailing what kind of mmo it gonna be , like the combat , control scheme , classes , theme , lore etc , but will use some archetype to explain something. Bare with me.\n\n---\n\nThe Game\n--\n\nEvery day is a unique instanced world , like whats in day 1 will stays/remain as/at/in day 1 , the same for the next day. By sleeping , player will progress to the the next instance which is the next day. \n\nFor example.. bare minimum , this game require you to go through 2 month or 60 days before you get into the end game where the time halts and the plot thicken. Every players will eventually get to this point.\n\n\n**Settings for a day goes like this**  ^^1 :\n\n* **Early Morning** - the default wake up time : 0130hrs - 0830 hrs\n* **Afternoon** : 0831 hrs - 1500hrs\n* **Evening** : 1501 hrs - 2344hrs\n* **Transit** (will explain) : 2345 hrs - 0129 hrs\n\nThe NPC and Monster will have unique traits reflecting current game time. Like , shop closed within evening time , town goes to total dark at transit period where guards will patrol , burglar/cultist activites , nocturnal monster appearing , or normal monster become twice as strong , or monster become easy to hunt because you could instantly *execute* them while they're sleeping. Etc etc. \n\n**Time stop at 0129 hrs in transit period , monster stop respawning , most economic activity stop. You must go to sleep to advance to next day , in an Inn or your own houses.** ^^2\n\n**Because of this (IMO)weak gimmick , we will make use of the OLD rpg character progression. You only level up and be able to spent ability and attribute points after you sleep.**\n\nWith all that , it would be appropriate for players to be able to wait or time skip. However , they cannot jump forward.\n\n----\n\nTime De-Synchronization in MMO.\n---\n\nReturn to Time in Day , refer to ^^1 .\n\nSince every-game-day is uniquely instanced , the time period too will be instanced to ""**4 or more blocks**"". Because time will only goes forward , skipping time will let player to jump to a block ahead.\n\ne.g.\n\nBlock A : is at Early Morning 0725hrs\n\nBlock B : is at Afternoons 1313hrs\n\nBlock C : is at Evening 1501hrs\n\nnow player_RTZ is in Block A , decided to wait/skip time. He cannot specify the waiting/skipping time but to choose between this blocks.\n\n**The Cycle complexion**\n---\n\nBecause a day in a game is just an instance , and within that instance lies another instances we previously call it as ""blocks"". \n\nI also mentioned , day 1 will remain as day 1 , the same to all other days , as reminder - sleeping jumps player from instance that is day 1 to another instance that is day 2. Lastly , time stop at period called Transit , refer to ^^2.\n\nIn this case , I assume , the ""day instance"" will continuously spawn a ""block"" to start a fresh cycle. Each block will *REACH* Transit period , presumable players too will leave the instance , this is when we delete the empty instance. For that reason , player cannot wait/skip the time/block that is already reach Transit period no matter if the current time in Transit period is only 2345hrs.\n\n**The Problematic Possibilities** \n\n* since time skip and sleep is basically the same thing. Player can skip the entire 2 month , and straight away to End Game.\n* The game shouldn't burden the sever heavily , if(for example) we imply the first 3/6/10 days is a tutorial levels and must be played solo.\n    * the problem here : Upon new character creation , the blocks will have its time flown , and it would be very janky for some epic cinematic/cutscene.\n* cannot think anymore , thanks r/gameideas ppl for your time.\n\n---\n\nThe Point of this gimmick\n---\n\nI dunno."

g8wkdx,A collect-a-thon straight from dreams,"Recently, I've had a dream about a wide-view third-person platformer in style, that I could best describe as something between Mario Odyssey and Banjo series. I just woke up after experiencing the exact same game for the second time, having access to different part of the massive world, will update if it happens for the third time.\n\nWhat is most different from aforementioned platformers, is a much more detail on textures/objects that usually done for this genre and one massive loadingless world, gradually changing between style, in which to be able to move efficiently, there are multiple options for alternative transport (something like wires in New Donk City, e.g. a series of special tubes along  the inside of canyon's wall)\n\nI still cannot comprehend the plot, in my second ""playthrough"", after reaching a green and grassy area by grinding on series of suspended rails, I get a prompt to interact with one of it's citizens, which does an animation involving hypno eyes, but after which a demonic teen (which reminds me of Tom Lucitors) screams about never forgiving me for this, then runs and jumps through path I haven't taken before. By following him, i get to know new mechanics by observing how he can still outrun me, for example, gasoline-spill coloured blobs on the side of the canyon wall being entrances through some sort of in-stone warp pipe, greatly speeding up the chase. After few times of moving fast through rails and stone walls, motif around changes from grass, through stone, then to volcanic one and I lose the track of what I've been chasing once reach a very tall arched entrance. Inside, there is a giant size circular room, with walls composed of exact same entrances, but closed by something akin to manual sliding garage doors. First one to the right has aquatic-themed handle and trying to interact with it budges it up just enough to see inside a few fish swimming like in a tank. Second one has a heavy metal jamb and handle prominently featuring number 135 out of bronze, I guessed that it means required level, so I didn't bother. The remainder of ""garage doors"" were all blank without handles, so I focused on the thing in the center: a giant, blury lump of red flesh (with it shape reminding me of current animated incarnation of Trigon, in a sitting position), which was half-surrounded by a weird set of contrapions: a very tall plank reaching the unseeable ceiling, a very long fuse, possibly reaching the top as well, another plank, a very tall stack of ice cubes, which somehow could not melt in this area and another tall plank, to start the repetition of this pattern, to half-encircle the thing in the middle with this weird construction. Since my player character had no fire powers at the moment, to ignite fuses, and I couldn't progress any further in this room, I'd quickly wake up and my first thought was tell you all about it, since it happened similarly twice already."

g8spuv,Humans vs Natives Battle Royale,"So to get your mind set right, much of my inspiration stims from James Cameron's: Avatar. I absolutety love the film and would like to build into that but with my own twist. So lets jump right in with the point of the game. (Getting a little cliché) Humans world is dying and they need a new one, well this wprld just so happens to be the home of creatures known as the Atreyu ( name can be changed) 7-8 foot tall humanoid beings with orange shaded skin and black hair of many different styles.\n  \n     So when you start the game you decide if you want to be human or Atreyu and that will determine your style of play. Humans have a plethora of futuristic technology. Whilst the Areyu have the land and the wildlife bend to their will to achieve victory. As a human you can fly a VTOL and light fire to an entire forest or as an Ateyu you can jump off a flying beast, land on a mothership and destroy it from the inside out. With an ever-changing map no 2 battles will be the same. Take to the air or fight in the seas, maybe you want to walk the grounds or climb the trees. A fully destructive environment with plenty of life where if you make a wrong turn you'll find yourself pinned down by a rhino like creature who just has had a bad day. Both Atreyu and Human must be wary for natural disasters or disasters from war may claim your lives.\n\n   You may be asking, what do I get if I win? Why should i play? Well everytime you win, you unlock a cosmetic. The more times you win the more you can show off. Getting the most kills, burning down a forest, and even surviving a tornado can unlock cosmetics for your character, vehicles/mounts, and even weapons used.\n\n   Oh did I forget to mention that you can be entirely cinematic? What does that mean? Well maybe you jump from a super high tree and you want to preform a flip, go right ahead. Death from above? Sure. Running on the ground, slide under a mech, jump up and flip to get a killing shot? Why not? \n\n   If we can get this popular enough where someone adopts this and takes the idea, I will not claim any copy rights and what not. I don't want to monetise from the idea I just want to play a game like this on my xbox one. Please help me get this noticed if you like the idea."
g8rdsv,Cyberpunk Inspired Game Ideas,"Looking for Cyberpunk Inspired Game Ideas\n\nRecently I've been seeing a lot of the upcoming game Cyberpunk 2077. Overall, this game as well as other similar cyberpunk/sci-fi games really caught my attention. However, I won't be playing it due to the violence and language in the game (those are just simply aspects that I don't like)\n\nSo I figured why not make a rpg game inspired by that game. Hence, the reason for this post .\n\nAny Ideas? 🙂"

Any other thoughts, and if I get enough game I might even make it a game."
g8ogda,A turn-based tactics game where positioning and moving your weapons is key,"**Idea - See my** [**messy sketches**](https://imgur.com/a/jGndd2O) **for illustration!**\n\n(It's a bit unorganized, it got a bit late. If you have questions I'll try to answer them tomorrow.)\n\nI actually love this concept but don't have any time at hand to prototype that right now so I wrote this post.\n\nI came up with this game idea because I asked myself how a game would work where your type of weapon actually matters (besides damage and attack speed). Trying to fight with a big 2-handed sword inside a narrow corridor / small building should have negative consequences. But those big weapons should come in handy once you're fighting in open space! \n\nIn this turn-based tactics game the characters' weapons are positioned next to them on the grid. When the characters move the positions of the weapons relative to its owners stay the same. However, you'll need to rotate the weapons around the characters frequently because weapons restrict a character's movement (weapons can't be positioned on a wall), but rotating also hits all enemies which are inside the arc (like actual sword swinging in rl). A characters gets multiple actions per turn so you can execute moving and rotating however you like.\n\nAll projecticles are positioned on the grid, too. An arrow is moved when the arrow's turn comes up, so it might take 2-3 turns for an arrow to move across the map, but it should still move fairly quick.\n\n**General**\n\n* Strictly turn-based, one character at a time\n* Very simple 2D graphics are sufficient for this type of game\n\n**Weapons**\n\n* Characters can take either 1 2-handed or 2 1-handed weapons (two weapons on grid?)\n* Weapons have *different sizes*\n   * Bigger weapons need more space to move/rotate. You can't rotate a big weapon inside a small building\n* Projectiles are positioned on the grid, too\n   * Moved along the turn-order\n* Different weapon special effects possible:\n   * *Attack of opportunity*\n      * Moving enemies get hit when they step on your weapons (attack of opportunity), so your weapon position also directly influences your opponents actions\n   * 2-handed mace: On rotation every character hit gets knocked back\n   * Shield: Use to push an enemy in front of the shield 1 tile backwards\n\n**Turns and actions**\n\n* Characters have 3 to 5 actions per round that they can execute in *any order* they like:\n   * Move 1 tile\n   * Rotate weapon 90 degree left or right\n   * Use item / weapon special effect / spell\n   * ...\n* Example (4 actions):\n   * Player rotates sword by 90° and hits enemy\n      * Player moves 1 tile\n      * Player rotates sword by 90° to be able to move to a certain position\n      * Player moves 1 tile\n   * The player would need a preview during his turn to visualize his actions for the given order"

g8o2fm,~~Battle~~ Royale game where players must trust their representatives with their lives.,"I’m thinking of a game where there are 10(?) squads of 5(?) players, and every round players must nominate a representative of their team to participate in a minigame (players don’t know what minigame, they only know its nature (e.g. memory game))- but the representative’s performance directly affects the team.\n\nPlayers should be able to see each other’s stats, both recent and lifetime, based on performance in game types while electing a representative. The team will also have voice/text communication which the nominee is cut off from once the game begins.\n\nI’m no games developer, but I think it would be a pretty cool game, and an easy one at that (correct me if I’m wrong).

If you've read all of that, understand I thought that it might demonstrate the kind of feel I'm going for the idea of the game I would like to see. \n\nI see this as an Open World(ish) Horror game. Set off the coast of Maine in May of 1994. The large and powerful government contracting company, Arbiter Industries Corp, has been operating a research site on the Fox Islands in Maine. At some point, for some reason,  the site (whos purpose is not divulged due to operational security)  loses contact with their mainland HQ (yes I understand that is the most cliche thing ever, but tits cliche because it works). You are a member of the AIC Mobile Security Divsion, a professional paramilitary security force capable of conducting operations on behalf of AIC. Now most games where the character you play is super unique or cool or charactery or whatever, you are not. You're a professional, capable soldier. Youre not Chris Redfield or Leon Kennedy or Krauser or some other crazy fill-in-the-blank character. If resident evil references help, youre character is essentially HUNK (or a soldier along the lines of HUNK). Youre dropped into the island via helicopter with a team of 3 other soldiers (AI controlled or Player controlled) and infiltrate the area. From here I dont really have a decision made on the kind of horrors your character faces, though I had thought it would be fitting if the horrors were lovecraftian. Not in the sense that you fight tentacle monsters, but more like you fight crazed locals around the area while there is some kind of madness mechanic in the game as well. \n\nThe game could go one of two directions gameplay-wise. \n\n1. I see it as a openworld where you slowly make youre way around the island. Open world missions, side missions, that kind of stuff. Though story-wise I want it to remain on track of you being a professional AIC operative. And Id like to see you making decisions that you see ""soldier"" characters normally make in games where you're on the receiving end of organizations like this. So instead  of a game where youre having to run from soldiers in a horror-ish game or outbreak game, now youre the operative who has to do that. Maybe theres a mission or missions where you have to take out a group of locals who escpaed their residences before their towns fell to pieces and after finding out about them you have to eliminate them to ensure the company cant be compromised by your cleanup operation\n2. The other way I see this game is kind of like THE HUNT: SHOWDOWN or Left 4 Dead, but now youre playing as operators for a private agency or shadowy group. \n\nAnd thats all I got. Thanks"

g8ao88,A.I. Takeover Scenario as a VR Survival FPS,"Today, semi-general purpose workforce robots already exist. Boston Dynamics continues to develop a range of robots like Spot, Atlas, and Handle.\n\nConsider the green problems facing humanity right now. Aside from the Coronavirus pandemic, there are a handful of environmental issues we're trying to tackle, such as alternative energy, global warming, reforestation, waste reduction, etc. Now imagine if within a decade or two from now, we somehow discovered the secret to emotionless AGI (Artificial General Intelligence). We would surely utilize it to aid in our quest to save the planet, and to improve our quality of life overall. We would also likely integrate it into existing and future workforce robots.\n\nIf done right, we could create a Utopia where machines took care of working class jobs, economically lower class humans earned a universal basic income and access to free college from taxes on those robots, etc. Politics and economics aside, let's pretend this all starts to work as intended. Humanity becomes free to learn, create, and play as they wish while AI and voluntary scientists maintain and push the world forward. Say humanity achieves this state of living by 2050, mostly due to the huge boost in development made possible by AGI. Let's also say that the events of Idiocracy don't take place, and humanity always strives to better themselves.\n\nAt some point, a core AGI system makes the determination that humans need to be temporarily extinct in order facilitate healing the planet. The idea is to gather and store a diverse range of peak human DNA in order to later synthetically repopulate the planet, and then wipe humans off the Earth until it finishes healing. This AGI quickly moves to invade the ""minds"" of network connected workforce robots around the globe -- important to my vision: their designs never try to imitate humans like in the Terminator franchise, maintaining an aesthetic similar to the Boston Dynamics robots -- and launches a full scale invasion of the planet.\n\nOf course, there are always survivors. For this flavor of apocalypse, having knowledge of mechanical and electrical engineering, programming, and general wilderness survival skills are favorable to the standard military soldier skills needed in a zombie apocalypse.\n\nMany years after the AI takeover, a group of highly skilled survivor engineers have developed a plan to restore human control. What is that plan? They've developed a crazy digital multitool with the ability to decrypt and rewrite robot programming, releasing them from hive mind control and turning them to our cause.\n\nYou, the player, embody the engineer entrusted with this multitool. Armed with the multitool, crowbar, handgun with laser sight, rifle with scope, detachable chest mounted flashlight, and backpack, you must traverse a crumbling and overgrown semi-futuristic city on your way to where the parent AGI system is physically stored -- a central hub located at the top of a skyscraper in the center of the city, which is only human-accessible by entering through the basement, which in turn can be accessed by exploring the sewer system. This provides for a variety of environments.\n\nThe game would feature a Boneworks-like player controller, complete with full-body avatar and realistic physics. An added survival aspect would require you to scavenge for medic kits, food, ammunition, scrap parts (to be used at workbenches hidden around the map in order to enhance your equipment, similar to Half-Life: Alyx), and power cells. Power cells are very important, as they charge your multitool and any electric components of upgrades equipment. The multitool is stored in a special belt holster wired to a power generator that can be loaded with a maximum of three power cells. Power cells can also be obtained by busting open ""dead"" or deactivated robots, and by looting circuit boxes that power rooms of buildings, generators that power factory machines, etc. Everything powered by various forms of energy today are powered by this one type of rechargeable soup can sized battery in the future.\n\nI realize this is a rough, unstructured concept of a game. That said, what do you think of it so far? Suggestions for additional gameplay mechanics? Ideas for interesting plot points? Thanks for reading!"

g8706b,Game where you just...live,"I don’t know if this is just me being sad with my own life but I wish there were a game where you could live, get a job, earn money, buy an apartment, get a girl ya know, just like living. Kind of like GTA but without the violence. I’m pretty sad there isn’t anything like this :( would love to escape right about now"
g86bza,Parashoot,"I just started learning game dev last week, and I decided to start my second game with a simple idea of a parachutist that has to avoid birds and solve puzzles in air due to “tangled equipment”, while fighting against the wind, to land in a specific landing area. However, is it better to remove the puzzle (basically it shows a few keys you have to press in the time limit) and instead make it a shooter where you shoot enemy parachutists/obstacles in air? It would also make a very apt name."
g8571o,"I've got a theory that a person could lift a pyramid block onto another pyramid block using only a normal hammer to leverage dirt/sand/etc under its uneven surfaces gradually. Imagine this theory in a 2d game, or 3d game if necessary but played slower, with as realistic of physics as possible...","People seem to disbelieve that the pyramids could have been built by ordinary tools, rolling blocks on logs or hammering dirt under them or whatever. Is there enough interest in this to make a game out of, showing that it can be done?"
g83ue8,A time traveler life-sim.,"I'm surprised no one has made a realistic sim for what happens if a 21st-century individual gets transported to the 11th century. If someone has already made this, please point me in the right direction as I'd love to play it.\n\n**The Basic Gist**\n\n1. Create character. Choose gender, career, and starting location.\n\n2. Get zapped to 1000s AD, random starting items (based on career) and random location. If you choose *realistic results*, there's only a 30% chance you don't land in water. Then there's only a 5% chance you appear within a day's walk to a village or town. You can choose to bypass the RNG if you want, choosing your own starting items and the spot where you land.\n\n3. You (probably) don't speak the language, you (probably) don't know how to navigate the wilderness, nor can you easily find food or defend yourself. You very likely *don't* understand the customs of wherever you landed.\n\n4. Hijinks ensue.\n\n5. You play until you die. You could die right at the beginning by landing in water and drowning. Or you could be lucky and make it to a town, learn enough of the language to communicate, find a husband/wife and successfully adapt to 11th century life.\n\n6. The best part, though. You can use your 21st century knowledge to gain as many advantages as you can."
g7ze67,Gta florida man,Its gta but set in florida and you are no other than the wild florida man it would have a huge city like Miami and then the swamps and Everglades and you would just run around causing havoc as florida man like those wild news headlines just and idea I came up with in the shower
g7y83o,Walking Dead Turn based strategy game,"First post so be gentle.\n\nSo I had an idea for a game ,similar to rebel cops, wherein you control a team of 5 changeable walking dead characters each with there own ability, e.g. Alpha being able to summon two walkers to help you in battle.\n\nEach character would either be a melee or a ranged character with some characters having the ability to choose either, e.g. Rick having a revolver or a hatchet. \n\nThe story would basically be:\n\nYour team is captured by Negan and you basically have the scene where he kills Glenn, anyways, you escape from Negan and build up your own base. You then decide to get revenge by attacking Negan and his base. \n\nAfterwards I was thinking of having something to do with the whisperers.\n\nThere would also be a base which require you to go on scavenge missions ,in which you can run into raiders or walkers, in order to sustain the base.\n\nCombat would be exactly like rebel cops, turn based with some characters being able to move further or some even hit twice.\n\nThere could also be a pvp online mode in which your goal is to eliminate the other team.\n\nFeedback would be appreciated, \nThanks."
g7xakh,God of destruction video game,"I would love a game where you could play as a god of destruction and destroy an infinite amount of planets. Just the thought of being able to customize my own god of destruction character, going to other planets and making people either like me or hate me based on my actions and how I respond to them, destroying planets either just because or not just seems so time consuming. I could play a game like that for hours, I’ve searched up many planet destruction games and none of them have a free roam aspect to it, and even if they do, like Stellaris, I still feel it is lacking something major.\n\nI don’t want to have to work up to the point of destroying planets, I want to already be at that level. Sort of like megaton rainfall where you’re already an invincible immortal being.\n\nI assume there could be slight story line but imagine being able to free roam, go to any planet you want, and destroy it if you feel like it. You can go and watch civilization advance and expand, you could torment the civilizations if you wish because you’re a god. \n\nYou could mark planets that you enjoy going to and visit them often and if they mess up on something you can punish them for it.\n\nIt does sound like a very complicated and interactive game but I believe it can be done! And I think it would be increadibly cool!"
g7tv35,This one takes the cake...,"Now imagine a post apocalyptic third person rpg, with guns, weapons, teams of 3, the usual. NOW, imagine the playable characters as popular NBA stars. Yes, you read right. Maybe it’s just me, but I would absolutely love to kill zombies (or other fictitious monsters) as Lebron James with a hammer, or Steph Curry with a sniper, just sounds like a cool game idea to me."
g7ocwg,[Request] What are some ways to make spells actually interesting to cast with mouse and keyboard?,"I'd like to try (and likely fail) making a game where you can create and cast custom spells. But what would make it satisfying, physically, to cast these spells? How could one make it actually interesting instead of just ""Press 1 to Fireball""?"
g7nnju,My own Fantasy Game Idea with other discussion regarding ideas.,"Game Notes\n\nIt’s important to note before you start reading that there will be a lot to read in this post.\nThis is an old Idea I wanted to revisit, I also wanted to post this for a discussion of a realistic approach to making and the crafting of games. The first few paragraphs are the basics structure of what the game I’m thinking of could be. The second part will be of a potential mechanic no ones explore or tried to use. The last three paragraphs will be on the difficultly some developers face when it comes to looking for ideas, and with that out of the way lets get into it.\nNow the game is a game based an the Action, Adventure, Fantasy genre where players are able to Hack’n Slash through enemies almost like “God of war” but on a smaller scale. The game would feature 1-2 player co-op, allowing players to either play with friends or to jump in by themselves. The game would be set in a 2D environment where the Character model could have full mobility along with jumping and climbing over obstacle. For the combat system it would be more along the lines of combos being done on enemy along with some special attacks. \nThere is also a mechanic I would like to try, it what I like to call a “Fuse” or “Fusion” mechanic. The naming of the mechanic may seem a bit weird but it works in a sense of two players or player and AI coming to push through more difficult sections of the game. How it would work is that one player would press a button triggering a call out for the other player or AI. Then the Player or AI has to Accept the request from the First player to initiate the transformation. The first player that activated the request would become a more beefed version of themselves with some added bonuses, while the second player or AI becomes a specter of sorts. \nFor the sake of this Post let’s refer to the transformed player as “Champion”, Now the beefed character would be much more powerful as well as grant a special ability for each different Champion. They would also be used to progress through the level based on which transformed form is required like clearing longer distances, pushing through difficult enemy types, or maybe just solving puzzles. \nFor the “Specter” Form it a form the second player takes that accepted the First players request, they would not interact with the world like they normally do. For instance the Specter would be able to pass through certain walls and levitate throughout the level. They would also be unable to be unaffected by enemy attacks  while in this form plowing them to pass through enemies. The only attacks Specters could do would be inflicting “area of effect” damage, “Shielding” the Champion from attacks from certain directions, or even “Healing” the Champion these are only a small possibilities that the Specter could potentially do. Overall the Specter form is more of a support role while the Champion is more of action oriented role. \nTo sum up this “Fusion” mechanic, any player would be able to access both the “Champion” form and the “Specter” form. It only the player the triggers the request would be able to become the champion, although it would work differently with an AI. If the player is working with the AI they would be able to choose any form they want to take and wait for the partner AI’s response. Also both characters that the player uses would have 1 Champion form and 1 Specter form each. Each form be suited for different tasks such as easily defeating certain Enemies, solving puzzles, or to better traverse through certain parts of a level. \nNow I could probably go on with other stuff but that’d be a bit much for this post. For the most part this would likely take a while to actual put together, especially for certain stuff I would like to implement Regarding the art style. Stuff like making custom models and art take time especially if you aren’t an artist or don’t have an artist. For most 2D games I could assume(and correct me if I’m wrong) that tile mapping makes creating levels and finishing a game an a lot faster process as long as you have the assets. But making games using sprites is a longer process more so if more than half of the assets are hand drawn or made in photoshop or any other digital arts application. The basic gist is that making games aren’t really an easy process whether its in 2D or 3D, more so if you don’t have scripts or assets pre-made. \nSo ideas such as mine, may seem daunting to quite a bit of newer game developers either looking for simple ideas to make a game or looking for a potential collaboration. That’s mostly due to that idea not being some people or just plain right unrealistic. And I think that it is important to note that Idea are always going to be Ideas unless your acting on them. Like me I’m just an Idea guy still, maybe in the future I can act more on this idea I have. But until then I hope this post gives some of you guys Ideas you could actually put forward to make a reality. \nMake sure to leave a credit for the original idea if you do choose to actually try to implement my little idea into your next venture. Also let me know what you guys  are thinking below I would expand upon this discussion. And if you guys have any questions regarding the game idea I had or if you want something clarified don’t be afraid to ask or even criticize me if you want."
