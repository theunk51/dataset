5p7vcq,You are a member of a virus protection program in a computer. A virus gets in and you have to fight it.,"Open-world. The circuit boards and stuff make up the landscape. The batteries are skyscrapers, those little lines are roads, ect. The virus protection program is like the police and a highly dangerous virus gets into the computer and you have to fight it."

5p7nx0,"A survival game, where climbing a snow-capped mountain is the goal.","A group of semi-experienced campers head into the Canadian wilderness seeking adventure. After agreeing to leave the established trails three days into the trek, the group loses their positioning on the map two days later. One camper volunteers to try and retrace the groups steps back to the trail, while the others set up camp. However, the camper gets only a half mile or so before hearing screams coming from the group's new campsite. As he runs back, the screaming stops. He reaches the camp, only to find the bodies of all of his friends, seemingly mauled by a bear or wolves. He is faced with a terrifying reality; he is all alone in the Canadian wilderness during the change from Autumn to Winter. He could try to find the trail last seen two days prior, with the possibility of getting lost in the endless woods. Or, he could attempt to climb Mt. (name here), the intimidating peak with a research lab near the top. It's far away, but he may be able to make it up there with preperation and training. The only problem is, the research post is only populated for 60 more days... And he's a 40 day hiking trip away... And that's without acclimatization training, tool building, and more.\n\nYou play as the surviving member of this group. You have 60 days to get to the outpost near the summit of the mountain. Any right minded person knows that you can't just climb a mountain without acclimatization training, tools, and the correct apparel. \n\nIn 60 days, you must avoid starvation, hypothermia and dehydration. Fend off predators, and fight off mother nature's treacherous tendencies. You must go from simple camper, to mountaineer in 60 days time, lest you be taken as another victim of the unforgiving wild."

5p5j2j,"Multiplayer exploration co-op ""hide and seek""","3d game with a randomly generated huge open world. At first it is only a 2 player game, each player spawns very far away and the goal (for both players) is simply to find the other player (so not really hide and seek). The world would be interesting enough to keep the players going. While trying to find the other player you may have the option to drop markers of some sort to help locate each other. They may also have the option to communicate with each other the entire time.\n\nOnce you've found eachother the game is over and the other player would be a permanent 'acquaintance' which you can add to your lobby at any time and have them play with you (spawn together) to help in future games. Except the catch is that every player in that game would have to find eachother at the same time to end that game. (So you may not always want to split up)\n\nA huge emphasis would be on the environment and world generator. It would have to function primarily as an exploration game except with an objective.\n\nAlso there could potentially be some sort of leveling system to increase player movement and such, maybe unlock better markers or even signals that can be seen from further away. Progression would be important to prevent the exploration from getting stale."

5p2lfx,"What can we learn from Undertale, and how can we adapt some of it's ideas to make games that explore morality in more nuance?","So after playing the heck out of Undertale, I started wondering more about why games have not explored morality in more nuance before (or more accurately why they have tried and failed). Undertale takes very simple graphics and gameplay and makes a fantastic game based solely on how character relationships change based on the player's choices. The choices are simple, kill or don't kill. Engage a character or ignore them. That's basically it. And yet this game manages to create a world so dynamic and emotional that it fully eclipses every other attempt at this before. Remember Fable or Bioshock? Is there something inherently difficult about tackling this subject that Undertale solves? Is it scripting every conceivable player action to have distinct effects that ripple throughout the game? Is it witty dialogue and real character development? Is it fantastic music that complements every environment and situation? Or is the game only good because it's a clever commentary on it's genre?\n\nI've seen people draw comparisons between Undertale and Spec Ops: The Line. The prime similarity of course being the blatant commentary their making on their respective genres. Spec Ops makes you kill a ton of people and then tells you you're awful for doing so, and that's because first person shooters on a whole don't give you a choice to not kill people. In fact, a lot of games don't give you that choice, and If they do, they don't make it an enticing or engaging option.\n\nSo what ideas can we muster to address this. What could we create that doesn't use morality as a tacky add on or as it's entire concept? How can we use it in ways that don't seek only to cleverly comment on game tropes or satirize their genre? \n\nAnd since this a game ideas subreddit, I'll share my idea for a game that tackles this issue. I'm imaging something that starts as a simple RPG, but depending on the way you play turns into something else. Say you kill the first few monsters you see, then the game will slowly transition into more of an action game with more and more challenging foes to kill. Say you engage the first few NPCs thoroughly (i.e explore all dialogue options, don't skip over text, complete side quests, ect..) then you will be able to talk to more NPCs and develop more character relationships. Say you avoid both of those things, then maybe the game turns more into a puzzle / platformer type game.\n"
5p24nq,Game idea for a multiplayer soccer game!,"Last night I had this idea for a new soccer game, like the ones we are familiar with, like FIFA and Pro Evolution - but in multiplayer! Just imagine this:\n\nImagine a multiplayer soccer game, where each of the 10 players from each team (excluding the goalkeepers to make the game more fair) are controlled, individually by one and only real user! That means that when you join the game and the game starts and you are say, MARCELO you remain MARCELO for the rest of the game, seeing and playing the game from MARCELO's field of view! (of course you can be able to change the camera so that you can see the whole match if you want to). So, basically you can play as this individual player, preferably looking from his own perspective (1st or 2nd point of view - also great for a VR experience), and using your controller or keyboard you can perform all the variety of kicks and tricks that particular player can perform, while having to maintain your place in the game and cooperate with the 9 other players (also real people playing online) in your team (except the goalkeepers who should be AI to make the game more fair) to win the match!\n\nThe way this could work can be something like this: There can be various modes for online play...\n\nOne could be ranked, so when you join a server, depending on your level you randomly get a player from the defence of the selected team, but also have a little chance of playing as an attacker too. Later on, the more you achieve in the game you gain xp and you increase the possibility to play as an attacker, or a specific player like Cristiano Ronaldo. Of Course early on, in the game you will still have the chance of playing with Ronaldo but only a little one when your xp is low really early in the game. A second mode could be totally random, so you join a server and the server randomly chooses a player for you, regardless of the xp you have gained so far (but the same happens for all the other players too). And the third mode could be a dedicated server, where you have to be subscribed into a sort of online team, to be able to join in and play, and at this situation, the host of the game, points out a list of players for you to choose from. This will only work for teams that already know each other and they have a way to communicate and have already decided, which player is going to play which character in the game!\n\n\nWhat do you guys think?"
5p13v5,Clockwork Orange the Video Game?,"I'd imagine it as a beat'em-up/hack'n'slash based on the first part of the movie/book (before brain-washing), with ultraviolence meter, up to 4 players co-op and gory finishers. And how would you make a game out of this book/movie?"
5oys5i,Space Tycoon/RPG (Reign inspired),"This idea came to me in a dream and I just thought I'd share it.\n\nThe game would take place in a Giant Ship in the universe picture the Axiom in Wall-e. You play as a business owner on the ship selling. wares, but your end goal as a business owner is to own the ship. There would be other business owners as well fighting for possession of the ship. To buy the ship you must have enough money unless the ship has already been purchased in that case you would have to assassinate the current owner or buy the ship from them which would be pretty difficult.\n\nThe game would play as a single player RPG/Tycoon. I have pictured in my head Reign but with tycoon elements and more freedom in choices instead of 2 playing cards\n\nThe Art style could well as just pixels like StadewValley in my opinion, but it's honestly up to anyone.\n\nI just wanted to share with everyone to see if you guys thought it was as entertaining as I did. Thanks for reading :)"

5ov8ug,Earth Invaded (alien invasion survival game),"For a while i've been into survival games. ARK, Rust, and Miscreated.\nAll have a certain enemy, ARK dinosaurs and players. Rust has the savage community, and Miscreated being the mutants and players.\nBut the only game i have seen in the past 3 years that has had an alien enemy is Xcom (that is a survival game LIKE the ones mentioned above) What i see as a huge hole in the game industry could be filled with a team like Ark and Rust. What we need is a survival game where instead of zombies or other hostile AI we have Aliens that have invaded earth for a reason you must discover while fighting them and surviving the invasion.\n\n[THE GAME]\nSo it's pretty simple earth has been invaded and you are one of the last survivors left. (keep in mind i believe this would work as a MMO game too with other players for the real survival aspect of these types of games) You and other players can band together and form malitas or villages to survive this invasion. there would be the base building aspect where you have to make a base strong enough to survive constant alien attacks (and other players) as well as scut surrounding towns for loot weapons, and killing small groups of aliens for their technology. This in a summary is pretty much a zombie game with AI that is smart enough to hunt you down and kill you so you must be careful. Wrong move when a alien convoys and they will come down on you later with full force. \n\nAnother aspect to the game is the aliens technology. as mentioned above killing aliens as hard as that would be to start might reward you with one of their guns or a clue to the reason they attacked or on rare accation like this some secrets to how to craft their tech\n\n[Crafting]\nNow you will have access to almost every ""human"" blueprint in the game (this can be changed (i'm not making the game lol)) But alien tech blueprints can only be provided from killing aliens (better and stronger the aliens better and stronger gear) \nThis gives reason to attack their bases and convoys for gear and blueprints. Four basic materials, Wood, stone, metal and lastly the material the aliens use. (pretty much end game stuff)\n\n[Vehicles]\nAs the usual survival game goes they have some form of transport Ark with dinosaurs, and other games with cars and helicopters. \nThe Human tier cars would go civilian and military. the usual stuff like normal cars and armored jeeps. And then the rareish helicopters and planes.\nThen you get to the Badass stuff.\nAliens didn't walk here so they would have some vehicles of thier own. From spacecraft to hovering tanks they got the best guns and  wheels. This is another reason to attack convoys and shoot down UFO's.\n\n[Convoys and other events.]\nI've mentioned convoys a few times and now its time to explain them. they are the only Event that if this game gets made i would need to see in this game. its pretty much a large alien force moving through one side of the map to another, and the only way to know the next date is to find the information on a officer alien ( more on that later)\nThey have the ""some"" best loot and vehicles in the game but are heavily guarded and would take serious manpower to take down or stop. (maybe a punishment for letting it get through)\n\nAnother event i was thinking about was the mothership, the biggest and the only thing you cant take down but sure as hell can steal from. this would have the best loot. (i didn't think much on this so any ideas would be appreciated)\n\n[Different aliens] \nAs in most zombie games there are big daddys and little baddies.\nThis would be the same but in a sort of rank tier like army ranks \n(officers) told ya\nbut also heavy guys with big guns and LOTS of health\nIdeas about types are welcomed.[\n\n[Building more in depth]\n\ni do enjoy the rust building system so imma gonna go of it, as mentioned before 4 tiers of building and crafting (wood, stone, metal and alien tech) \nThis is to protect you from alien attacks to continue to wipe out humanity. they will come in small task forces at first but will grow as you grow. (but as i said if you make a noise around a convoy or  passing aliens it can and will attract more of them which would wipe small players out of the game. \n\n[PvP]\n\nAh yes the real draw of survival games the killing of other humans. \nthis is another reason to build up your base. raiding is another part of the game that game screw you over if you're not prepared. you can raid and be raided and its a good way to get loot. be warned if they have people on protecting their placed you will have a fight on your hands and if they have better gear then you you will have to look out\n\n\nOk thank you for looking at my idea for a game. please tell me if you like it or think i should add anything to this at all thank you and i hope to see this become a reality"
5otl17,Siege - A Medieval War Experience,"I have always loved learning about the medieval times. Peasantry, battles, knights in shining armor going head to head in battle, kings, queens, rivalries, and other things.\n\nThe idea has always been in my head for awhile: imagine a FPB, (first person battle), game. Two sides on a massive, sprawling landscape with a goal: to win. No flags to capture, no tokens to collect. Just you, the enemy, and a charge towards each other to decide who wins the battle. Calvary charges, sword fighting, shield bashing, just a big clusterfuck of players trying to kill each other. \n\n**Other Game Modes**: \n\n*Attack The Castle*: One side must destory a enemy castle, using strategy and precise ways of getting in and storming the base, with different ways of handling the situation and multiple attacking methods. The other side must defend the castle using strategies such as archers, catapults, fire, traps, and other methods to keep the attackers out. \n\n**Calvary Charge**: Both sides are equipped with horses and have to charge at each other by using tactics such as flanking, straight on head-to-head, and other methods of winning. One side wins when the other side lies dead.\n\n\n**Maps**\n\nI imagine large landscapes with open fields, some cliffs, urban forest, castle remains, and other places. Knights can charge at the enemy, use abilities, or flank the enemy with different places around the map.\n\n**Classes**\n\n*Knight, (typical soldier, has medium health).*\n\n*Calvary, (knight with horseback, increased agility but takes heavy damage if horse is killed).*\n\n*Marksmen, (soldiers equipped with longbows and crossbows, low health but small increase to agility, and is more useful when defended by soldiers).*\n\n\n**Abilities**\n\nWhen knights kill a significant amount of enemies, they can gain Abilities. These Abilities will help your army gain a foothold, but only for a limited time. Abilities end after a amount of time, (depending on how powerful it is), or ends when player dies. Abilities also depend on what game mode you play or what map it is.\n\n*Catapults: Player controls a catapult near the far side of the battle, able to launch rocks and other debris at the enemy. Ends after 60 seconds.*\n\n*Fire Arrows: Archers can shoot fire bolts, which results in the enemy being caught on fire. The fire can spread if surrounded by other soldiers, but cannot spread too far. Ends after 30 seconds.*\n\n*Tar, (only used in Attack The Castle mode): Soldiers defending the castle can spew black tar onto the enemy near the castle, killing them instantly. Lasts 30 seconds.*\n\n*Expert Marksman, (only for Archers): Your bow will be entirely accurate while looking at the enemy, and sway is reduced completely. Only lasts 30 seconds.*\n\n*Better Armor: Your armor is more heavily protected, leading to less damage when hit, and better shield blocking. Not invulnerable, however. Only lasts 30 seconds.*\n\n*Better Damage: Players are given more damage to their weapons, leading to better damage to enemies and shield bashing. Only lasts 30 seconds.*\n\n**Smaller Games**\n\nThis is meant for players who want to relax after fighting large battles. Most are only two player to four player only.\n\n*Joust: Two players get on horses and charge at each other with jousting swords. Winner is based entirely on luck and deceive sword aiming, loser is determined by falling off their horse.*\n\n*Arching: Up to four players compete in an arching competition. Winner is based off who hits closet to the center mark, while loser is based off who is the most off with their aiming.*\n\n**Campaign**: Following most games, I would think it would also have a campaign. The main character fights in battle with comrades who you get to know while fighting. I really didn't develop this idea too well, but I think the main character would fight a series of battles.\n\n***\n\nSo, that's my idea. Have any suggestions or other ideas? See something you might want to fix in my ideas? Constructive criticism? Let me know! Thanks for reading!  "

5on8e2,Feedback please - Tower defense mixed with RPG elements for desktop.,"I am developing a tower defense mixed with RPG elements and have a few videos of my progress so far as well as concepts in the works. \n\nGeneral idea: A tile based tower defense where you get 4 heroes that defend your king in addition to any towers you build. If the king dies you lose, heroes can move around the level to pickup chests that may unlock new items or towers (there are about 30 towers so far). You can have 4 of the same hero class or a combination of them. Each hero has its own unique spells and stats. Each level has 1-4 roads leading to the king so depending on the level you may want a different hero combination.\n\nHere are videos of what I currently have implemented, it's still in the early stages:\n\n[video 1: range indicator, spells, and heroes, some towers](https://youtu.be/wKA9xp_4N2U)\n\n[video 2: more heroes and spells](https://youtu.be/jVHCAMgrhEs)\n\n[video 3: making a level, possibly the start of a level editor](https://youtu.be/tih_7MTrB_A)\n\nHere are some screenshots of concepts in the works:\n\n[tower stats and leveling interface example](http://i762.photobucket.com/albums/xx267/FF7_Squirelman/fire%20example.png)\n\n[midas tower example](http://i762.photobucket.com/albums/xx267/FF7_Squirelman/midas%20example.png)\n\n[hero stats and leveling example](http://i762.photobucket.com/albums/xx267/FF7_Squirelman/hero%20example.png)\n\nHeroes and towers can level up and keep their levels permanently between levels, each level gives you a skill point that can be used in one of several stats such as lowering the cost of a tower, increasing damage, range, etc. Items can be purchased from the shop or found in chests to further customize heroes.\n\nThe main mode is story mode, it will probably have a minimal story though. Play through levels unlocking new hero classes, towers, and leveling. Anything you get in this mode can be used in the other modes.\n\nOther modes might include an endless mode which would be what the highscore is based on. possibly a level editor where you can make your own levels but playing them would just be for fun (no unlocks, highscore, etc.) Possibly a multiplayer teamwork mode but I haven't implemented multiplayer in any of my games before so it depends on how interested people are in the game and if I am able to figure out how to implement it.\n\nRight now a lot of the towers are too similiar some basicaly just looking different, but I intend to continue balancing them and changing them to make them more unique so people can try different combinations rather than being forced to just use a specific set of towers that are the best.\n\nSo if you like the idea and think it looks like it could be fun please comment. I am also still trying to think of a name for this, so far everything I have thought of is either already taken, terrible, or both so if you have any ideas for a name please suggest them! Also do you think that a tower defense should have some sort of limitation on where you can place towers or full freedom (aside from placing them in water or on the enemy path blocking them)?\n"

5ogilv,Persona - choose your own adventure,"I am making a game that will have the choice system of persona, but enough longevity to make your choices pan out.\n\n There are many CYOA games out there, but they usually pander to a God complex of (insert important role here)  playing God with (enter location or nation here). Personally I found this immersion breaking and doesn't treat the player like a human as much as a decision maker, while persona treats you like a human. \n\nThe game would give the player options between the age of 18-20, with some choices at the beginning of your life to change your initial stats. And of course what you decide to study and who you interact with will change things. \n\nI'll be able to make this possible by making it a weekly-timed system, meaning 52 choices every year, with a total of 100 total weeks approx. If I do what persona did with a school option and afternoon option, with the weekend having three options, then it'll equal out to about 270 choices including the choices you make from childhood to teenage level. \n\nThe game plays upon the discovery of new information in a world and the interaction you have with the NPC's in the world. It takes inspiration from the Knights of the old Republic series, persona, mass effect. Any game where talking to people is an intrinsic reward because they aren't there to push the plot, but because you really wanted to talk to them. Where learning about the world through experiences shapes them, your character, and you. \n\nWhat I like about the persona concept of relationship building is that the gameplay mechanic transcends any time period. It can take place in medieval times, cyberpunk, magical fantasy, modern, whatever. It could be world War II, renaissance, star wars (kotor), etc. \n\nThe coding I found is pretty easy given the program I'm using, with most scenarios  being determined by the time and the relationship level you have with a character. The graphics will personally be the last thing I care about, given the game shouldn't need good graphics. \n\nI'm going to make this game no matter what, I just wanted to here what you feel could be improved. Perhaps inspire someone else."
5ogbb1,An open world RPG in the vain of Oblivion but set in a College Campus and the player and NPC are LARPers.,
5ofgcr,A Blind Man's World - A Unique RPG,"**The Basic Plot**\n\n\nThe basic plot or concept of the game is that you are a man. A man with a family, a wife and a child. Your eyes are injured during a brutal car crash in the very beginning of the game. You must feel, smell, and hear your way around, and protect your family from the dangers around you. (*A bit of open-endedness right here for all of you - say, you could be as dark as murderers, or as simple as accidents.*)\n\n\n**The Core Mechanics**\n\n\nYou, the blind man, start in an area. You can move around, probably measured in tiles up or down. More than often, you can sense something, like feeling, smelling, or hearing. Then, you get a brief description of the object, and are told to decide what it is! For example, just a quick idea:\n\n\n*You try to move UP, but you FEEL something in front of you. It is WOODEN WITH SOMETHING LIKE A KNOB STICKING OUT. What do you think it is?*\n\n*A. Your Door*\n\n*B. Your Dresser*\n\n\nAfter you ""Decide"" what an object is, it appears right in front of you, in the area you tried to move. After this, you can attempt to interact with the object again.\n\n\n**CUSTOMIZING MY IDEA!**\n\n\nAfter reading the ""Why your Game idea sucks"" post, I realized that I should try and make it open-ended for you devs. Here are some things that *you* can decide!\n\n\n* The thing that you have to protect your family from.\n\n* The areas you explore!\n\n* All of the characters (Except the Blind Man).\n\n* Any other elements you can think of! (Combat, inventory, currency? You decide! I can't.)\n\n**EDITS**\n\n* One idea is to incorporate a puzzle element into the game as well.\n\n* No flavor text for walls.\n\n* Sounds instead of text descriptions for some if not many objects."
5n7qh4,"Create your own ""Choose your own Adventure""","This came up in a different post, but I figured I'd post about it properly as well.\n\nEssentially I'm thinking a web app where people can create CYOA games - though going a bit further than the typical railroad idea that you used to get. Pretty much I'm thinking somewhere halfway between a classic CYOA and a MUD or Adventure/Zork clone. I'm seeing quite a few CYOA games turning up on the Play store, so they seem to be back in fashion. It's also relatively easy to build them because the creative input is entirely text based. There's no need for graphics, or open worlds, or procgen anything. It's just simple narrative and wiring.\n\nBasically for V1 I'm thinking something like having a game be made from a number of scenes, where a scene has NPCs (Friendly or not), Loot, Secrets, Quest Hooks, etc. You create a game by creating all of the scenes and connecting them together, and then you play a game by creating a character and using it in the game. \n\nRules can be just D20 SRD or similar - would very easily give access to a decently usable ruleset, with items and monsters built in. It also gives support for character progression, which itself allows for the idea of a single character being played through an entire story arc instead of just one story, and also for the idea of a party of characters instead of just the one."
5n7i3f,Game Idea explained (Tales of the Forgotten),"So I was a bit vague last time so here we go.\nI had an idea for this game called Tales of the Forgotten after finishing FFXV, it would have the same combat idea as FFXV but without the warping, and a Follower system like it aswell(but I was also thinking about a Skyrim Follower system, get them at taverns, houses ect). \n\nFor the backstory idea, I give credit to mehmadness who posted this on my last post, I changed up a tad but I find it to be a good backstory.(Note, this is the backstory,I'm still gathering ideas for the story that follows, ideas are appreciated)..\n\nThere is the story of a forgotten land, buried beneath in politics and lies. A place considered greater than mankind itself. It had brought technological achievements and peace throughout the land. Yet, after it’s help for evolving the world for a greater good, the greed of men had decided to abuse the materials given by this godly Eden. Then, men started to get ill, the island corrupted man and turned them into monsters, sending the unwanted into hell for internal damnation. The rulers of the land then decided in this act of traitory to leave man and hide the Eden in a place never to be seen again by man. The world went into flames after the land had gone. The lies created by man to calm the situation started never ending wars. This led the poor to crime, prostitution. Many gave themselves in to the rich and became slaves. A world once hailed for its advancements quickly turned into a living hell. The world was chaos and it had managed to destroy itself in the process. After all of this terror and blood, man had finally decided to rebuild their home, make it what they believed it should be. But our new world isn’t constructed on peace and love, no. It is built the hatred and bloodshed,splitting the good and evil,rich and poor and the love we have for each other. You might believe our times are still peaceful, but you weren’t there when the land was still with us. When it left, it took man's  happiness with it, and we’ve only been trying to copy it with the lies we've made.\n\nAnd that's it really. In terms of content I would say my idea would be 20 hours+. Also one thing, I may never make this game. I have come up with character names and County names (When I agree on what I've picked I'll share) but this really is for anyone's interpretation. Feedback is always appreciated!"

5n3pdh,Some ideas for a couple week long game jams?,"Hi,\n\nI'm conducting a couple of game jams that each will take 7 days for the school I teach game dev at. So I was wondering if you guys want to contribute some ideas or themes or whatnot.\n\nGames will have to be 2D and their engine will highly likely be Game Maker Studio.\n\nIt's been a while since they've done anything serious and also they just learned game maker but they know Unity.\n\nAlso ideas should be short enough that can be made in like 4 days to have 2 days for extra stuff and final day for debugging.\n\nLet me know what you think."
5n3o1o,"Twisted Metal-style combat, with Arwing controls, with Gummiship-like customization.","Title pretty much says it all.\n\nImagine, Star Fox 64s' multiplayer combat mode.\nYou have arwing controls, in what that game calls ""all-range mode"". (whereas, throughout most of that game, you're on a fixed forward path until the boss triggers that mode.)\n\nI am writing a flight control script, that very much mimics Star Fox 64's linear flight with mouse-aim controls relative to your current forward path, and keyboard controls to fly around in the world space, changing that path.  \n\nI am fond of the Twisted Metal games, especially ""Rogue Trip"", all the same jazz though.\nIn THAT game, You can pick up power ups, each car has its own sort of ""Ultimate"" or ""Smash"" move, and in each match you get to save up your weapon pickups and cycle through them to use them.\n\nIn my idea, for this game, there wouldn't be individual selectable ships, but rather the player would customize their own ship, the base of it being made of your custom arrangement of basic shapes and having modular components to add weaponry, defenses, boost effectiveness, stuff like that, think ""Kerbal Space Program"" or ""Besiege"" in terms of how, visually, on your screen, you would be customizing your ship. \n\nThe simplicity of the core idea leaves room for more ideas, like possible game modes.\n\nHow do you a think the combat system in such a game would be best executed?\nUnlockable machine components?\nIn-match, temporary pickups and bonuses?\nLevel up your effectiveness in certain things like damage output or speed individually? \n\nAny input appreciated.\n\nHere's a prototype video for my controller:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJs9w4pBLCI\n\nRight now I'm working on, getting a cursor to determine the rotation of the ship relative to your forward motion. I've got it basically, just working out the kinks."
5n1iok,"Multiplayer, silent character, rude hostile slaying, gun blazing carnage type of game(with melee of course).","Short story summary:\n Some generic as heck(with potential future candidates taken into the equation) scientist makes a goof, by experimenting with the very recent field of dimension travel. The economy has been split into multiple forms of currency ranging from half official money-officiall print money (currently approved by greedy high ranking bastards that throw around money way to much and don't consider any negative outcomes), online currencies(which are fairing quite alright but offer you very little in the way of options if you're looking to use paper currency, as choosing to play by paper currency rules at this fantasied alternate bad scenario esque universe   can be hard due to all the troublesome unmonitored problems that has appeared)and more.\nThere is however a fraction of the population (a very tiny fraction at that) which has grown up independent of money as their predecessors had joined some self sustaining program and basically lived of of social trade with the people nearby, choosing to go with the flow and see what happens to the economy(either that or they just ignore it and go with their thing). As the times take a slow toll, not necessarily on economy but on respect and seriousness in sectors regarding multi million companies and any form of digitized system management, the state of society becomes more and more like ' i don't give a damn anymore but these people have a way to bribe other people into potentially doing rude stuff to my fellow neighboring people, so i just can't but be on my guard and sometimes occasionally attempt to fathom what the hell they're thinking'. \nAlthough it doesn't escalate to this point through a human war, the portal thing takes it to an equal or worse level as it's basically another bother in the bank but on a really really serious level( wars are of course also serious lol).\n\nThe protagonists/playable characters are metal mask wearing, muscular (or highly acrobatic) soldiers from these non economy zones who had pretty tranquil but rather isolated lives from a size standpoint. There wheren't necessarily any badass past involved in order to turn them into the often short worded persons they are. They basically had enough or felt a bad storm coming with the presence of large companies/powers crumbling from the inside due to built up slacking.The masks are basically some sort of creed thing they adapted because well, wouldn't you also agree that masks make things much more badass?  They have or eventually acquire (with you leveling up) combat abilities in order to fend of strange creatures coming from this portal (which eventually granted these creatures the ability to open more portals). They are not hell creatures or walking lizards or anything, they're more like some kind of human to dinosaur sized kaiju with humanoid,bipedal and all sorts of features.\nThe badass combat dudes call them nihilants as they seemed to have come out of nothing (although this is probably a religious term they still use it to describe the monsters, as they decided any spiritual literacy influence into name giving at the time was not really relevant to the tense situation).\n\nConcept:\n You play as these guys in groups of around maybe max 40 people holding off spots with lead,explosives and all sorts of scavenged high tech weaponry in a glorious carnage where some enemies mushy as hell and others are big bad hulking sponges of death. Your arsenal consists at first what resembles todays weaponry, but is later upgraded to more ridiculous big bored, big maged, body shunters. You level up and unlock skills both for the weapon you're using and for the weapon type. This includes perks, which also can prove useful in conjunction with perks for other weapons to create hybrid classes. You can also gain quirks which are unique to you or other players that choose them, such as being able to bring in more stuff than usual or being able to block a certain attack from a monster when using a melee weapon. There would also be fun stuff such as sentry guns, breach countermeasures, rage abilities that can turn you into the  marrow crushing dominant brawler of the fight for a moment and so on.\nThe goal is to eventually deal with the portals by first mitigating the wave of enemies and then use some anti portal device in order to bring down the portal. The average game length varies depending on what difficulty you play and how big of an objective it is.\nThe objectives are mostly played out through the group of characters communicating and deciding what to do next but occasionally there are some military contracts/requests involved.\n\nIts like a hybrid between payday and killing floor with tons of players on one server (and balanced). This middle ground however can be difficult to achieve and would certainly be prone to a strike of content limitations at this current day and age as far as i know.\n\nArt style/ atmosphere:\n real life basically? with some semi realistic touches and somewhat excessive shading in certain spots on badass characters, that will flick many switches on the most sensitive of people.\n\nOther notes:\n\n\n\nWould like to apologize for any grammar errors, my english is like drawing semi colons on knifes and sticking them into still alive pigs.\nagain, my apologies."
5n0kiz,How about this...,"A game that's like the movie ""Underworld"". However, not exactly. You can play as three different teams, werewolves, vampires, or humans. \n\nThere are different classes for each, there are 2+ (if you wish to add more) for the vampires and werewolves, and 4+ (if you wish to add more) for humans. \n\nThe werewolves' classes will be ""normal"" and ""brute"", brute will be more of a heavy type, slower, but deals a lot of damage and has more health. Normal is just like any werewolf you see in movies, but not as over powered. We want players to have a chance.\n\nThe vampires' classes are ""ghost"" and ""bat"". The ghost class are vampires that can turn invisible, but can't attack in that state, only move like normal, with a slight speed adjustment. The bat class have players turn into a bat and fly around, they can attack, but deal less damage than normally and have less health.\n\nHumans' classes are ""runner"", ""gunner"", ""psycho"", ""spec op"". Runners go by their name, they run, but they have more stamina than others. Gunners carry heavy weaponry, something like a LMG, nothing that big. Psychos are crazy (of course), they deal more damage with melee and have a damage resistance. Spec ops are basically trained military, they can dodge, attack fast, reload fast, etc. The downside is they can run out of stamina quick, and if they wear heavy armor, they go slower.\nLike all folklore and legends, werewolves and vampires ""eat"" people. They can grab human players and eat them. Werewolves brutally bite them and vampires suck their blood. If there are any survivors of being attacked like that, they have a chance of getting infected and turn, but they can bleed out. Even if they're infected or not. An indication of being infected would be the character acting different.\n\nYou can any weapon you want in the game.\n\nThere can be a campaign with 4 player co-op. If you want, you can three stories. The first story having a human protagonist, second has a vampire protagonist, and third has a werewolf protagonist.\nPlot and story is completely up to you.\n\nThis is all. I couldn't think of anything else that'll support my idea. I don't see much of games about werewolves, vampires, etc. I was trying to think of some fun cause usually, co-op is really fun to play with friends and multiplayer is something just for competitive purposes. I couldn't worded it better.I hope this idea is good and if it isn't... At least I tried."
5n08t5,Potato life.,A game about a potato.
5n07nn,Action management game styled like a Metroidvania,"The game will be a 2D Metroidvania with a twist. It takes place in a large castle, with several rooms. The character will play as a character tasked with rebuilding and protecting the castle from infinitely spawning demons. So how this works, every room needs to be cleared of demons and such. These fights will be difficult, but possible. After clearing a room, the character can build reinforcements on windows, doors, and other things like that. The character can also craft magical suits of armor to defend the room. each room, or most rooms, will have the corpse of an NPC. These NPC's can be resurrected with a resurrection potion that can be gathered from a procedurally generated dungeon that scales difficulty based on current NPC's alive. \n\nThe NPC's give perks, are shop keepers or unlock new abilities etc. Demons can kill these NPCs.\nSo the big part of this game is that everything is in real time. So while you are trying to clear a room, a room on the other side of the castle would be overrun and the NPC's killed. So the game will force you to always be on the move. Always checking rooms. I think the game will be hectic, and if you loose, the game is back to where you started. \n\nThe castle itself would be huge. With many, many rooms. Some with special effects if captured. I think there should be a gardens area which will serve as end game content, very difficult but rewarding."
5mz8l6,Need ideas for unique metroidvania ablities/game mechanics (2D),"As a side project I'm working on a 2D platformer. The idea is for it to be a metroidvania in the vein of Super Metroid and Symphony of the Night, as well as newer games such as Axiom Verge. The story is heavily WIP but as for gameplay currently I have implemented basic platforming, collision, as well as a prototype ability, a spear that can be thrown and used as a platform or ridden on mid-air (based on an old flash game called [Fishbane](http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/541803)).\n\nI'm looking for more unique/fun/whatever abilities that the player will not have initially and allow for map design in a way where certain areas can only be accessed after a certain upgrade has been acquired, and allow for those delicious metroidvania secrets. In addition, the abilities should be synergistic and not replace each other. For example, a flying ability would kind of render the spear ability pointless. So from other games I've seen mechanics that alter movement (high jump, or my spear), let you open new doors (missiles in Super Metroid), let you into new areas (Varia Suit in Super Metroid), let you break certain types of walls, new weapons, etc. Doesn't have to fit these guidelines, but somewhere to start.\n\nExamples from other games that I found very creative and interesting: \n\n* the Speed Booster from Super Metroid\n* the bat transformation from SotN\n* pretty much everything from Axiom Verge, specifically the drone and drone teleport abilities\n\nIf the story is important for the idea, a basic rundown is that the player is a character from a modern world traveling to a heaven-based realm where he has tracked his missing girlfriend. He encounters a corrupt heaven, fighting angel-things and demon-things (as I said, heavily WIP). So, abilities could be artifacts of the angels, such as was my idea for the spear, but really the mechanics should come first and I can build the story around them.\n\nAll ideas are appreciated!"
5my150,Is this a good way of thinking about game ideas?,"After reading and seeing videos and game dev and game ideas... I've come up with an idea about how to make game ideas\n\nThink of the graphics as player is ""1"" and the obstical or enemy is ""0""\n\nBasically kill the graphics for now... Is is engaging ...after a while will ur players get up and say ""wow let me tell my friends"" or will they think ""Why did i even waste 6hrs""\n\nOur medium .. the game design.. is a medium about making people do stuff the feel is fun... ""DO STUFF"".. if they wanted to watch an epic journey while pressing some buttons they should rather hold a remote control in front of a dvd no?\n\nBut then this kind of thinking fails if ur thinking about adventure games... people who just want to explore.. want to see some kind of awesome.. lore friendly... place tucked away somewhere,,, that is so marvelous they want to bring their friends there...but to do this the main world enviroment art mustn't be sacrificed\n\n\nThis is wht i think\n\nThoughts plz :)\n\nHave fun "

5msamx,Survival game based on Will Smith's I am a Legend?,"It could have a strong selling point as a walking simulator at first, gathering everyday materials and such but, then the night comes and this is where you get rekt hard.

Either the richer areas or the one towards the boundaries of Budapest. but then again, could be like Hawaii or like Malibu. Unusual settings that would give the player a feeling they've never got before, I mean, we've been to many places with what games could give us."

5mpju7,Asymmetrical 2 player Co-op,"A stealth based cooperative game that has 2 players fulfilling different roles, specifically one player being a type of infiltrator and another player being a long-range sniper to provide cover, take down difficult to reach enemies, and provide intel.\n\nThe infiltrator will have a decent variety of stealth tools at their disposal; methods of distraction, tools for hacking, equipment for infiltration. (think something like a simpler form of splintercell or even metal gear)\n\nThe sniper on the other hand would have a differing arsenal of long-range weaponry access to extra pieces of intel [ie. uav sweeps, thermal vision scopes and a different perspective of a base] and a semi-limited free form to positioning and tactics. (so as to provide new angles, opportunities and to prevent any amount of monotony from just staying in one place).\n\nWhat my major focus for this type of game would be, Game-play and ensuring that both players feel like they can contribute something to each mission.\n\nI wanted to keep this simple as to allow some form of creative freedom should anyone try to pick this idea up. I feel like it could be a decent step into filling a bit of a void where 2-player only Co-op games once existed as my friend and I noticed a good lack of them in recent years. Likely platforms would be PC and likely the modern consoles as well."
5mogt3,A puzzle game where you have a tool that can switch game genres,"It's exactly what it sounds like. You can switch between game genres at will to solve puzzles. Some genres won't really work (I'm pretty sure you can't incorporate rhythm into solving puzzles), but some genres I think can work.\n\nLike, for example, maybe in a cutscene your character says that he can see a symbol that might help in a puzzle, but you can't see it yourself, so you change the genre to a first person game so you can see what your character's talking about.\n\nOr maybe there's an enemy that you try to fight, but he's too fast for you to defend yourself, so you switch to a turn-based RPG, so that he can only attack on his turn.\n\nThose are just my ideas. You probably can think of more. I only just thought of this yesterday."

5mn1qm,New game idea,"For a mobil game...\n\nI have 0 experience with game design and I hate to be the ""idea guy"" but the best ideas sometimes come from nowhere.\n\nThere truly are some awesome games on the google play/app store but TBH, how many? 100 maybe?\n\nA lot of games- such as Clash of Clans, Dawn of Titans, Clash Royale, Castle Clash (to name a few) are all basically the same idea- like build for yourself, attack others and join a clan/alliance/whatever.\n\nBut what if someone were to come out with a new type of game? My idea is simple and I don't want any credit or money, I just want a new ligit kind of game. Something new, that no one's heard of.\n\nWhat if, instead of the focus being around the player, it was placed around a ""clan""? Instead of focusing on your own village (or whatever), it could focuse around building a huge empire- one where everyone from the clan contributed to.\n\nIn this game, the clan would be everything. You could control every aspect of the clan, including paying extra to allow more space for more players. You could even have it to where the main clan could create several other clans all under one leader to form a village.\n\nNow for Clan vs Clan: Clans would go up against each other and each player would accumulate CP (clan points) based on destruction percentage. (This system would be similar to Boom Beach's task force.)\n\nThanks for taking the time to read this, and as I said before I don't care about the money or credit. I just care about giving suggestions and helping out in that area."
5mmwve,"""Chiraq""","An open world game that would take place in modern day Chicago. You are a 19 year old from West Englewood, that has grown accustom to the impoverished lifestyle. You start by being a relatively low-scale drug dealer in your mom's minivan. You make  couple drops to friend's houses to essentially get a feel for how you interact in the open world. However certain roads are not safe to travel but may be a faster option which may come into play throughout different missions. After each drop ""opportunities"" open up which ultimately decide your fate within the game for example your homie Dre asks you to help him stick up a trap house to receive stolen drugs. A few days after the stick up you get a call that your older brother has been shot and killed in a set up drug deal. You are now left as a man seeking vengeance of his brother and are in pursuit to be one of the most infamous drug kingpins Chicago has ever seen, El Chapo ain't got shit on you. As that is a look into the just the story aspect. There are lots of interactions that could occur for example if you don't answer your phone for multiple drug deals then they will not continue to hit you up ultimately losing cash flow. You can go to your homies house to play dice and sip lean. You could take out trap houses to gain territory. You could farm. . . weed obviously. Your phone is all you have to get through objectives via texts, map locations, etc. "
5mkix5,Mobile Game Project,"Hi There,\n\nSo I was thinking about this game I want to make, but as I'm completely new to programming, I would like some response to my idea before I devote a large amount of time to it.\n\nThe game is fictional and slightly Fantasy based. It is somewhat inspired by Clash of Clans and The last of us. The game follows a group of maffia members who've hid themselves away. Through money laundering and completing operations you coordinate yourself, you get money and influence. With these materials you try to survive, outsmart the cops who are on your heels and strive to be able to live in the light again.\n\nI have a lot more in mind, but want to keep it somewhat limited and dig into possile future features at another time. I think my current idea might be somewhat ambitious as it is already. What do you think of the idea? Do you have any suggestions or critiques? please let me know.\n\nCheers "

5oef3t,[A rough sidequest idea for an RPG] The Fertility Trap,"The character ends up on an island. Not on a deserted one, frankly quite the opposite. An unspecified while ago a supernatural disaster of some sorts wiped out the entirety of the island’s male population, leaving the women to adopt an amazonlike way of living, but also to die out slowly. Sounds like your typical amazon fantasy, where a hero comes in and basically becomes the village’s breeding stallion, right? \n\nWell, as the tropes say, All Men Are Perverts, and by extension all gamers obviously are. As the branches of the isle’s quest unveil, the player is allowed to heroically contribute to ‘solving the village’s dwindling population problem’. Still sounds like a typical amazon fantasy for you? \n\nHere’s the catch – when the final arc of the sidequest nears its end, the character has to fight the level’s boss - the isle’s goddess of fertility, who gets progressively stronger buffs depending on the amount of time the player decided to spend detracting from the main plot, up to an almost absolute annihilation had he prioritized reproducing over the actual goals. \n\nWhat do you guys think - a different idea for a scaling boss, maybe a deconstruction of the popular view on the topic of sex in games, maybe something else? \n"
5ocsb7,Distribution and warehousing Sim,"I love optimization and micromanagement games. Lately I have been obsessed with factorio.\n\nI was recently working at a distribution center that deals with online shopping and I had an idea. I was absolutely mesmerised by the Fork trucks zipping around, orders being picked, those orders being sent to an embroidery station to be customized for the customer, conveyors taking picked items to be packed in boxes, and more conveyors taking those packed boxes to be shipped out in trucks. I have also spent time at a grocery Distribution Center that shipped out bulk pallets to stores in the area. The entire inventory in these places was never there for more than a week and they also had giant freezers to keep goods frozen.\n\nI think a game that dealt with laying out and building the systems in the youth centers along with inventory and manpower management would be incredible. Depending on your inventory, you would have to adjust your approach to the game considerably.\n\nFresh food and groceries/large retail: fast turnaround, dedicated shipping requiring Fleet Management, special areas to deal with refrigerated and frozen foods, sending out pallets full of items.\n\nOnline shopping: bringing in inventory in bulk and picking individual items to be packed together and sent in small orders via commercial shipping companies ( FedEx UPS USPS), possible slow turnaround.\n\nWholesale distribution: bringing in and selling building materials and parts. Limited shipping out of inventory, customer site delivery. Customers come to you to buy equipment and parts. Deals with specific items such as car parts, HVAC, Plumbing, electrical, and so on. Very limited with automation abilities. May have a showroom for customers, and classrooms for industry-specific training.( I know this one sounds difficult)\n\n\nSorry for any spelling and grammar mistakes. I'm on mobile."

5o2pqi,More Cute Jelly Blobs!,"**Summary**\n\nYou get to control a colony of microscopic jelly blobs! What could be more fun? :)\n\n...\n\n**People &amp; Behavior**\n\n* The jelly blob people are tiny creatures that live in your back yard! They are made of a jellylike substance. There are several communities of jelly blob people which are made up of different flavors. Adults are made of two blobs, while children are made of only one.\n\n* Adults sorta bounce to get around. Children will roll if bumped, but they usually just sit around and wobble. If blobs are kept in the sun too long, they will die and their body will turn into solid jelly blocks, which can be crafted into useful items. If blobs spend too much time in the rain, they will melt into a puddle of jelly. If they get too cold, they will freeze, but don't worry, when it warms back up they will be good as new. If it gets too hot outside, they must hide underground or they will turn into sticky impassible tar puddles, even in the shade!\n\n* To heal, they need nectar, which is usually found in flowers. If one eats too much nectar, one of its blobs will start to swell up, and eventually split in two, producing a baby jelly blob. After some time, the baby will grow into an adult without needing any food. Since the jelly blob people are super tiny, flowers are huge to them, so they have to work together. If a blob doesn't eat too much nectar, it will be safely stored inside of its body, ready to heal wounds, and for other purposes... Also, blob puddles can be used as nectar before they evaporate.\n\n...\n\n**Special Blobs**\n\n* You wouldn't think that tiny blobs of jelly would last long in your back yard, but luckily, these are no ordinary blobs of jelly! Although they are extremely accident prone, and there are tons of dangers in your backyard, they have developed several interesting adaptations. For instance, \n\n* if you bump/push a baby blob too much, it will get upset, and become acidic, turning any nectar it consumes into dangerous acid!\n* If you let a baby blob freeze and thaw out twice, it will develop a hardened skin and can be used as a block, but will be very slow moving.\n* If you let a baby blob stay hot, but not too hot, and push it around, it will develop sharp spikes!\n* If you force feed a baby blob a lot of nectar, it will get extra big and round, and becomes a nectar storage blob when it grows up (with only one segment so it can't move by itself).\n* If you dunk a baby blob into the jelly of a different flavor, it will develop into a spy blob!\n* If you keep a baby blob extra damp, but not too damp, it may develop into a swimming blob that other blobs can walk on, but it will also be extra sensitive to the sun's rays when on land.\n\n...\n\n**The Environment**\n\n* In surface mode, the game looks a bit isometric, with a dirt floor and a bunch of huge stems and rocks, but it's otherwise mostly flat. Areas with plants will be more shady, with things like ferns casting huge fern leaf shaped shadows, etc.\n\n* Tower mode is basically side-view. You enter tower mode when you try to harvest nectar by starting/selecting a tower. Blobs can climb up the stems of flowers by sticking to the side and forming a tower, increasing height by squeezing underneath rather than the usual ladder method. Be careful where you make your tower, as the hot sun can dry out your blobs!\n\n* Underground mode is like a dungeon level. It is only one level tall for the sake of simplicity, but there's no detail on how far under ground it is... You'll have to use jelly blocks in order to keep the underground structure from caving in. Be careful though, as winter temperatures can freeze the ground, and you'll have to wait for your blobs to thaw out.\n\n...\n\n**Crafting and Construction**\n\n* They may look like little pebbles, but jelly blocks are the dead bodies of fallen jelly blobs! They aren't even completely solid! Because of this, your blob people can flatten blocks into panels after a while of bouncing up and down on them. Since they're dehydrated jelly, they're light and can be stacked on top of each other. Blob people *can't* lift blocks above their heads, but they can hold onto a block while being raised along a stem.\n\n* Your blob people can build simple shelters on the surface by stacking two blocks, and balancing a panel on top of them. Of course, they will probably fall apart in the wind (real game mechanic). Once you have access to nectar, you can use some of it as mortar, creating a super-glue bond between blocks and panels to make bigger structures. Other than making towers to collect nectar, walls are limited to two blocks tall, which is just tall enough for an adult blob. Don't forget to bond it with the ground, or you could lose your whole house in a storm!\n\n...\n\nto be continued..."

5nz7cu,Don't get caught / survival mix game idea.,"I recently kept having this dream about what was seemed like a mix of payday two in the stealth mode, (don't get caught part) and some sort of survival game. (survival part, I'll go more in-depth later) Anyway, I thought I might as well try and submit it to this Reddit to see if it would be a feasible game to develop.\n\n**Stealth part;** You originally start out in the forest (could be changed) near a neighborhood, in the neighborhood there would be dogs and regular humans and possible other things that could alert of your presence. Of course this could be changed to have more things. If you go close enough to the dogs,(Maybe without even being seen due to their ability to smell?) or make too much noise they could be alerted, (and maybe chase you down after being alerted) Then the humans would be alerted to you by looking  straight at you, or if you are making too much noise within an area noise shouldn't be made (like their house) however, unlike Payday where the people just immediately forget about it after a certain amount of time, they would 'remember' that sight or sound, and then perhaps a second time after they would start looking around the house. (Subject to change)\n\n**Survival part;** This part of the dream I had was a bit hazier, but I think I can fill in most of it. Basically there isn't an 'inventory' for you but there is like 5 (?) 'slots' that would be in the bottom left of your screen that could hold items. (Very subject to change, unless that would be most appealing?) Anyway, those items could contribute to a hunger, thirst, or health bar. And to ensure that the 'Don't get caught' part always remains in the game instead of just a side feature, the only way to 'heal' yourself would be to find items in the humans buildings, which wouldn't be infinitely supplied either. Food and drinks you could also acquire from their houses and other places early game to help, and then later on you could hunt animals, or find water from rivers and streams (which could also damage you making more of a reason to go to humans for food and such) There would be a crafting feature, but I'm not quite sure how I could fit it in appropriately as it could be done in numerous ways, but I was thinking of just having it be sort of like Minecraft, but without the crafting table, and only that 2x2 area grid. Which could allow for simple recipes, like maybe a bow that could be made out of 'rope' and two pieces of wood. (As stated before all crafting things would be very subject to change, to fit what the game style would become) I imagine that later on you could acquire an axe from the humans to chop down trees, which you could use to build stuff like a log cabin or something, (still very subject to change)\n\n**The goal;** I guess you are like some primate version of a human, or some other animal that has developed a high enough intelligence to know how to build / survive like a regular human, so you are not appreciated by humanity, because they believe some monster is trying to attack them and thus they try and attack you.    Your goal is to eventually become self sufficient in the map for a certain amount of time. (Subject to change) where for each time that you accomplish this, you can earn a type of Coin (Could be changed to something else.) to which could be spent to unlock new maps, which offer new experiences. (I personally like this idea because it gives a reason to keep playing the game, however it could be subject to change as well.)\n\nSorry for making this long, but I wanted to try and make my literal dream game a bit more clear for both myself and for the others, to try and differentiate it from other games that do exist, and not make it an exact mix of two or more games and nothing else. I would also really appreciate feedback as this is the first major game dream that I have had and can remember clearly after waking up."

The players need to be wary and communicate with eachother to figure out which hero is in their base and work together to kill him before the Boss gets killed. \n\n**Standout Features:**\n\n\n* Depending on developer experience the map could be made out of randomly connected modular map tilesets  making it hard to navigate. \n\n\n* As a Henchman you only have two magazines and one gun so you need to loot the bodies of your fallen comrade to arm yourself better but at the expense of getting closer to the hero who killed them.\n\n\n* The map has special stations and rooms which you have 2 minutes to familiarize yourself with locations containing med-packs, extra guns behind a safe that only opens once the alarm is set off, alarm stations as well as sentry posts, armor and robots, key codes for the gorillas, deploy-able turrets. \n\n\n**Possible Platforms:**\n\n\n* PC\n\n\n**Art Style** \n\n\n* Stupid uniforms for each map. \n\n\n[Like these](http://www.imfdb.org/images/thumb/8/84/APIMOM-92FS-1.jpg/600px-APIMOM-92FS-1.jpg)\n\n\n[or these](http://images.propstore.com/150218.jpg)\n\n\nGraphics would lend itself to a cartoon style very much like the obvious [Team Fortress 2](http://media.steampowered.com/apps/tf2/blog/images/blog_chars_heavy2.jpg) or [Overwatch](http://upload2.inven.co.kr/upload/2015/11/13/bbs/m12571553157.jpg) but for those who remember [No One Lives Forever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ny2scpc_N5w) would have a very good idea of the style I think would work best. \n\n"

Put a camera 2 meters behind a real car (build a piece of metel 2 meters from the tow bar then raise it two meters high) drive it around using gaming steering wheel. Then convert your findings into the game to make a realistic car game. Cant belive it has took this long.

5ntm3m,Minecraft Creative Mode on Steroids,"The idea I have came about while trying to put together a mod pack in Minecraft that would allow the most options for creativity. No survival mode intended, purely building. I found that the mods often weren't compatible, complete, or versatile enough to cooperate with other mods (such as Carpenter's Blocks shapes and certain Chisel blocks). \n\nMy idea is to make a game similar to Minecraft that allows the most freedom of creativity in the most user-friendly way. I had the idea of some sort of ""block creator"" GUI, where you could choose a shape, a texture, and a color. Instead of scrolling through hundreds of individual blocks, you can just pick what you want and build with it. The other primary idea is a universal tool that allows for things like copy/pasting, rotating, wall-building, selecting and other functions that make the building process easier.\n\nWould anyone be interested in this type of game? I've been working on the idea for a while now, I just don't know how or if to do anything with it."

5noqpa,Mobile Naval Real Time Strategy Game,"The idea I propose is for a strategy naval combat game. A realistic but not complex simulation of the kinds of decisions admirals make. A simpler version of ""Harpoon"" for mobiles. Consider these points:\n- vast majority (or all) of gameplay takes place on the map. The player's role is to issue simple commands to warships (either individual or task forces)\n- These commands would include go to a point on the map, engage target, power on/off to sensor (eg radar), power on/off to weapon system.\n- Vessels would be a simplified representations of real life platforms, eg. Castle class destroyer\n- Each vessel type would have certain characteristics such as max speed, cruise speed, armour/hit points, sensors, weapons, etc.\n- Sensor and weapons would have certain characteristics too: range, arc, accuracy etc. which would show up on the map around the vessel when selected\n- When designing ships you can copy and paste the same sensors or weapons when different warships use the same systems\n- Most of the fun in the scripted missions would be the finding, approaching, stalking, attacking your targets with selected weapons. You can have very varied missions and real or made up scenarios. Escort missions, scouting for bigger vessels, guarding a border, hunting pirates - these just some ideas for scenarios \n- The two most challenging things for the developer would be a good AI and a well designed interface\n- Other than that the game should be easy to make\n- I think the map should be of the whole world with pretty accurate coastlines. It should also have a couple of optional overlays (one political map with country boundaries and one with latitude and longitude lines)\n- There is a lot to be said about including photos of the ship types included and maybe a short description with specs to increase immersion. (Accessible from the ""encyclopaedia"" tab)\n- A good soundscape would go a long way too (good fade ins and fade outs, realistic noises of engines, guns etc) I don't care much for music but I suppose it would be wise to have it too\n- I think it would be best to make the game with a somewhat limited scope at first with scenarios from world war 2. Then, when the development budget allows, more units can be added in game updates. I think the developer should make the game with the possibility of adding a broader range of weapons (eg adding modern missiles), sensors and platforms (maybe subsurface or air platforms) in later updates.\n- The price point should be high (I'm thinking $6 to $10) as it is not a product for the masses\n- If the project is managed sensibly the cost of production should be fairly low as there is little need for fancy graphics or animations. All of the action is on the map.\n- Please research the ""Harpoon"" series for PC for more ideas\n- Also, I have more ideas about specifics of this game so if you'd like to hear them please let me know.\n"
5nol4g,War RogueLike Idea,"So you have your character that spawns in on the front lines of a battlefield where two massive AI teams are fighting each other. You shoot at a couple bad guys, get some XP, then some sniper guns you down. After death there opens a shop screen, where you can buy new load outs and upgrade skills (aiming, running, etc.). Then you spawn back in, random position on the front lines, and you get more kills and you push further into enemy territory, then a tank kills you. Rinse and repeat, trying new tactics like flanking, or rushing, or being with a squad and slipping past the front lines. Eventually you reach the enemy base, where you try to infiltrate and kill all the enemies inside, and blow it up. Then you win, and maybe you can try again with a procedural map, and a different landscape."
5nojse,Pirate MMORPG,"Here's a game idea that I've been thinking about for a while. I'd call the game Pirates of Different Realms. It's an online MMORPG that has the combat and the exploration of The 3D Zelda games (specifically Wind Waker).\n\nWhen you start the game you customize your character an then choose what realm you are from. There are 4 realms--each taking one corner of the map. There is the forest realm, which is inside a vast forest, the fire realm which is inside a volcano, the water realm which is in an underwater city, and the dark realm which is underground. Each realm has its own perks (I haven't decided what they are). Once you do that you can begin you spawn in your realm, where you can do quests. this is the time where you can get used to the controls, combat strategies, and overall just get used to the game.\n\nLike in any MMORPG, you kill things to get xp to level up your character--and this game is no different. After you have reached level 8, you can exit your realm. Once you do that, an npc greets you and gives you a free boat and a sail that always makes the winds at your back. Then you can sail the seas. To upgrade your boat you need to explore different islands. many islands have a cave(which is like a dungeon in LoZ). In the caves you fight enemies and solve puzzles and at the end of the cave, you fight a boss and get a unique item like a new sword, a hat, a bow, a shield, or even a harpoon. Caves are also a good way to get xp and Gems(which is the currency). You can use Gems to buy upgrades from the npc that gave you your ship. Upgrades include the speed of your boat, the range of your cannons, etc.\n\nThe part of this game that I think would be the most fun is fighting other players from different realms. If you encounter a player from a different realm, you need to kill them. If you encounter another player from a different realm on land, the combat, like I said before, is like Zelda: z-target onto your opponent and dodge their attacks. Once you find an open point, attack. Its easier to understand if you know the combat mechanics from 3d Zeldas. If you encounter an enemy pirate on the seas, you can either fire cannons at their boat (or ship depending on size) or you can use a rope to go onto the enemy pirates' boat. You can them kill them. If you kill an enemy pirate, you get 10% of their gems if they are level 15 or higher. This is so players levels 8-14 can have a fair and fun experience and not lose all of their gems because they don't have enough experience with fighting other players.\n\nIf you somehow enter another realm, you have a chance to kill the king (which is an npc because players can't be online at all times). Players from that realm will get an alerted that somebody has invaded their realm. they can teleport back to their realm (after waiting 30 seconds) and try to kill the enemy pirate. If the pirate enters the castle of the king, players can play as guard and try to kill the invader. If you somehow manage to get past or kill all the guards and kill the king without dying, you get a badge and a shit ton of gems. The badge is useful because it intimidates other players--making them say ""oh crap, maybe we should run, this guy has a badge!""\n\nThere would be many islands to explore so the game would last very long and can maybe make you stay up all night. Playing this game with friends, fighting pirates, getting rich. I think this game would be a wonderful experience. What do you think?"

5nl3fe,Tycoon/Simulator Ideas?,"Looking for a simple tycoon based game to make. I would like the game to be partly skill based, instead of pure luck. Thank in advance :)"
5nkvkq,ALTME.Hero,"Hello, this is the second post for this game idea. I'll be deleting the first one though for several reasons.\n\nThe following idea is feasable on any platform. \n\nBasically it's about an Isometric Multiplayer RPG, where teams play  gainst eachother with customizable characters. (Inspiration taken of several games)\n\nThe main aspect of the game lies in its character customzation.\nThe point is that your character will look however you want (within the given possibilities) without affecting the characters stats.\n\nI'll write more about the cusomization later and focus on how the gameplay is supposed to work for now.\n\nPlayers are only able to select a given action once it is their turn to play. \nAn action can be executed whenever the action gauge is filled, meaning that there's no specific order in player turns. Depending on actions the action gauge will fill up faster or slower for the following action.\nGoal will be to complete the respective game modes objective.\n\nThe actions of which a player can chose are :\n6 normal attacks: Attacks that will affect ""Spirit""\n3 HP attacks: Attacks that will affect ""Existence""\nMovement: Change character location (Gauge refills 25% faster)\nGuard: (Don't know if reduce or negate damage) Enter guarding stance until the gauge is refilled. Certain attacks can break guard, freezing the action gauge for a short moment.\nDodge: Dodge an incoming attack upon selection. If the dodge is successful the Action gauge refills instantly. Upon failing to dodge an attack the gauge refills normally.\nTransform: Release the characters full power and gain bonus stats.\nNegation: Instantly cancels the attack that is currently hitting the player, and negates all current negative status effects. (2 charges that fill up with the time.)\n\nA character has several stats, which can be increased by using the stat points gained through level ups and the use of non visual items, that can also hold certain effects.\nExistence: This games HP\nSpirit: Is a value, that represents the damage you will inflict to the target the next time you hit with an Existence attack.\nStrength: represents the characters value concerning the scaling of normal (Spirit) attacks. Normal attacks affect the targets Spirit value and add the opponent's removed value to your own.\nDefense: Works to counter the strength value. \nSpeed: Represents the speed with which a character changes his position while moving and the speed at which the action gauge refills.\nCritical: Increases critical hit chance aswell as critical hit multipliers. The critical value only affects Spirit attacks. (Except for ""Fading Status"" : Will explain later)\n\nIn most games, characters have set roles. In this game roles are made by the selection of your stats and abilities.\n\nBy finishing games, players can earn experience, in-game currency (for new clothes) and train their skills (attacks).\n\nAttacks have to be used to level them up and make them stronger as well as to unlock newer attacks.\nSkills are divided in melee and magical attacks of different types with different effects.\n\nSo, this is mainly what the idea is about. Of course this is just a part of the whole thing and I still have more information that completes probably all questions that are left in a word document I made a while ago.\nIf anyone's interested, just PM me with your mail and I'll send it.\nIf people wanna discuss this idea here, I wouldn't mind that either."
5ngkwx,Caterpillar survival journey,"The game is about a caterpillar trying to (slowly) get to the top of the plant, while avoiding being eaten on the way.\n\nYou start in the dirt, because your egg got loose by the wind or something, so you have to climb up the plant that is next to you, in a journey to the very top, where the leafs are tender enough that you can eat them, so you can finally become a butterfly\n\nthe mechanics should be really simple, you can only move up and around the stem. hide from enemies (birds, grasshoppers, mantis...) behind some conveniently placed leaves and use camouflage. basically remain still on places where your texture matches the plant (maybe some parts of the leaves) so the giant and terrifying bird, doesn't recognise you.\n\nthe level design consist in a very near view of the plant you are climbing, all the rest of the world is really out of focus, even the plants next to you.\n\nSome other things that could be implemented later in game is the effect of wind on the plant, or considering how the weight of the animals bend the branches. maybe some silk hanging and balance, to reach the plant next to you when you sudenly discover that a huge out of focus human or animal cut the plant you are in. \n\nThe idea is trying to convey how simple, everyday things (for us) can be the most challenging thing the the world for a bug, like crossing a trail of ants.\n\ni have some other ideas around it, but that's the basic."
5nfv7z,Easy Game Idea,"Hi, I need an easy game idea that I could make in around 10 days. Thank you."
5nfs06,Ladder Commander,"I have a quick idea for a mobile device game where you command a group of unique heroes by drawing ladders with your finger from room to room.\n\nYou start at the bottom of a tower, the tower is made up or rooms of varying sizes *(1x1, 2x1, 2x2)*. Some rooms have different properties: \n\n* Dark - you can't see what's in it\n* Sticky Floor - some heroes might be permanently stuck to it\n* Cursed - You take extra damage\n* Crumbling Floor - the floor has a x% change of collapsing, taking your entire team to the room below.\n\nEach room has some elements in it:\n\n* Monsters\n* Traps (Spikes on floor or ceiling)\n* Doors to other rooms\n* Caged heroes which can be rescued, and added to your team\n* Supply (e.g. Archers only have 3 arrows, they need to resupply)\n* Powerups (heals, shields, attack boost, invisibility)\n\nWhat could make this game interesting is the decisions you have to make based on the heroes you have in the team, and the rooms that you can potentially climb to. For example if you have a guy with the torch you might be more open to the possibility of going into into dark rooms.\n\nSome heroes could be:\n\n* Armored Knight - melee, and can take many hits before falling\n* Archer - shoots ranged arrows\n* Key Master - opens doors\n* Torch Kid - lights flammables, reveals darkness\n* Healer - heals everyone every-time you move to a different room\n\nI feel to properly prototype this game you need to create a lot of content that would allow for the interesting decisions. Otherwise it will feel flat, where all you do is draw ladders and look at your dudes climbing up, and fighting monsters.\n\nSo, what do you think of the general idea?"

5ndkun,Tile World: A procedurally-generated survival game in a world that's a large grid of rooms.,"Inspired by [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/hypotheticalsituation/comments/5mx0fz/everyone_in_the_world_is_put_into_unique_rooms/?utm_content=comments&amp;utm_medium=hot&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=hypotheticalsituation) thread.\n\nYou'd have a huge, procedurally-generated grid of various rooms. There would be a list of different room types that it would choose from, and the exact placement of the furniture would be random.\nYou'd have to mind your food, water and energy throughout the game, using supplies you find in the rooms.\n\nFood and water deplete overtime, and can be found in the right rooms.\n\nEnergy is replenished by sleeping, but you have to wait around while your character sleeps rather than skipping throught it. A bed or couch makes sleeping go faster.\n\nYou can open a door to an adjacent room by pressing a certain button when facing the wall you want to open to. However, if another player has been to that room before you, you must wait for them to accept the door. You can only open doors from rooms that you got to before any other player. Remember that they may attack you and take your resources when you open a door to them, or they may help you, so its a gamble. If a player stops playing, it may create inaccessible rooms, or maybe their claim to it could expire. Creating a door also consumes a bunch of energy.\n\nYou also have no way of knowing what type a given room is before you open a door to it.\n\n The room types would include:\n\n- Kitchens, including a fridge with a limited amount of food, tile floors, drawers with items in it that may or may not be useful (like knives, pens, etc.), a water sink/tap, a stove for cooking, and/or an island counter. Not all of them have to be in every kitchen, of course.\n\n- Bedroom, with a bed, a bedside table with information about the game stored in it alongside generally useless, but rarely useful items, and a desk with a computer on it (which allows you to play minigames or something, I guess, but has a limited battery life). Sometimes they may have a walking cane that can be used for a weapon, or a toy chest that you can store stuff in.\n\n- Greenhouses, which have plants that grow food. May include tomatoes, lettuce, potatoes, and a beehive for honey (but those have bees that can sting you, reducing health).\n\n- Bathrooms, with toilets, sinks and bathtubs (useful for getting water).\n\n- Swimming Pools, with just a big basin of water and some lifesaving equipment.\n\n- Barracks, a room with weapons hung on the walls. Could be swords, could be guns, you never know. Perhaps, rarely, armor.\n\n- Kennel, a room with animals in cages. Could be livestock, could be dogs and cats, could be leopards and alligators because why the hell not. Some of the cages may be open, too, so be careful! Maybe dogs could be trained to help you.\n\n- Nothing, just an empty room. You may be fucked if you start here.\n\n- Pit, a bottomless pit. Its impossible to start here, but you can still open a door to here. Walking into it causes falling to death.\n\n- Balcony, generates only next to pits, gives you a nice view into it as well as other balconies bordering the same pit, and has potted plants that may be fruit-bearing.\n\n- Living Room. Couches, TV on a stand that plays little animations when you interact with it, maybe plants. Things may be hidden in couch cushion.\n\n- Cellar, has rare a chance of generating below another room with a ladder leading up. Has barrels in it that contain lots of food.\n\n- Tower, rarely generates above another room with a ladder to climb up to it, giving you a view of other nearby rooms, so you don't have to guess at them."
5nar69,"Third Person ""Sniper-Only"" Online Multiplayer","basically just put some players in a big enough map (maybe like Battlefield multiplayer map?) but only give them a sniper rifle, a knife, and some non-lethal traps (only as obstacle, to slow other players, or negative effect inducing like give shorter breath or shaky hands).\n\nThere are 3 ways to kill: sniper shot, stealth knife kill, or force a player to go to toxic area with traps.\n\nToxic gas will approach the center of the map from the most outside area of the map to quicken the gameplay pace, forcing player to go closer over time, not just playing faraway hide-and-seek, worst case scenario probably a knife fight, so I propose 1v1 knife duel system, you have quick stab, slash, guard, etc.\n\nEXP system, similar to Dark Souls' soul system. Use EXP as money to buy/upgrade skills like\n\n1. Longer Breath: for longer sprint and hold breath longer for more accurate shot\n\n2. Stronger Wrist: lessen the sniper's recoil.\n\n3. Stronger Body: bring heavier rifle, more ammunition, or more traps.\n\n4. Trajectory Approximation: there will be wind factor, so at first you only know the wind direction &amp; strength, but with this skill, there's a reticle that will help you aim accordingly. The reticle gets smaller/more accurate each time you upgrade it.\n\n5. Calming Technique: each time you get shot, your heart rate increase, resulting in less accurate aim / more shaky aim. With this skill, you can sit still and calm yourself to reduce heart rate.\n\nMoney system, to buy better rifle, upgrade the current one, purchase weapon mods (like silencer), special ammo (like heavy bullets that aren't affected by wind), and other stuffs like traps or cosmetics.\n\nEDIT: Radar system to know other players position, but it only reacts to noise or tracker. When a player shot his/her sniper rifle, his position will be 'pinged' on radar for 2-3 seconds. A tracker can be planted by a trap, constantly telling you the tracked player's position, but only the ""planter"" has this information. Tracker will expire after 2-3 minutes. Player may improve radar range, tracker duration, and sound persistence duration with money.\n\nIf there's already a game similar to this, let me know. Otherwise, any inputs are appreciated.\n\nAnd, I'm sorry for my english.\n"
5na9z4,[Help develop my idea] Regarding twitch-based combat,"Hey, I'm developing a 2D action game on my own on my free time and I'm doing fine regarding the graphics, sounds, soundtrack, setting, etc.\n\nEven though it's a twitch-based action game, I'm drawing my inspirations from Junji Ito's and HP Lovecraft's works, respectively.\n\nSo, it's going to be a dark, psychological horror game once the story develops around the reaction-based mechanics, but I seem to be stuck on a small thing: the Combat Mechanics.\n\nAs I said before, I already developed the story, pace, setting, and etc, but the combat itself feels dull for some reason.\n\nI don't feel comfortable to talk about the game in detail, but it's based around imprisoning enemies parts using chains, and then pulling them apart so you can use them as a feature I don't feel like talking about right now.\n\nOn combat, you just need to react to the enemy's attack and hit him while he's stunned in his own move.\n\nThe thing is: the battle itself feels like a pressing of buttons that never develop more than that.\n\n\n\nSo the question is: how can I make so the battle feels ""alive"" without changing the basic concept of ""action-reaction""?

5lufjn,"A sci-fi, space themed space ship battle sim in the vein of World of Warships.",Bonus points if it's Star Wars themed and includes R2-D2-like repair droids.
5lu3dc,A survival game where you'r homeless,"You while be able to choose multiple scenario ( different job, child, city). The cities would be fictional, but each one of them would represent a difficulty level ( temperature, the criminality, the help that gives the government ). You would have many attributes to deal with, such as hunger, temperature, dirtiness... The gameplay would be like punch club but with a survival aspect. I'm actually doing the game on unity so if you have any advice I will be happy to take them."
5ltktm,The Greater Good,"Ever since I read the Republic by Plato, Leviathan by Thomas Hobbes and Brave New World by Aldous Huxley in PHIL 101 last year, I have been fascinated with the idea of how Socrates used a city as a presentation to determine the goodness of an individual, and how that relates to works like Brave New World and 1984.\n\nI have taken this inspiration into the form of a story, which will be transformed into an action/RPG shooter.  Your character, who starts off as a soldier protecting City A, is reunited with her/her best friend after several years of being apart.  The best friend was taken away from society to be inducted into a new class of Guardians (name can change later), who are the group of people who govern the city, and runs into you right before he/she graduates from the Guardian Program.  This reunion sparks a series of events that leads the two of you exiled.  While exiled, the two of you find truths, hidden secrets, and lies that were spun from the Guardians in order to keep the population under control and happy.  As grotesque and horrible as some of this secrets are, you two learn that these atrocities are necessary in order to maintain the peace and functionality of the city.  Regardless, the horrible acts commited by the Guardians causes your best friend to WANT inform the citizens about these truths and instill free form, individual thinking.  At the end you will have to choose rather The Greater Good of mankind (best friend path) or the Good of the City is more important.\n\nSince it is based in a futuristic dystonia (after events of WW3), I thought that I would take a reference from Brave New World called soma, a happy drug that keeps the people happy and carefree, and turn it into a bran chip that releases endorphins (for pain and pleasure) and dopamine (for energy).  This bran chip allows ""magical"" powers to work and it's how you level up. "

5lrmzv,VVVVVV based game in 3D,I had this Idea for a Videogame for awhile now. The main feature would be the same one as VVVVVV (press button to fly 180° above you) but it would be a 3D open world rpg adventure with a big and long story.\nMain Character would be a Girl called Ellie(placeholder name) who's planet got destroyed. She was the only survivor and was flying through the Universe with her Spaceship looking for a Planet she can live on. One day she lands at a Unknown Planet Called: Planet Moake (Placeholder) Where she finds out that the Planet has a a wierd Gravity where part of the World is Upside Down. Badly that Planet is being terrorised by Bad People that are planing on destroying the Whole Planet and creating a new one with the Power of the Star of the Planet. Her Mission is to stop them doing that in battling them.\n\nI know that the Story has many holes but feel free to edit the Idea and take it if you want. If there is a similar Game please inform me
5lonis,EARTHBOUND + JOJO'S BIZARRE ADVENTURES RPG,"Hello reddit,\n\nI came here because I have a game idea and I wanted to see how everybody would respond to it.\n\nI thought about making an RPG game that would closely resemble EARTHBOUND's graphics. The plot would be loosely based on JOJO's BIZARRE ADVENTURES - DIAMOND IS UNBREAKABLE with a similar color pallet and many dramatic scene cuts.\n\nIt would take place in a fictional town in the U.S. where a series of weird murders have been happening. The player controls a boy who is looking for his friends who went missing. As the adventure progresses, he gets involved in a game of cat and mouse where the rules are always changing.\n\nWhat do you think about it? Leave your thoughts below please. \nHave a nice one guys.\nHappy 2017."
5lo1ul,"""The Adjustment Bureau"" - An open-world game that tries to stop you from deviating from its objectives.","I was reading [this article""Always room for improvement: 17 resolutions for pop culture in 2017""](http://www.avclub.com/article/always-room-improvement-17-resolutions-pop-culture-247375) where they say fewer games need to be open-world sandbox games. Other games have made commentaries on their genres (like Undertale for RPGS), so it got me thinking about doing the same for open-world games. What if the game tried to stop you from deviating from the story or not fulfilling fetch quests? What if you tried an alternate love interest or tried going into a building that was empty but the game kept forcing you back onto the rails of the game. \n\nThis reminded me of something similar, a little Matt Damon movie called [*The Adjustment Bureau*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adjustment_Bureau) based off a Philip K. Dick story. Perhaps that would be a good adaptation for a game, with you discovering some glitch in the universe and that you are really in a type of sandbox or test universe for an omniscient being or beings that compel you to finish your tasks and live your life as they scripted it. \n\nNot sure how you could really do this since the game itself, but I welcome any feedback or suggestions.

5ll9u2,Online trading card game with social mechanics,"There are a plethora of trading card games around these days - both physical and software. However, one of the really key aspects of the physical ones that I've not seen done well in the online ones is the social side. The actual act of trading cards, and playing games with your actual friends. \n\nThe software versions all seem to emphasise unique gameplay ideas, new and different ways to play, complex single player scenarios, but not the actual human interaction that is vital to the physical varieties.\n\nI'm curious how well a TCG that made the gameplay simpler - though still interesting - and instead emphasised on the social side of things would work. \n\nI'm thinking that you can have friends you play with regularly - either managed in game or via existing platforms like Facebook - and who you can trade cards with. Can also have match making services for when your friends aren't around, marketplace for larger scale trading, and so on, but putting more emphasis on the social interaction side instead."
5ll1qg,A game with all of the characters you can imagine;Too optimistic or naive?,"Hello everyone,first of all I am not a developer nor artist but I have a great idea about a great game . Before you argue about anything that I am going to say,finish reading until the end,you might find your answer in the text ;) \n\nSo,the game I want to make is a 3rd person fighting game,which would include any character from any TV series,animes,games,movies and comics.Now the copyright problem.Ill explain it further in the text.This game will have plenty of game modes and maps,but to simplify this explanation ill be giving 1 example of each.Lets say the map is NY City,and the game mode is 4 person free for all.The map will be huge(not as huge as GTA,but it would take time to move from one point to another)And the map would also be destructible,shapable according to your willing,for example when batman launches his batwing through a building it will collapse from the point that batwing struck,or any building in that map will be interactable,you would be able to go in any building or shop you can imagine :)\n\nMoving on,about the gameplay &amp; gamemodes;Lets start with the gameplay.Each character will have 16 skills at total but only 4 of them would be able to use in the game,so you could shape your character in the way you like,if you want an agility set spiderman you would put the skill that would help him dodge things,or speed set spiderman you would put the skills that would launch him in high speeds to the designated area.It is not like a skill tree but more like Skill1 will have 4 options Skill2 4,and so far so on.You would start the match with everyskill available(even one you might call as ultimate)and you wont be able to improve them in any way.So it would be a total skill showdown,no items no skill enhancers,its all up to you controlling it.\n\nNow about the gamemodes.Main gamemode would be 4 Person Free for all,as I explained in the upper segment the battles would take place in a map that one may call huge and will consist of players that have all of their 4 skills unlocked.The last man standing would be the winner,but the games would take time(like a really easy game would last at least 30 to 40 min)Due to the fact that one player going all out on another player would max do %30 dmg to that player,and every character will have a regen. skill(which would regen really low like %1 over 30 seconds and you should not be interrupted during that skill)So it would be a long fight.The other game modes might include a team composition like 3v3 or a huge all out game 10v10.But the other gamemode I would like to emphasize is 1v1v1v1vMasterMind.So this will be a gamemode in which the mastermind controlls the maps and ai's such as soldiers or police officers.He/she would send in reinforcements activate traps and even send a huge Boss(think of like a huge form of sandman that entraps players in a skyscrapper).During the first couple of minutes the game would focus on 4 players taking each other out,but during the other couple of minutes the mastermind would join to play and would stay untill the end of the game.MasterMind needs to kill every single player,and for other players to win they must eliminate both mastermind and other players,they might work together to eliminate the mastermind or well,you get the idea :) \n\nNow about the questions you might have; \n\n1)How much will it cost us to buy?\n\nWell,I really dont care about the money,I come from a fairly rich family and all I want is to see this game to be made and to play it.So I plan on making it free,but the world is not that optimistic,so with its kickstarter money %100 of it will be used to recruit 3D modellers,programmers and enviroment artist &amp; etc... After all of these we might need somemore money,I will try to fund as much as possible but if that doesnt cover it up I will have to put some price for the game(dont worry it wont be much again) \n\n2)Which platform will this game be on? \n\nI havent thought that out entirely but I want it to be able to played cross-platformed(like a player in PS4 would be able to play against a player in PC)\n\n                                                          NOW THE BIG ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM,COPYRIGHTS.\n\nWell,I sincerely dont want this game to be a cheap rip-off,but during the development process I would tinker a bit with characters like spiderman will have its spider upside down and etc.. the things that would allow us to avoid and copyright strikes.As I said before,I DONT WANT THIS GAME TO BE A SHITTY RIP-OFF,So if this game hits off during its early alpha and early beta,I would go to every single company that has its characters in this game and would sell every and each share I have on this game to them until I have %0.I would sell the shares according to their character numbers in that game.For example if MARVEL has 30 characters and DC has 5,DC would get the 1/6th of the share that MARVEL gets.But I would entirely get rid of every share that I have.So if they accept it that way,they would implement their own characters and game would be copyright free and better.Lets say this plan hits of I wont get the game out of its beta until every and each of these companies agree to my idea.Other then that the game will stay in beta as long as it needs.\n\nNow I hope I explained it clear enough so that you guys could understand,if you have any questions I am glad to answer them in the comments.Thank you for taking your time to read this ^ Have a nice day :)"
5lk8c5,Modern assassin game,"So pretty simple, you're a hitman, you start out low level maybe for a mob.  You eventually move on to harder hits, better gear etc.  When you get out of the first phase the game becomes open world where you choose your own missions and equipment. You can get bonuses for specific challenges, be stealthy or guns blazing. The less evidence you leave at crime scenes the less you have to fight police/FBI. Eventually you can expand to other cities and take extremely high level jobs from foreign countries and high level diplomats. The end"

You don’t know how or why, but you assume you passed out and someone has taken you back to theirs. \n\nSomewhere in the house is a legless, crazy looking old man with missing teeth and long straggly grey hair. He drags himself around the entire house / up the stairs etc. (He has a wheelchair but he only uses it when he goes outside)\n\nYou don't know where he is, but you start to realise he is a veteran and lost his legs in the war, and that he's absolutely insane.

5lj3hw,A survival horror game with an interesting flair,"The premise is that the protagonist is on community service, and has to go to take care of an older woman. \n\nYou arrive at the house and she's made you a bed, so you go to bed, but you hear bashing and weird noises. She has barred windows because of her mental state and she's sealed the front door. \n\nThe game goes through a day and night cycle, during the day she is seemingly idle (sitting in a room facing the wall or something, but if you attempt to escape she inevitably gets you). During this time, the player can set up cameras anywhere in the house, find tools to help with their escape and plan their exit.\n\nDuring the night, you use the cameras, which you find in a room, to see where the unscripted AI woman is in the house so you can avoid her and escape. She will react to noise or if she sees you. She does a number of unscripted things (standing outside your bedroom door for instance) or running from one room to the next without warning. \n\nThere are many routes out of the house, you just have to find them\n\n"

Basically, all you have is a dot, that is armed with a sword represented by a stick(It's on the right hand so it doesn't look rude), and the sword can only kill enemies at close range, but then there is a Square, that the dot enters and is a vehicle, literally to turn the game into a Twin Stick Shooter with a power fantasy vehicle that can Hover and shoot.

5lfu7f,idea for a new game. (any console),"I have a good idea for a zombie survival game. This is the story of Jackson McRiley, a Country boy that grew up in his small home town. (Made up place) Westernville Arkansas. He woke up one day to go deer hunting. (walks out of his house into the woods) (Shows his stand and the view off of it). A deer starts to walk through. The player shoots the deer. Jackson says "" Another good one for the freezer."" Then he hears rustling in the bushes. Jackson says,""Well i might as well shoot another."" So the player then aims at the bushes. A zombie starts to walk out, paralyzed in fear, Jackson doesn't pull the trigger. Then you hear a snapping noise, The deer stand has fallen off the tree, you then break your gun on impact. Now you must flee through the woods and make it to the house alive, with only a knife and whatever you may find on the way back home. (there's more to the story)"
5ldnn5,An idea I had for a call of duty (part one),"I've been playing CoD for years, and the most recent twists and turns the franchise has taken are not to my liking. In my spare time, I crafted as complex as a game as I could without consulting without actual level designers, programmers or art directors. Please let me know what is good and is not good about the idea so I can use the input to improve my ideas.\n\nIn this first part, I'll explain the setting, basic mechanics, weapons and perks.\n\nThe title is Call of Duty: Shadow Government. The game itself is set in the late 1970s and early 1980s. I drafted up an Activision style press blurb for the game, to better explain it.\n\n*Call of Duty®: Shadow Government is the latest title in the award-winning, heart pounding franchise. Developed by ________, the talented creator of the some of the most played games in Call of Duty® history. Call of Duty: Shadow Government takes the player to the politically charged environment of America in the 1970s and 1980s. No one can be trusted and everyone has an agenda. Three unique game modes: Campaign, Multiplayer, and Zombies, in addition to a revolutionary movement system, are sure to bring the player back to the past in a very welcome change of pace.*\n\nWith that out of the way, I can add little details which help flesh this out.\n\n*Well, GlockInbound, what do you mean by ""revolutionary movement system""? Is this a jetpack game?*\n\nNope. It's new to the franchise in certain ways and very familiar in others. Here's a description;\n\n*The movement system in Shadow Government comes from a desire to change up the old while staying true to it. There’s a reason why the Equipment slot includes both tacticals and lethals; LB on Xbox, L1 on Playstation and Tab on the keyboard are the “Movement Modifier” buttons. Pressing this button while standing or crouching allows you to lean in any direction, even up and down. Pressing this button while sprinting causes you to dolphin dive, and pressing it while prone causes you to roll out of the way. Sidestepping is in the game as well; clicking the movement stick or double tapping the movement key in any direction except forward causes you to step quickly in that direction. This results in a plethora of new movement options, giving the player a chance to outmaneuver pretty much anything. As well as those additions, the player is simply more nimble in their environment; momentum is gained while sprinting, you can vault ledges and slide over cars all the while keeping your gun up. Reloading while sprinting, as well as infinite sprint in multiplayer help this.*\n\ntl;dr the tactical grenade button does cool stuff^\n\n*Here's a list of the weapons as well, please tell me if there are balance issues by the hard numbers provided alone:* https://docs.google.com/document/d/14e0LCW6dlVzHikfy_8BzCvLtece3x2ijNJRUDjuIhsM/edit?usp=sharing\n\n*As well as the perks:* https://docs.google.com/document/d/1onMsVHtiy-kmh5WI-4daL0pAdyG5Niy-9DtE8-Ql70M/edit?usp=sharing\n\nIf there is demand I will continue to provide details, and if not this can fall into obscurity. It's cool either way."
5ldfhb,The Book Of Beasts fantasy,"A game where you start as a normal guy who finds a book in the library. It's called the Book of monstrophy. It contains beasts by pages of common, uncommon, rare, mythical, legendary and Mystery. The young hero/ine embarks to finish the book as the names only are in the book. Along the way you can tame the monsters to use as shoulder attackers, mounts and even fuse with armour/weapon's. \n\nCommon and uncommon are found roaming around their habitat while rare are usually bosses, pack leaders or harder to find. Mythical are found mostly by fusing beasts together or by collecting dragon eggs dropped by powerful mythical beasts (can't be tamed directly). Legendary beasts roam the world and all have a beast exclusive ability like telepotation or freezing / controlling time. Or maybe even necromancy and ally boosting. Mystery beasts are shadows of great power and are found only by battling the strongest beasts for information on them. \n\nWhen full the book will transform into a beast. Knowledgend the Allknowing. It can predict  all moves and dodge magic attacks. It also used a portal like feature to summon weaker versions of beast found in the book. When defeated the player will auto tame him and he will be rideable as a mount whose ability is Monstro rift (portal that summons beasts) he will ride you to a alter were a new book is found 'Mephistos Hell Guide' . This will unlock new realms to find beasts and do side quests\n\nnote: first book - 35 common 20 uncommon 20 mythical 10 legendary 15 mystery. "
5la7fh,Speech Physics Simulator,"My idea is like the Toribash of speaking.  You must control the tongue (perhaps the tongue follows a bezier curve and you must tweak that curve) and teeth and release air from the mouth at the right time in order to say something.\n\nPerhaps it would add some flavor (no pun intended) if you have objectives (words you must try to say).  Plus, some languages include nasal sounds."
5l9ils,Woke up to a thought to a good game I would play on xbox one - Battlefield: Z,"So this is my first time on this Sub but I just woke up to this idea. So if it's not good I'm sorry. Also I'm still waking up so if the idea is bad or if there are things you feel like could be changed or modified for better taste, go ahead.\n\nSo in my dream it was during the evacuation time of a city. You of course being part of the army reponding to orders given to help civilians out of their apartments and complex, fighting off zombies on the way and in the buildings. Now it does and can start slow with finding a few zombies the you must kill with *insert military gun here*, given over time as the infection spreads and the zombies increase in numbers. You will find more zombies and less people to save. Coming to time limits and time for evacuation, you and your team must hold a location. If anyone remembers Gears of War 3 trailer where Dom runs and gives him a gun and they're all in a ditch shooting at lambiant and locust...imagine that but your team and shooting zombies before being engulfed by the unrelenting hordes of the city. Another visual example in my mind is from the show Walking Dead. Season 2 I think where they travel to the disease center to find shelter only to have the lab blow up by oxygen explosion. Well before they go in you see the army line of hummers and machine guns in front of the lab where they held off.\n\nA few modes could be added like protect mode where you have a team and you must hold off the hordes coming towards towards you. This can be expanded however, from the evacuation going wrong and staying and holding up in a building over night in order for a evac to be sent in the morning. The reason being is the excessive amount of other cities and teams and all other choppers are in use. As being stuck in the apartments for a few hours you could maybe be a scout and prevent zombies from getting near the team location this can also maybe be a stealth mode in order not to rile up or attract more zombies to the location. You could also be a scrapper. Resources and rations are low, gotta find food, medicine, ammo. Contents of each apartment are random but always have atleast something of value. The zombies found could be random. To a single zombie and maybe finding all the way to zombie children. Yes you must do the dirty work of killing them. Why children? Because it adds shock value and stands out from most other zombie games. \n\nAs I was waking up more and more, a lot more detail thoughts came to mind but given what it is, I don't expect anyone to really like it. I also have a hard time to express the excitement in my head versus writing it down. I felt like if I didn't post it then a idea that could be great would have been lost and I wanted to share it. Criticism I'm sure you guys will have over my idea but I'm not die hard for details. If any of you decide to make this a thing and get rich off this, atleast buy me a new car. Lol :) \n\nTake care guys and thanks for listening to my crazy ranting idea."
5l6cox,Variations on Planetside,"[b]Be advised. The following post is largely stream of consciousness and may not be legible to nongeniuses.[/b]\n\nIf you aren't familiar with it, Planetside is a MMOFPS where instead of servers or matches, there's 4 massive maps, each around the size of an ARMA map. Each map can hold 2000 players. There's three factions, blue, red and purple, and they engage in a mix of Halo and Battlefield. The game is free 2 play and pay 2 win, and more importantly large organizations of 20-60 members can dominate the battlefield by concentrating and coordinating their forces on certain sectors of the map. At the same time though it is a massively casual affair. In my analysis as a loner player, the system this game uses is even more friendly to solo players than the now ubiquitous solo-queue from games such as LoL and Overwatch, in that you can freely rotate between sectors of the map however you want, and it is much easier to get lost in a 50v50 than a 5v5. \n\nHowever I do have some gripes with Planetside, namely it's Halo meets Battlefield combat style. Basically weapons handle like Battlefield, with bullet drop and loads of customization options, but the players are armored as if it's Halo - so at close range you have to magdump to kill them, and at long range you have to land 8+ body shots with a standard AR to kill. In my opinion this removes the twitch element of FPS and makes the game revolve totally around team coordination. In other words, it's impossible to carry through sheer mechanical ability, as you might be able to in CS or Quake. This may be because PS2 was also released for Playstation 4, and that method of aiming suffers horribly in terms of twitch gameplay when compared to mouse and keyboard.\n\nSo basically I want to keep the format Planetside 2 is packaged in, where you can basically move across a giant map at will and engage in whichever small localized battle suits you for the time being, but refine the gameplay.\n\nThere are innumerable different ways the gameplay could be modified since the FPS is a wide genre. CS is a FPS. Quake is a FPS. World of Tanks is a FPS. Mount &amp; Blade Warband is a FPS. Virtually any of these games could just have their gameplay applied to the PS2 format and you would have an absolutely epic MMO. Imagine a 1:1 scale Middle Eastern city with three factions, Western Forces, Islamist Rebels, and Republican Guard. It could have CS mechanics. It could have CoD mechanics. It could have ARMA mechanics. But the important thing is that it replicates PS2's system of frontlines, buildable respawn points, \n\n[[Retrospective insert for clarity] Some more deets on how Planetside 2 works to make it more clear. Basically there are bases studding the map. Bases have places where you can resupply, spawn vehicles, change your class, and in some cases respawn. A certain type of vehicle is basically a large APC that can be deployed and serves as a mobile respawn point. Since most bases don't have respawns, reinforcement is dependent on someone procuring said MHQ and deploying it somewhere secure that players can respawn at. You can only respawn at one of these places if you died within a short radius of it, however the rare base respawn points you can respawn at or teleport to from wherever. This limitation is mitigated by a mechanic called ""Join Combat"", where there's a button on the map that automatically redeploys you to a combat zone that the game thinks needs more players from your faction. In this way the number of players in a certain sector are limited. \n\nHowever you can only capture a zone if your faction controls a zone adjacent to it, meaning you can't capture facilities behind enemy lines. When a faction garners a certain number of ""Victory Points"" from conquering zones, it wins the map and the map is disabled for a few hours as players get shunted off to a different map.\n\nPlanetside 2 rewards grand strategy that can only be executed by large groups. So for example a clan might attack a base with its main force, but send in lightly armored soldiers with cloaking devices to sow chaos in an adjacent base, forcing the enemy to dedicate a disproportionate amount of its troops to protecting that base, thereby diverting pressure from the main attack on the first base. As a lone player I have seen this tactic done to my faction repeatedly and it is almost irresistible when your side has no countering clan. That said, lone players can still focus on getting frags and unlocking gear, even if the grand strategy isn't something they have access on.]\n\nSoo.. I kind of botched that, but I enjoyed writing, the first two paragraphs in particular, so I didn't want to rewrite it and lose my steam. So I hope that my main feeling about PS2 is now apparent, which is that I greatly enjoy the depths that the matchmaking system has, what with its simultaneous capacity for large organizations and solo play to exist within the same battlespace. However, I do not enjoy the combat very much, because it is extremely punishing to solo players. The most hope you have of being a clutch player is by being a sniper and shooting down waves of enemies as they march across the landscape, or getting in a tank and picking off enemy respawn points to suffocate their reinforcements. Aside from that it all comes down to waves and waves of infantry covering eachother and moving in unison. It looks cool, but it isn't exactly rewarding of raw mechanical ability. In Mount &amp; Blade Warband and Quake you can just kill innumerable amounts of enemies just by being faster than them. That is something I would add. I would have Planetside with castles or Planetside with rocketjumping."
5l23qb,Parkour Labyrinth Game,"The idea I have is like an average maze/labyrinth game.  However, the maze itself is rotated 90 degrees horizontally so that, in addition to navigating through it, you also have to parkour through it.\n\nI would recommend making it first person so that the player cannot see everything (that would pretty much ruin the navigating challenge).  Some basic parkour skills seem like they would be necessary in this game, such as wall jumping, wall sliding, etc."
5l0mtz,Voxel style- WesternCowBoy shooter mobile game,"I'm working on 3d models for this game as we speak and I was wondering would people actually be interested in this type of game, here we go. One thing to mention, if u guys have ideas I might implement them, the game is not 100% thought through. So it's a shooter but in the western theme. As I have mentioned this game would be for IOS and Android. Well anyway it would allow the player to upgrade weapons and and choose some cosmetics, (becuz Im not a big fan a tons of cosmetics that make the game look crazy) and one small thing that makes this shooter different then another shooter is becuz the players can see the bullet fly across the screen, they're not like ur common shooter where they r invisible. Like the bullets still move very fast across the screen. And to wrap it up, players can ride horses and there r melee weapons and there will be TDM and CTF game modes. Also one thing I want to emphasize is that the game will look very good for a voxel game since the lighting will give it a more real feel. This is still a concept and many things could change. I'm only working on the art because I enjoy voxel art. As of rn me and a small team r trying to make games, and this game will probably end up on kickstarter if we can make it."

566n8a,[Request] Looking for a stealth game idea,I want to try my hand at a stealth game and hoped someone might have a storyline or basic idea I could expand on.
566ey4,PVP Bullet Hell,"Hello! So I've had this idea of a bullet hell game (Touhou, etc.) but with PVP. The idea sparked when I saw a boss fight in the game, Sora. If you're skeptical about the plausibility of a PVP bullet hell game, you can see the boss fight here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VqKHDvnYqM\n\nNaturally, being a boss fight, that is a fight against an AI, and the game itself has no PVP. However, that fight looks a lot like how a PVP fight would look in bullet hell form, with a few minor tweaks (especially regarding the ability to dash through bullets in that specific game).\n\nThe concept itself shouldn't be too hard to create given the 2D, simple graphics a bullet hell would use, and the little need for huge world development or story. \n\nOne mechanic I thought would be cool was if people could make their own bullet patterns using pre-made templates. \n\n"
566d2d,My sci-fi Emperor-builder-idea,"Although this might be something someone has already suggested, and design wise it might be quite grand in scope, let me start with how I thought of this mere minutes ago.\n\ntl;dr: Skyrim in space where you are simultaneously the Dovahkiin and the King trying to manage and defend his empire; RPG/4x hybrid sci-fi game.\nHas this been attempted before?\n\nI was looking for something to sate my hunger for **exploration**.\n*Space* being one of the go-to settings for designers to set their game in when designing an exploration oriented game, I saw Masters of Orion and Stellaris in my wishlist on Steam.\nCouple this to the fact that I have been playing a lot of Rebel Galaxy, Black Flag, and some Dragon Age and Dwarf Fortress thrown in the mix, along with a longstanding love for Star Wars and D&amp;D, plus an interest in the X series some people might understand where this idea is coming from.\n\nThe game's start would revolve around the player as an individual, freely created to suit any characteristic and trait the player would like to exhibit in their playstyle. This is import in the sense that it provides perks and limitations, as well as later on being reflected on a much *grander* scale.\n\nWhat I envision is a game that evolves from lone star-wolf (trader, fighter, smuggler, diplomat, explorer, what-have-you) on their own mission, inspiring or terrorising people along the way, to an empire builder that still revolves around that one individual. In a sense the player would gather like-minded people (or force those that are not) around him based on a reputation system, to form a group that would evolve from what one might call a 'gang' or party, to a community, to a civilisation. This would involve RPG as well as management and what I would call 4X systems to work simultaneously.\n\nThe player would always act and be represented as that individual and never as an all seeing *god* or *eye in the sky* as in most RTS games, although I could see some 'management screens' to bridge the gap between play-mechanics."
565rcv,[Request] Sci-Fi/Space game ideas,I am an indie developer who would like some ideas for space/sci-fi games that i could make in my spare time.

564f46,The new game of the century,"Everyone loves the war craft game so I was just thinking that it would be cool if someone made one for ps4 the game is based on protecting your clan or village so it would be cool if you have a selection of species to pick from main being orc or man, you can make a big map for one or malty player offline to get more people and make your clan or village bigger and online or offline vs people with that clan or village you have built like say I have a clan of 50 orcs so I want to vs someone online hit serch and I find some one els with 50 wanting a fight and all the men you lose you can't get back and if you win you get there wounded  and presoners to inprove your ranks it would only be a good game if you are with your men of what ever number vs the enamy with his men on a batelfild  if you kill the chifton in other words the user you get his men that is still alive . I would definitely  recommend this idea as every game play I know would get it you would make a lot of money plus it would be beta than the pc veshon because ps4 is more life like when you are controlling  a character "

562jwf,This is just something i always wanted as a game,"I really... really... REALLY want a game where there are different little villages and towns that will progressively get larger, by expanding the number of houses, extending roads, eventually becoming big enough to be a city, and so on and so forth... but like i want it to only be able to be partially controlled by the players, i want it to be all controlled by an AI, where the AI decides if it is a good idea to make a larger farm or a larger number of houses and what to expand research wise or what religions the town/city is. And there can also be this kind of system where the different towns (once they get big enough) will essentially be able to send diplomats to other civilizations and create these large well developed contracts that create these groups of civilizations that eventually (when they have a large enough number of these groups come together) will become a kingdom, then a nation, country, empire. this game would start off during the time when the Babylon was a powerful nation (city-state... what was it?). please please PLEASE post your own revisions and extra ideas in the comments... i hope this kind of game gets made one day."

55z2ie,Making a video game my company's Christmas party. I need ideas.,"I am a developer and I took on the task of coming up with a themed video game for the upcoming company Christmas party, together with a colleague. \n\nThe company is in the business of offering data about the property market (real estate) to investors, housing associations, or financial institutions. We can help valuate house prices, offer statistics about the market, etc. We also have various software products, where we can plot properties on a map and show you their prices, or we produce various types of reports (property valuations, neighborhood or regional or country-wide statistics, etc.)\n\nThe video game should be something simple enough to make in the following months leading up to Christmas, and it should reflect some of our business themes - maybe something about houses, or map regions, or maybe just a fun game with my colleagues' faces on the characters (although that might be tricky since I don't really have proper photos of all of them). It can be either something single-player or multiplayer, but with a way to keep scores. It will be web-based."
55yszi,Action Sidescroller,"Basically, 2D metroidvania style (either pixel or 2D graphic) with RPG element (EXP, level up, equipments, skills, etc) set on an endless, procedurally generated levels.\n\nSo, your character is an adventurer that come to a town with a big gate that leads to an endless dimension made by a powerful wizard 1000 years ago, meant as a prison for the terrifying demon of destruction.\n\nPleaded by the townsfolk, you decided to help them and enter the gate. To get to the next level you need to find a certain door, when you enter the door, loading screen ensues (I have an idea for the loading screen too: your character or just a shadow figure running to the right side). The door may lead to a completely different area, maybe a castle or under the volcano.\n\nThe demon (last boss) can be found on a certain level, depends on the difficulty: level 30 if it's easy, level 60 if it's normal, level 90 if it's hard, and level 120 if it's extreme.\n\nCharacter may only level up to Lv100? But the higher the area level, the more powerful the equipments become (basically, random loot system).\n\nAfter you defeat the boss, you can continue exploring the dimension (and maybe find secret boss?) or go back to town and watch a rolling credits.\n\nThis is maybe too far fetched, just an idea I have in my mind.\n\nThanks for listening through my rant!\n\nCritics, suggestions, and maybe ""why this game is impossible"" are welcome. \n\nEDIT: just remembered that Castlevania SotN is what I had in mind when I describe this..."
55yi5n,Space Truck Simulator,"(The name would rather be Space Hauler or something. I used the title for clarity.)\n\n""We already have that."" Well, space games only have transport as one of their aspects. A game *focusing* on that could flesh it out considerably.\n\n""So, buy freight, fly straight line, sell? The tension is killing me."" Not quite. While I didn't really consider yet the problem of the large scales of space (partly because truck simulators usually only let you drive through scaled-down versions of the world): There could be various hazards (e.g. asteroids, unexpected bodies of mass (incl. Black Holes), and even science fiction objects like wormholes) you need to avoid, and depending on your drive/fuel/load, deceleration or steering could be an interesting/challenging numbers game requiring various different decisions (e.g. choice of least negative impact, just like normal sim-driving).\n\nAdditionally, contrary to truck simulations where you just sit in the cockpit and see the speed, fuel, damage, time left, a space ""truck"" simulator could allow you to deal with other parts of the ship, e.g. work on or reconfigure the engine, reroute energy, repair holes caused by micrometeorites, maybe toss some of your freight so you can brake/steer in time. Maybe you could even bargain with smaller ships that you meet on the way and give them some of your load or get additional wares.\n\nYou might also have to deal with pirates, which would not be a dogfight experience but flying straight while automated turrets that you hopefully already had the cash to purchase shoot at the attackers, and/or you have to sit in a dome and aim at the ships circling you.\n\netc."
55wnyx,10 Minutes to Conquer the World,"I've finally found a subreddit to dump this idea in! It's been buggering me for a while along with some others, but since I don't even like programming it has been sitting in a corner of my mind. No more!\n\nI envisioned some kind of quick, relatively simple and cartoonish RTS ala AoE with a permanent 10 minute time limit covering from the ancient era to the late medieval period. A randomized map with randomized resources, with a few premade maps for between-friends tournaments and such.\n\nThe main point of the game would be building cities that expand your borders, and then building resource gathering and enhacement buildings within those borders with research taking place in the capital city. All with the goal of invading enemy players and capturing their capital city. For simplicity there would be only three ""physical"" resources; building materials (lumber camp, quarry), food (farms), and war materials (iron mines, copper mines).\n\nCombat would be the ""great"" part of the game. There would be five types of land units and three naval ones; frontline units (spearmen, swordsmen, etc), ranged units (archers, crossbowmen, etc), support units (ballista, trebuchet, etc), generals (give combat bonuses and higher chances of special tactics) and mobile (cavalry). Naval units would be much more simple, with capital ships having higher firepower but lower speed and a hefty cost and screen ships having lower firepower but a great speed and cost. Support ships with medium stats and a higher range would make a fine complement. Where the combat would shine though, is in tactics. Having a frontline unit be charged in the rear would give it a huge penalty to morale and probably rout it, while having a general on one side might activate a ""square formation"" special tactic that reduces the charge's effectiveness and allowing a counter-attack. Some of these tactics could be:\n\n\n/Offensive/\n-Attack (regular attack, no bonuses)\n-Cautious attack (reduces taken health damage)\n-Charge (increases taken health damage, increases morale damage dealt)\n-Relentless assault (increases all damage dealt)\n\n/Defensive/\n-Defense\n-Tortoise formation (reduces ranged damage received)\n-Tight formation (reduces health damage received)\n-Valiant defense (increases all damage dealt, decreases morale damage taken.)\n\nWell, that's all I can write now. Feel free to ask any questions!"
55ufj8,Some type of assassin/spy game where you're killing people who come in a shop,"This game was pretty much from a dream of mine. Like an actual dream, I thought it seemed pretty good.\n\n\n\nGame where you're a robot hitman/assassin spy thing. You sit at a coffee shop/restaurant. You take orders from a newspaper machine. However when you use it it gives you orders. The newspaper machine also has a radio in it that broadcasts news, but like before, when you use it, it has the recording of your Chief/Handler/whatever telling you what to do.\n\n\n\n\nFor example it may say your target prefers milk over coffee, so you sit at the shop, wait for someone to match that description and kill them from your booth. (Ie, guy gets a coffee, but pours it out and asks for milk instead) You have to be careful, as there's a detective investigating murders nearby. However the patrons inside think he's the murderer but can't prove anything.\n\n\n\n\nThe owner of the shop, or at least the guy on the counter is a plant from your job, making sure you have the tools needed.\n\n\n\n\nGame is in British artstyle, akin to Yellow Submarine/Monty Python/We Happy Few, and takes place there.\n\n\n\n\nGame in first person\n\n\n\n\nGame is mostly point and click from the booth and waiting. For your first target, people will have a (!) over their head when they do an action that requires you to look carefully as they may match the target's profile or likes."
55s3rz,Play as Hal 9000,"Ever wondered what it would be like to be an A.I. plugged into a ship? Did you think GlaDos was a sympathetic character? Multiplayer game where one player is the A.I. on a spaceship. Help the crew, kill the crew, finish the mission or sabotage it. You would control everything the an A.I. would. The crew's goal would be to survive/shut you down. "
55q344,Tarzan Video Game,"An open world Tarzan game that takes you through the deep jungle, beaches and the ciry near the end. It will be POV have the running and climbing macanics like mirrors edge. A crafting system so Tarzan (you) can make Sling shots and Sticks to throw at the enemy.it will have a hunting system were you can eat bugs and small critters to survive. Have combat like Far Cry. The enemies will be Gorillas, Cheetas,Jaguars and hunters. The story will evolve around Tarzan meeting a girl and her showing him what human life is like while Tarzan is discoverd and tries to protect the girl from the hunters and hostile gorillas."
55pndw,2D Spore-like game,"So it sounds a bit like a 2D spore, but with more realistic goals.  The player can create a creature by selecting various options: carnivore/herbivore, wings, long/short legs, exo-skeleton, spikes (e.g. like a hedgehog), claws, sharp teeth etc...  Once the creature has been created, it is set free in the world, which is a side-on 2D view.  There are other random creatures, scenery like trees of various heights (some of which have fruit on them), water, and other elements that will be used as gameplay mechanics.\n\nThe aim is to create a creature that can survive as long as possible.  Depending on the design of the creature, it must eat either fruit/plants or other creatures. The more ""features"" the creature has (e.g. wings) the more it must eat to survive, but (for example) a creature with wings can reach fruit that is higher up, whereas a creature without wings may run out of food once all the low-hanging fruit has been eaten.  There are other creatures that may attack the player's creature.  If it has long legs it can run away faster, or if it has claws it can fight back.  Maybe the creature with the best chance of survival is a worm that can live underground?  However, all creatures need water at some point, so it has to visit a source of water regularly.  You get the idea."

55m0hn,An FPS set in total darkness,"An idea I had recently. Players can see a wire frame representation of the map so they can navigate properly. You will have to use a variety of tools to illuminate your enemies to shoot them. \n\nThe fun will be about how to illuminate your opponents without giving yourself away. Muzzle flash will illuminate you so you have to fire conservatively. \n\nYou can use flare guns to illuminate areas, but your opponents might spot you firing it. However, you can use this as a decoy to bait your opponents into firing a pot shot, so you can see them. "
55lt90,New Video Game idea,"Here's the new game that might sound fun: Undead University. It'll center around 5 to 7 university students between the ages of 21 and 26 who fight off zombies trying to escape their university, but their biggest obstacle in their way is a corrupt headmaster and govner."
55ldf4,Idea: Planet exporation and terraforming adventure game.,"**CONCEPT**  \n  \n* The player explores a planet to identify resources, determine habitability, and begin preparation for colonization.  \n  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n**PLOT**  \n  \n* (Optional) World space exploration agencies launch science platforms to attempt colonization suitability prepwork.  One ship falls through a wormhole (**not** black hole) and emerges nearby a planet remarkably similar to Earth, but with different landmasses.  The ship awakens the player, who then beams to the planet to start.  \n  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n**SETTING**  \n  \n* Earth-like planet, but reasonably should use different landmasses to allow creative designs with less player complaints about missing places.  \n* Map *could* be procedural generation, but that tends to create odd geography and you can't set checkpoints for objectives off of terrain as easily.  \n* Starting area limited to hexagonal grid; player must complete objectives to open more areas.  This allows for setting goals, as well as limiting total play area and creating an easy way to add terrain piecemeal (as dev progresses, or with expansions, or anything else).  \n  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n**CHARACTERS/ABILITIES**  \n  \nPlayer is the character; therefore classes/skill trees would define progression:  \n  \n* Scientist - Primary focus is on data collection and terraforming. Objectives could include:  \n * atmospheric testing and sounding,  \n * greenhouse/ O2 production,  \n * soil/mineral/water tests,  \n * and weather observations.  \n * (Optional) Could have specialties for higher levels.  \n  (Climatology, Geology, Oceanography, Botanist, Ecologist).    \n* Engineer - Primary focus is on creating solutions for terraforming and habitation. Objectives could include:  \n * greenhouse/ O2 production,  \n * mineral/ material extraction,  \n * facility/ equipment fabrication,  \n * virus/bacteria eradication,  \n * energy production and sustainment,  \n * and communication networks establishment.  \n * (Optional) Could have specialties for higher levels.  \n  (Environmental/Geotechnical, Chemical/Bio-Engineering, Electrical, Mechanical, Electronics/Computer)  \n* Explorer - Primary focus is on discovery and charting locations and objects. Objectives could include:  \n * charting landscape,  \n * determining site sustainment/ build locations,  \n * documenting weather/plants/animals,  \n * scouting viable food sources,  \n * crafting aid kits, \n * identifying trails/ shelters/ danger terrain,  \n * fielding data collection equipment at sites,  \n * and reporting suitable landing sites for supplies.  \n * (Optional) Could have specialties for higher levels.  \n  (Cartographer, scout, Field Medic, Mechanic, Researcher).  \n  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n**GAMEPLAY MECHANICS**  \n  \n* The primary mechanic is exploration.  \n* Players are limited by O2 levels and area charted by observation station.  \n* Replacement O2 could be available at core of hexagon.  \n* Completing certain objectives (based on class) could open more areas.  \n* Arm-mounted kit for appropriate class enables interaction modules for environment/ placed items (similar to omni-tool from ME series).  \n* (Optional) Vehicles may or may not be needed; Perhaps a buggy with container for storage.  \n  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n**POSSIBLE PLATFORMS**  \n  \n* Primary development likely easiest on PC.  \n* Could be built for/ported to 6th Gen consoles or higher, but I recommend 7th Gen or higher if this route chosen.  \n  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n**EXTRA/OTHER**  \n  \n* Could have multiplayer developed once main portion built, which would allow for different classes to trade and work together to terraform.    \n* Appeals to generic audience (lack of violence/gore/guns), but can be ""deep"".  \n* Little-to-no voice acting means some costs saved, although environment sounds and music still needed.  \n* Main issues terrain mapping, skill tree creation, character customization, and environmental interactions.  \n  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n**CREDIT**  \n  \n* I doubt anyone will actually use this, but if you do, just shoot me a link to the product page when you finish your project."

55jgtw,What kind of games would be fun in a klein bottle (which looks like a donut shaped tunnel except you wrap around to drive on both sides)?,"A klein bottle is a square that wraps around normally left/right and has a half twist wrapped forward/backward.\n\nExample: A racing game in that tunnel would put you on opposite sides of the same semi-transparent surface as those you've lapped (or have lapped you), and again on same side if laps differs by 2. If the ground sinks around all players, then about half the players would create valleys and the other half create hills, always seeing themself as creating a valley.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klein_bottle"
55iikj,MMO FPS RPG,"So i am a gun enthusiast. I know stuff about how guns work. And i think that some big company should make a proper MMO FPS RPG. \n\nBut here's the twist. you have to make your own guns. Engineer them. you'd have to get the parts to build a gun from scratch or buy them from other people who make them, however buying a gun will make it weaker so that you dont just buy guns and actually need to learn to make them. The way you make them will affect the gun's performance (recoil, damage, accuracy). You'd start the game off with a couple parts and a tutorial on how to make a pistol or something and you could have dungeon style areas to clear out enemies and get money and rare gun parts.\n\nYou could form assault teams with your friends and participate in a great war on a gigantic map against other factions. \n\nLand vehicles, Sea vehicles, Planes that can drop bombs, Transport planes, Helicopters, All that good stuff.\n\nConduct proper spec-ops attacks on enemy positions when they arent expecting it. Sneak in and eliminate everyone. Take the area and establish further planning with generals and other high-rankers.\n\nUnfortunately games that have promises like this may end up like No Man's Sky"

A game where you play as the captain of a massive cruise ship, but the closer you get to your destination, the less the passengers begin to behave.\n* 2. You are the president of the entire world. Unfortunately, you are also the slowest person on all of planet Earth. Try to do your job and get around the white house despite your *ridiculously* slow speed.\n* 3. A first person game where you must break out of your holding cell and escape the most secure prison on the planet which is where you are held.\n* 4. A game where lag is one of the main mechanics (e.g, every 5 or so seconds your controls stop responding, so you have to time your jumps/movement correctly, etc)\n* 5.

55fdw2,World of Lovecraft ( Cinematic story description inside ),"Contrary to what the title implies, this won't be a MMORPG like World of Warcraft, that was just a pun for the name. What I imagine is an open-world or semi-open world adventure, puzzle, action, exploration game, Kind of like a mix between Uncharted and Skyrim if you will, set in a Lovecraftian universe. And I have this vision playing out in my head of almost exactly how I image the game's plot starting and the mechanics, so as I promised, here's what the trailer would be like:\n\n*2016, Providence. A car is driving on with a heavy downpour of rain on the window, inside it, a frail, young man with spectacles is watching the streets rolling by. ""My name, is Albert Lovecraft. I am a student of history and anthropology. Most people know me in relation to my grandfather, Howard Phillips, a famous author of weird fiction here in my ancestral home city of Providence. They say I resemble him in many ways. I have always been more fascinated with the past than the present, and I find myself relating more to the fading words of forgotten manuscripts than the conversations of my peers. I'm reclusive, and I don't go out much. But part of that might be due to what most people don't know about me.""*\n\n*The car stops, and Albert steps out, entering the doorway of a rundown apartment building, walking up the stairs to his modest studio apartment, where he hangs his coat and fills some cheap whine into a cup. ""I'm not sure if this is the life I would've chosen, and not that it chose me, had things been different."", Albert takes his cup and moves on to a desk, mulling over some notes from his studies. ""Among the many writings from my grandfather that formed his biographies, he repeatedly said that he drew inspiration from his dreams for many of his stories. He was believed to be suffering from sleep paralysis, and claimed he was assaulted by horrific ""night gaunts"". But it is a fact known only to a few doctors that both me and my father before me had the same affliction. A peculiar coincidence, albeit not an extraordinary one since the illness might be partially heritable.""*\n\n*Albert closes his books and goes towards bed. ""But only I know, and my father, eager to avoid the topic which brought him much discomfort, merely hinted at, while attributing to an overly active imagination influenced by the family history, is that we share the very same vivid dreams which my grandfather did, with steady reappearances of specific locations and figures over and over again. It seems that my father experienced them more intensely than my grandfather did, and me more than my father, too. We are perceived to be eccentric enough as it is, and there's no point in stirring more glances by speaking about those dreams, even if it might prove a novelty to some. Certainly, I don't have any reason to believe this is anything more than what my father thought, that our imagination is simply reflecting the themes surrounding the family fame. As I've said, perhaps it was this that shaped my personality, as I've found myself waiting for sleep more than the day, with a mix of dread and wonder.""*\n\n*Albert curls up in his rickety bed, turns off the lights, and closes his eyes.*\n\nThis game is set in an alternate universe in which H.P Lovecraft had children. The prologue ends. The screen goes black, in the middle a loading symbol, transparent, in the shape of Cthulhu's head appears, slowly being filled up from it's tentacles with a green liquid to indicate progress. When it's done, a lighting flashes in the black screen. The camera starts panning down, revealing the black screen to be the night sky and below it a shady, 19th-century city with human NPC's in 19th century clothing, while a caption reads ""Arkham, Massachusetts"". Then it zooms in into a large, majestic building, penetrating through the walls, and portraying an antique classroom with many students and a stern professor next to a board, while a caption reads ""Miskatonic University"", with the professor rambling on about something, as the camera slowly shifts into the perspective of a yawning student. The professor snaps. ""Albert, what did I just say?"". The play is given a set of dialogue options to choose the correct reply, if he does then he is spared from being penalized early on in some way ( I.E missing item given by the professor that will have to be obtained later ). Anyway, the class is over, and the player steps out into the corridor of the university. Cinematic cutscenes are now finished and you can wander around, with a main questline given by the professor about something, while picking up potential side-quests from other folk in the university along the way, and then across Arkham itself when leaving it. \n\nThe quests would be mystery/puzzle/action based, where the player gets items along the way, clues in texts, needs to figure out what to use and where to go around the environment, make smart choices and deduce information from dialogues with NPC's to help him advance, sometimes using stealth trying to investigate a museum or crypt or something, sometimes using weapons like a revolver or creative ways to distract foes, whether human or monsters, and so on.\n\nAt this stage, the dream-albert protagonist is mostly unaware of the dream, going around doing stuff request of himself as a student in the fictional Miskatonic University, but as he completes objectives, he gains an experience bar of ""Lucidity"". When it's full at a certain point, it turns into a lucid dream, and many options for an area are unlocked. Dream-Albert is taken over by sleeping Albert, who also begins giving the player commentary on locations and so on based on H.P lovecraft's books, and devising a course of action with multiple choices based on what he learned from the affairs of dream-Albert. In addition, each time this happens in a new area, he also gains a ""superpower"" to select that makes it possible to do things he couldn't before, thanks to the ability to make a minor effect on the dream-world while in lucid state. So it could be some mind-reading, detecting hidden secrets, reanimate and talk to someone dead briefly ( Like Herbert West ), freeze a foe, and so on. After each chapter Albert wakes up, there's a cutscene in which he's talking about what happened and the next step, and then a new chapter starts when he goes to sleep again.\n\nOf course Arkham won't be the only area, the player will explore the famous locations of the Lovecraftian world like Innsmouth, Celephais, and so forth as the main quest goes on. The plot of the main quest line itself will be, during the course of his dreams following the adventures of Miskatonic University student, dream-Albert, real Albert slows begins to discover his dreams aren't just dreams, and the family curse is no coincidence. The ""dream-world"" is actually an alternate universe, and dream-Albert is his alternate reality version, who is the very parallel person that real Albert directly shared a consciousness with during dreams. Before that, Albert's father and H.P Lovecraft himself did not have such a link to their parallel version, which is why their dreams were more hazy and abstract, ( Just like H.P lovecraft's dreams really were ), while Albert's bond with that reality is the strongest.\n\nIt is also revealed that some of the Eldritch deities, themselves familiar with different universes or dimensions, have first begun sending these dreams to H.P Lovecraft who was deemed to be most receptive to them because of his character, so they could also take roots in the minds of men in ""our"" ( Game universe ) world, and transferring those dreams through Lovecraft's descendants, with the bond between them and the host growing stronger while anticipating it's climax in Albert Lovecraft, who is so tightly linked to their universe that he is synchronized with his parallel version. A portion of those Gods, who in all of Lovecraft's stories usually continue skulking after the protagonist escapes, or try to escape and fail, are now making their final move. If they can reach Arkham and catch dream-Albert, they will also be able to possess the mind of real-Albert and gain a foothold in the primary universe, which will allow them to start directly talking and influencing people's thoughts, eventually forming cults that could perform some ritual opening a gateway for them to enter physically as well. Their reasoning to rule over it is because the Arkham alternate universe is already too crowded by too many deities vying for it ( The rivalry between Great ones, Outer Ones, Deep Ones, etc.. ) and the humans inhabiting it also possessing more wards and supernatural abilities to thwart their efforts, while the primary universe is empty, ripe and defenseless. So one of those groups of Gods devised that plan.\n\nHalfway through the game or so, on top of realizing that, real albert also becomes immersed enough in their universe that he finds an ability to communicate with dream-albert, as well as that the reason he can exert the lucid superpowers in what is essentially an alternate universe is because he absorbed some of the essence of deities when they linked themselves to him and his parallel version, which grants him some of their power in the universe which they inhabit. Then the plot really picks up and they both set out to stop it from happening, looking for artifacts and characters and so on who could help, eventually reaching endgame locations like R'lyeh and so on to destroy them or at least their machinations, which although gets extremely risk if they catch Dream-Albert, they realize their cause is doomed if they let them invade Arkham and the rest of the world, or that they would just pick someone else in the future to send dreams to anyway.\n\nHowever, the game shouldn't be so linear and there's a twist. At some point it becomes apparently even with his advantages over all the protagonists of Lovecraft's stories, with Dream Albert's powers and Real Albert's knowledge from his grandfather, that he can't stop them completely by himself. Which presents an opportunity when soon enough other rival gods, be they also evil, just chaotic or good like the Nodens, soon learn of this and some begin fighting the original plotting gods for dominion on the new universe, while others try to prevent that from happening too.\n\nSo you get multiple storylines and dialogue options and quests in later locations in which the character encounters these Gods and can try to defeat them, strike a deal with some, do something for them, or so forth, and appropriate multiple endings for the adventure depending on the choices and consequences. For example, desperate to stop the other gods from ruining their desires, the originally responsible Gods offer Albert to betray dream-Albert and let them consume him and his world, but in return he will retain his autonomy in the real world and they will make him their high priest, giving him any nefarious pleasure or authority he wants. Or he sides with any other factions, for example the Deep Ones tell him they will only inhabit the new earth under the oceans and won't interfere besides some sacrifices from time to time, and then he joins them in quests against the other factions. Or he gets a failed ending and all the world is consumed, or a very difficult best ending in which he found all the artifacts and solved something that enabled him to spare the primary universe from the presence of any eldritch deities entirely."

55bbkw,Sim Emperor,"I would love to see a first-person empire-building game. I'm a software developer and could probably figure out most of the technical aspects, with the help of a game engine. Where I fall short is in the art department.\n\nWhat most empire-building games don't provide is a sense of how difficult it was before the dawn of high-speed communication just to hold an empire together. I'm envisioning a highly detailed, hyper-realistic economic, political and military simulator, wherein the player is an aspiring emperor, but instead of looking down on a 100% accurate, real-time representation of your domain, you are forced to rely upon either what your character can see directly or on information fed to you by other characters. The information may not be accurate. Perhaps the character is disloyal or insubordinate, or perhaps he is under duress. Maybe he doesn't even come back in one piece... \n\nOn the battlefield, the player would not be able to see a real-time overview of his forces. A plan of attack would be formulated before battle and individual commanders would be responsible for executing the plan (will they remain loyal?) Information about the status of forces would trickle in from messengers, but if they die on the way, then you will have no idea what's going on elsewhere on the battlefield.\n\nThe game would be very AI-heavy. In the early stages of the game, the player would engage in more micromanaging, overseeing the cultivation of his lands, the construction of defenses and other buildings, the marshalling of levies, the training and provisioning of troops, the purchase of equipment and tools, investment in trade ventures, and leading a small contingent of troops into battle in service of a liege lord. Later on, however, these minutia could be increasingly left to lieutenants, who exhibit more or less competence depending upon their skill levels (which will depend upon their age and experience.)\n\nThe game will run in real time with the ability to fast forward at different rates. If your serfs or citizens plant a crop, it will take months of real time for those crops to mature, unless you fast-forward. Any events requiring the player's attention will drop you back into real-time, where you can issue orders, fend off attackers, flee an assassination attempt, lead your troops into battle, etc.\n\nI would like to see this take on a level of realism that would make it an educational tool as much as anything else.\n\nHere's the part where everyone tells me what a bad idea this is..."

You have the option of creating another planet for the same system. Then you can cause 2 sentient, interstellar species to have a war. A sentient interstellar species can send their species to another planet to expand, if they can inhabit it.\n\n\nI'll add more the more I brainstorm.\n"

5b7jew,A Castlevania-inspired Squad-Based Platformer with a Twist,"Hey, guys. My idea is pretty simple - I've been mulling it over for about a year or so. The gist of it is that you control a team of people who venture into castes to rid of all the ghouls, monsters, and wisps that haunt the insides. The squad/party consists of a warrior, mage, and archer. However, the twist is, you can only control one at a time. You can rapidly switch between the three using number keys and utilize different strategies to take down the enemies in the castles.\n\nMy thought is that as the player progresses through the castles, they come across monsters and bosses that might not be tougher per se, but will require special strategies to defeat.\n\nBats can only be killed by the archer who can angle his attacks. Certain bosses may deal massive amounts of magic damage between far-spaced attacks, meaning that the mage's magic shield will absorb the damage while the warrior should bash away. ETC ETC.\n\nOverall, I don't think this would be too hard of a game to make, intermediate at best. Although, I think all the mechanics put together are arguably more intermediate than beginner. But, what are your thoughts? Could this be a fun game with an interesting mechanic, or might it be too clunky?"

5b6qt7,Ace 'n Club - Twisted Game of Poker,"This game is set in a sci-fi western town, more specifically in a saloon. The graphics are hand-drawn and cel-shaded (Borderlands 2 Style). Around 6 players (+1 dealer) can participate in one multiplayer match, or a 3vs3 team.\n\nIn the first stage of a match, the players spawn in front of the saloon, equipped with a revolver. They can go into the saloon, get a few drinks, chat with the barkeeper, team up or set up specific tricks (explained later).\n\nAt a specific point, indicated with a countdown, one player is selected as the poker dealer, and all players sit down to a poker table. The poker game starts, and everyone is determined to win.\n\nBut some players might not want to play fair, maybe they brought some own cards into the game, or secretly partnered with another guy. There are also some tricks and traps a player can set up, such as a mirror to see other's cards, or a bribed dealer. Every player is also free to grab/switch out/take anything he likes, as long as he doesn't get caught.\n\nIf a player A notices an other player B acting suspiciously, he can pop up an ingame menu to state his suspiciousness. If the ""report"" gets send correctly and player B actually pulled that trick, player A can pull his revolver out and shoot B. The game then continues.\n\nThe problem is that this ingame menu is also visible for other players, so if player B notices player A sending a report about him, he can shoot A before the report is send. However, shooting a player without filling out a report about him first, or filling out a wrong report, is heavily punished by removing some money from player B.\n\nIn order to avoid getting shot, player A could stand up from the table and go to the toilet, filling out the report there, or drop under the table to do it ""secretly"".\n\nThe game ends if all but one player lose their money, or if one player is the last one standing. (If a player loses all of his money, he gets kicked from the table and joins as spectator. This prevents shooting all other people in order to win.)\n\nThe possibilities for tricks are nearly endless, and the gameplay of shooting and avoid getting shot is a good mechanic for this particular game.\n\nIf you think this is missing something, feel free to comment :)"
5b3skt,Ideas for a text simulation game,[deleted]
5b3r3i,A mech pilot game vr (first time here),"So I was playing d.va in overwatch and wondered why there weren't already mech games for things like the vive.\n\nMost of them seem to be these cartoony graphic wand toy games. But why couldn't you make a game where you acted as a mech pilot and the (in this case vive) hand controllers acted as the joysticks to pilot the robot. Basically everything people hoped titanfall would be.\n\nMotion controls:\n\nNaturally the vive/vr headset controls your orientation\n\nTilting the controllers moves you \n\nVarious weapons and systems could be equipped and switched between using the direction pads on the vive controllers and equipped to each side individually. Just a few examples;\n\n* A projected shield\n\n* Miniguns\n\n* Rockets\n\n* Cloaking\n\n* Radar drones\n\n* Repair drones\n\n* Mines\n\n* Flares\n\nMechs could be outfitted with various thrusters like ones to hover, some that just boost you forward like rockets or some for an instant retreat activated by jerking both controllers sideways like this (- -) \n\nWeapons are fired with the triggers on the controllers.\n\nAlso various mods can be equipped for more passive effects like tank treads for more ground speed (or maybe that would just replace the thrusters) spider like less that would allow the mech to latch onto walls. Heavier armor that reduces speed. \n\nGiven these controls any number of game types could be applied. From mobas where the mechs March through jungles and open fields to assault an enemy base, to arena shooters where you are blasting the enemy team apart. \n\nI'd play the shit out of a real mech pilot game."

For example, 10 categories, 10 points in each.\n\nLeveling up, you can switch them on the fly and absolutely crush enemies. 90 points in melee attack to kill one monster, then a split second later 90 points in ranged defense to block an attack.\n\nIt's very high-risk, high-reward. You need good reflexes to rearrange them on the fly. Also, you can only rearrange a few points at first. So you have to level up before you do anything crazy."
5az8hn,A Mad Max VR game,"Modify your car, smash it, repair it, shoot out of it, fist fight on top of it, focus on doing all of these things while on the move/being pursued for extra tension. I wish there was something like this without VR cause I'm poor, but a VR version would probably be far superior. I am aware that a Mad Max game exists, but IMO its lack of focus on vehicles and open world were areas of missed potential. \n\n\nLate edit: Just thought I'd add that the cool thing here IMO is letting a massive detailed world be explored even though you can only free move in like a 10ft*10ft box of space. A big challenge here would be keeping the player from straying too far from the car, and thinking about this I wondered how you could have a person there telling you to stay by the car. Perhaps you're driving against your will, kinda like Furiosa early in Fury Road. Or hell, maybe a chain is tied to you (also found in Fury Road). I'll also state the obvious and say that this style of driving combat game could be set in space, the old west...anywhere that has some mode of transportation really. I do think the sound of flooring a muscle car in VR would be amazing though."
5ax699,I need ideas,"So, I'm in the 7th grade. I've been recently developing small games that me and my friends can test out. I wanted to do something bigger. The chance was actually out, my school is doing a project sort of thing, which we do something we're passionate about, I am passionate about developing video games. I am personally one to be creative, but recently I felt like I'm on developer block, and I need ideas. I know how to code, and stuff. I just need ideas, so I can blow my classmates minds."

5ajdnm,Espionage Asset Management (Case Officer),"I have one specific idea that could be implemented in different ways. The basic concept is that the player is a case officer in the CIA or some other intelligence agency. The player's job is to recruit assets for the agency through a number of ways. The player analyzes the history and psychology of different people, determining whether or not they are a viable asset. If yes, the player must devise a plan on how to approach and turn the asset. The potential assets may be politicians, foreign rebel groups (taking sides in a civil war, i.e), civilians sympathetic to the agency's cause, or enemies. There would be selective option trees to select plans of action and dialogue trees to select the best way to persuade an asset. Using the asset's history and psychology, some approaches may be more effective than others. "
5aigcl,sphincter control.,"so basically the point of the game is to move your little poop-dudes from orifice to orifice. main challenge is getting the sphincter to open either in the correct order or thru little mini-games things or something like that. definitely a steam game, 2-d scrolling or 3rd person not sure how to say. buffs like diarehha and debuffs like constipation. could have a human centipede level. other challenges likes different kinds of stomach parasites, sicknesses like flu or food poisoning, tapeworm etc. maybe purchasble buffs like pepto bismol, gas x. could literally put every kind of fart or poop joke imaginable in voice-overs. would be fun as hell i think."

5af96a,In-game mechanic: I wish more multiplayer shooters implemented a mechanic of which respawning takes increasingly longer after each time the player dies.,"But of course NOT in Death Match games. (Of which I am not personally a fan of.)\n\nBut in objective-based game types, such as CTF or three-plots. Or Battlefield's Conquest. It can be implemented after an X amount of time to break a stalemate.\n"
5af6al,Outpost (Multiplayer FPS centering on Base Raiding),"The idea for this is simple. You and 1 to 29 of your friends are now a part of a mercenary company that you have incorporated. It's your first mission in the war torn country of (fill in the blank). You spawn into the world. It's nearly 200 km square of small towns and forests. Your first mission is to find a suitable place for an outpost. This is where the game separates itself from others.\n\nYou and your friends are alone in this current map. You have terrible weapons and some shovels and axes. You get to designate a 500mx500m square as your outpost. Here, you can dig into the ground down to 6 feet or so. Cut down trees for wood. Use branches for concealment. The only requirements are that you have 1 tent per two people and a tactical operations center in your outpost. The rest is up to you. \n\nDuring build mode you can't be raided, or gain any money from your actions. Just use the current resources you have available and the sweat off your brow. Once you find yourself with a few trenches and defense strategies, your team moves into the TOC and readies up for survival mode.  Once activated, your team must survive continuously for up to 10 minutes. After which, you will receive a monetary bonus. You can choose to take it and go back to build mode, or double down for more money and more risk. The risk comes from other players, who, at their TOCs, have a list of current potential targets to hit. \n\nLet's say they decide on your place, they choose their load outs and head out. They are spawned a certain distance away from you without your knowledge. They do not know your current location, but based on the size and advancement of your group/outpost they receive indications of which general area(s) to look for your outpost. This is done on a scale to protect smaller groups and to make things more challenging for mega groups. Before they embark they also get an intel report on your size, but this is not wholly accurate either. If you have 4 players on your team, the enemy might see it as (3 to 7 men). Once they find you, the gameplay plays out like any real world raid on an outpost would. Depending on the teams tactics and methods really determines the winner. The attacking team must make it to the defending teams TOc within a certain period of time. If they do so, they receive some money but if they don't they lose money.\n\nIf the base is destroyed in the process of the raid, the enemy team does not take it over. It is given back to the defenders after the round to rebuild and repair. This discourages griefing.\n\nEach round is a gamble and the worse thing to happen per round is a loss of money which could be turned around by surviving the next attack or attacking someone else. Also, money seems to be ever present in games but with nothing to spend it on. With a long list of black market items to choose from ranging from nicer weapons, new uniforms, better defensive measure, nicer building materials, mini games to play in the outpost if you're bored of raiding (dirtbike races?), people would rarely get bored. \n\nAlso other missions could be available from protecting a convoy on your map, fighting for town control in another map, to regular mounted patrols through the area. I think these core game mechanics of base building, realistic FPS combat and outpost advancement would make for a game very few would put down. Let me know your thoughts! Obviously not a game developer here but if anyone could make it or be inspired by it that would be sweet.\n\nSide thoughts\n\nrealism is a big +\nallow helicopters but make them painfully difficult to use without a HOTAS setup\nkeep everything grounded in reality. Think more Arma, less Rust"
5af0ja,Space Politics Game,"Well, I doubt this well ever get made but it would be something I would love to play, so here goes nothing.\n\nBasic Overview:\nSo Basically at the start of the game you get to design your political character, now I'm proposing a futuristic space theme because I love Sci-Fi but honestly this could probably done just as well in a Historical/Fantasy setting or heck probably even a modern setting. You would choose your culture, and this would give you a voting base among that culture, say a modifier like: +25% chance to vote you. Maybe some cultures could give other modifiers or have different event chains in game differentiating them more. Anyhow next you would pick traits, now this is where the game gets its replay ability. You can be a complete racist ass, and if you can convince enough people to vote for you still make it in office. \n\nI would comment more on the individual traits, but I think that would be up to the game maker and not me. Anyways after you have selected your character and made him you would load into the game. For the interface depending on the scope of the game you could go with something CK2ish but I think that may still be too large. Your basically going to start as a low Governor/[Insert whatever title the genre is in fits] and try to work your way up. Now for the game mechanics and what you can do.\n\nYou should have a map of the game as the default screen, with 1 or 2 map modes, I dunno maybe a Standard and a Poltical Map. Anyways the premise is you located in a large empire (STILL DEMOCRATIC) and you have to make sure your elected as head of the Empire, so basically president. That's the win condition however how you get there is up to you, and maybe if the game needed more content you could add a war system... BLAH BLAH BLAH. Too complex probably anyways so you start as a governor and you have a map, a decision tab (lots more about that later), Favors, Funds, Popularity Screen and Political Hierarchy Screen/Scandals. \n\nSo here is the basic run down of what all those do: \n\nFunds, you guessed this is your dosh screen, your money whatever currency insert here. Now I don't think you should lose the game if you run out of funds but it probably would severely screw you since in the decision tab you'd have to lend some from a Corporation/[Whoever has money in the genre your working in] and this would make you owe them a favor which can really hurt. How you make money, you should make money from your office and from whom ever you receive money.\n\nThe Favors Screen is essentially who owes you a favor, and whom you owe a favor. Now how many factions are in the game and who they are what they want so on, is up to who ever is willing to try this idea but essentially if they owe you a strong, medium, or weak favor you can ask for something in return. Example: You helped the corporation pass a law that reduced taxes for them, they owe you a medium favor. You cash the favor in for I don't know money/political support or maybe you even leave the favor and cash it for better relations with that faction, making them likely to back you in an election if your friendly. \n\nPopularity Screen\nSo this should show what issues are very important for people in your Planet/[INSERT HERE] and essentially what you should try to tackle if you want to stay popular. However you can of course lie and... that's for the decision tab. It should also show your popularity and if you are estimated to win the election. Now if you lose your election, you probably would lose the game but that's up to the creator not me.\n\nPolitical Hierarchy/Scandals\nSo this could be a split screen maybe two separate screens, anyhow what's in them is what's important, so basically the hierarchy shows who is highest to lowest, in a pyramid so going from President/[Insert Genre Specific Title Here] to Planetary Governor/[Just whatever]. The Scandal tab could show: Corruption Exposure of a certain politician, Sex related scandals ranging from whatever you find comfortable putting in the game, Illegal/Criminal Activity, Pure Lies. And these would of course add modifiers to the politician the exact numbers are up to the designer.  \n\nDecision Tab\nNow this is where really the gameplay comes in, you could really make it as real as possible. Of course adding more features is also a lot of work so its up to you how much of what I'm suggesting should be added but here are my suggestions. \n\n- Give Statements (So lets say a Politician was disgraced by a scandal, you could give a statement saying He was in the wrong, or The accusation is wrong or He did nothing wrong. Depending on what you say peope could be very angry, If you could make a type in screen [Pretty sure that's impossible] would be awesome)\n\n- Election Promises (So lets say a issue is Education you could say I will make education great again. Now if you don't fulfill those promises reelection might be difficult, could have a bad modifier for support or something)\n\n- Laws (So this would be a big one, you could pass all sorts of laws (IF YOU HAVE ENOGUH CONGRESS SUPPORT) but I'm leaving the logistics to whoever actually attempts this project.)\n\n- Influence Congress (So you could influence Congress and make them in favor of a certain law, etc.)\n\n- Throw Dinner Parties for a Faction (Improve relation at the expense of wealth.)\n\n- Donate to the Unfortunate (Increase overall support for your cause.) \n\n- Choose a Political Party (Increase Congress Support, or something like that. Could have influence on Laws.)\n\n- Shady Business (This would be High Risk High Reward stuff, like getting more money at the risk of a massive scandal and stuff like that.)\n\n- Marriage (This could be a big one so I just think it should have some political ramifications.)\n\n- Borrow money (Would owe a favor to the faction borrowed from.)\n\n- etc. (This list could go on forever like honestly: Interviews, Press Conferences. I have to stop myself)\n\nTL;DR: CK2 meets Democracy 3, sort of not really ohm, Guild 2 compares without the business aspect and really fleshed out politics system. \n\n\n\n"

5a9yme,Developer's block,"So I'm making a choice text-based game. It's like Civilization, but you have to dive deeper into actually running your country (speaking to citizens, maintaining good relationship with advisors)\n\nRight now I have a few values: population, happiness, workers, UN support, money, date, and a few hidden ones. The thing is that the game is supposed to be long-lasting (you open the game, make a few choices and then go and do other stuff), and there is nothing to hook someone for short periods of time. I was thinking of adding a variable that would be crucial for the whole game (if it's too low you lose, if too high... then something) but I can't think of such a variable that would make such a drastic difference.\n\nAny suggestions would be kindly appreciated."
594ztl,Robot Card Game,"**Summary:** Basically, a game where you build a deck and battle against other people / AI.  Almost like yu-hi-oh except that it shouldn't be as complicated, should be much more fast paced, shorter rounds and only revolves around robots and stuff.\n\n**Cards:** So when building a deck, there are a few different types.  The first is your robot cards.  They are the most important ones as they are the ones that allow you to attack/defend.  Each one has two types which define the metal and fighting style.  There are also ""build"" and ""scrap"" attributes which I will get into more.  Finally, there is a strength and defense amounts.\n\nNext, there are weapon/shield and armor cards.  Each of these will have a metal and/or fighting type attached to it.  These will allow the player to know which bot cards they can be attached to.  They will have a ""scrap"" amount as well as the strength/defense differentials.\n\nFinally, we have the boost cards.  These cards do not have any types or ""scrap"" amount.  These cards will effect designated/specified or all bot cards or your ""Core"" (again be explained soon).\n\n**Battle Map:** So the map would be a basic place mat type thing similar to the mat for yugioh.  On the left you would have the trash yard and the scrapyard, in the middle you would have 4 positions (3 in front and one in the back), and on the right you will have the deck and your core health.\n\n* scrap - the accumulation of the scrap value of cards in the scrapyard.\n* build - number of scrap pieces needed to play (""build"") the card.\n* core - The players energy core (equivlent to the LP in yugioh)\n* Front positions - The front positions are just normal positions with slots for the weapon/armor cards.\n* Back position - is meant for the main defense and has extra slots for weapons/armor.  This position will also double the defense of the bot card there (before upgrades).\n\n**Playing:** So, when a match starts the player who goes first cannot attack on the first turn.  On any other turn, it goes as follows:\n\n* Draw a card\n* Manage cards\n* Attack\n* End\n\n**Manage cards:** When laying a card there must be a sufficient amount of room on your side of the board.  During your manage portion, you are allowed to move cards from the position to the scrap yard.  After a robot is placed, you can add any upgrade cards to it that you have.  This is also when you would play your boost cards.  If you play a card with a build amount, cards in the scrapyard with a cumulative scrap amount adding to the same or higher must be moved to the trash yard.  you cannot scrap a card that you just laid down on your current turn.\n\n**Attack** When your robots are destroyed, they are moved to the scrapyard but you only receive half of the scrap points of the bot (and the full value of attached cards).  When a robot attacks, they must attack one of the front bots first, followed by the rear bot before being able to attack the core.  \n\nWhen attacking a card, it will always be your attack - their defense.  Even if the attack is smaller, the damage will be calculated and the defense will be lowered to the new amount (see extra for more info).  When a card is destroyed, any remainder of the attack value is left unused.  It will not have any effect towards other cards or the enemies core.\n\n**Extra:** As far as calculating the defense, I realize that it may seem flawed with being able to swap out the upgrade cards but I do have a whole system panned so it would remain fair and there would be no way to ""cheat"" the system.\n\nAlso, I was going to tag the game idea as beginner because most of it would be really simple and quick.  But because I think it would have to have an online portion and/or AI, I bumped the flair up to intermediate.\n\nThanks for the read, let me know what you guys think!"

591nyl,A strategy-shooter set in an alternate history,"So my idea isn't that ambitious (hopefully), but it as as follows: An online FPS with a multiplayer campaign, so every multiplayer battle you win and lose counts towards the outcome of your campaign. It's not hyper-deep, as there's only 2 end outcomes but the challenging thing is that the devs would have to make the first operation, than 2 for the outcome of that, than 2 each for the outcome of those, and so on. My favorite part of my idea, however, is the merger between strategy and shooter- basically, the team elects a general or whatever you want to call them to lead their team. The defending general could choose the objectives such as selecting capture areas or whatnot. They could then give orders to their team and set spawn points during the battle. The attacking general could give orders, select landing spots and determine the troop's movements such as telling them to flank. If a general is being a complete douche, then the team can also vote him back out of the position. This next idea is optional, but the general could only be given a set number of credits for vehicles and machine guns. Of course, there would also be normal multiplayer matches excluding the campaign feature. So, what do you think? I'm new to Reddit so if this post isn't flared then sue me."

5912l3,Small RPG/Fighting Game Idea,"I've been thinking about this game idea for a little while now.\n\nWhen you start the game, there would a small CaC that lets you choose your gender, build, skin tone, eye color, hair, and basic clothes. When you finish creating your character, you will be set into a small gym in front of a punching bag. This is when you will learn the basics of the game. After the tutorial, you can chose between three different ""schools"", which effect what skills you will learn as your character levels. After that, your only goals are to get stronger and to one day become the master of your school. \n\nBasics of gameplay: \nThe combat is divided into two rounds per person with a 15 second time limit for each. The two rounds being defensive planning, and offensive action. The rounds will continue to cycle until someone is defeated. After the battle, regardless of win or lose, you will gain experience. With enough experience, your character will level up, and you'll gain ""training points"". These are points you can use to train your attributes and skills.\n\nBasics of combat: \nWhen in battle, you go through two rounds of planning before actions occur. For the defense round, you choose between three defensive skills; Block, parry, and dodge. For each of these skills you have to decide if you'll use the skill as a high-defense, mid-defense, or low-defense. If you chose the right height for any of these defensive skills, it will have a positive effect for you and either no effect, or negative effect for your opponent. \n\nFor your offensive rounds, you chose between your offensive skills (like punches, kicks, throws, etc.), and a height of attack (high, mid, low). If your attack lands successfully past your opponent's defense, you will damage them with the possiblity of giving them a negative effect (if the skill has a chance to inflict one).\n\nAs you level up, the combat will get more complex, and will allow you to use more than one offensive and defensive skill per round. \n\nMisc: When you fight, you can money which you can use to purchase clothing and weapons. I also think it would be interesting if you can save up to purchase your own dojo/gym to invite others to fight with you in. \n\nSorry if this seems like a big ramble! But I really feel like this can happen if a developer would like the idea.  \n\n\n \n"
590x23,Kingdom Creator game,"Intro:\n\nI am currently working on a game which is similar to prison architect and rimworld's style of play, but the player has to design a medieval kingdom/castle. \n\nPlayer Aims:\n\nWhile creating their castle/kingdom, the user must manage the increasing population by producing housing, assigning jobs, and creating recreational space so the population happiness does not decrease.\n\nMain Features:\n\nThe player will have the ability to;\nCreate and destroy walls and rooms (details outlined below),\nAllocate members of the population to specific roles (details outlined below),\nDefend the castle from invading armies and seiges,\nHold public trials and executions for miscreants,\nManage population classes (i.e peasants, middle class, etc.),\nand much more.\n\nRoom Types:\n\nThe initial room types that i have come up with are as follows;\nResidential,\nGuard room,\nThrone room,\nJail,\nTreasury/vault,\nGreen space/recreational area,\nTraining yard (for soldiers),\nCourtyard (for holding public executions),\nand more will be added as development progresses.\n\nPopulation Roles:\n\nEach member of the population (once they reach a certain age) can be assigned to a certain role from the list below.\nKing/Queen,\nKnight,\nGuard (soldier/archer),\nBlacksmith,\nBaker,\nExecutioner,\nMerchant,\nPeasant.\nAt the moment this role will not be able to be changed once selected.\n\nThe Jail System:\n\nThroughout the gameplay, members of the population may cause trouble, to sort this out, the guards will throw the perpertrators into jail. The user can then decide the fate of the miscreants, depending on the severity of their crime. They can either be given a fixed sentence of a certain amount of days, or they can be sentenced to death by public execution. Players should be careful when choosing punishments that are too severe for the crime commited can decrease population happiness. \n\nPopulation Happiness:\n\nThroughout the game, certain events will cause population happiness to either increase or decrease. The player must be careful of this as if the happiness becomes too low then a riot will take place and if the king is killed it is game over. On the plus side, if the population is kept happy, income from merchants and other shops will increase, causing the player to earn more money from taxes, meaning they can upgrade more.\n\nI have just outlined the basics of the game i am making and any ideas you may have are welcome. I also havent thought of a name for the game yet so if anyone has any ideas for that then please let me know.\n"

You are low on health so you buy a health potion and drinks it. After you drank it, your in-game's health increase. But your increasing real life heartbeats will trigger the emergency protocol of the VR set, and the game will temperately shut down itself, and now, you are back to real life.\n\nYou look at the label of the ""health potion"". It was a bottle of detergent. So now you have your new quest of Real Life: Find a bottle of laxative before you are poisoned to death. And after you did, you calmed down and your heartbeats get slower. The VR set detected it, shut down the emergency protocol, and the game restarts itself, you are now stuck again.\n\nLosing the game is not possible, since if you do so the VR set would continue to run on a blank screen until it overheats and explode. There are only two ways to win the game: Get to your company through the chaos mixing of real and virtual worlds and asked for the designer to remove it. Or win the game, which automatically shut it down.\n\nBy the way, I don't think this is possible for VR support since the current VR technology isn't this advance. So, maybe PC or console."
58sxsk,Make a mankind simulator where the mind of humans can be adjusted between acting for the own well-being to acting for the well-being of all humans and nature,The idea is originated by thoughts why mankind destroys the planet and also creates things like wars or the financial industry that just drain resources without creating anything productive. So i wonder if being more eusocial might avoid certain problems mankind currently faces. 
58qtad,[request] A Management/Strategy Casual Mobile Game,So I want to make some kind of casual mobile game that is based around management and also some strategy.

58pp0h,Cigarette Making Sim 2016,I was watching some YouTube videos based on cigarette reviews when the idea came to me.Hey why not make a cigarette making simulator? I first thought of a sandbox title where you get rated based on some stats but it could quickly evolve into a tycoon game like Software Inc. for example.The sandbox is pretty self explanatory.You have some ingredients and you mix the together to make a cigarette of your dreams.Imagine making new Marlboro Reds or something.I'm a programmer myself so if anyone is interested in doing some art please PM me.I only need artists since I made a few games and I know my stuff.Here is the link to my games:\nhttps://zvonimirr.itch.io/\n\nI envisioned the game to be in 2D but if anyone is willing to make tons of 3D models I wouldn't mind seeing a low-poly game.
58pk3i,"""Trust""","So this is a game idea I have been kicking around since playing dead by daylight. I love the idea of one player randomly being assigned to hunt all of their friends but I wanted to take it a step farther. Game setting doeskin really matter but for the first iteration of the game it would be in a Clue esque mansion. The team of players would all spawn in together and one of them would be given a notification that they were the killer. \n\nThe object of the killer is to eliminate all the other survivors using the tools given to them without getting caught. They would be visually indistinguishable from the other survivors. who are tasked with missions to escape the mansion by completing mini games spread through out the mansion for which there is no map so finding and completing the objectives in time requires them to spread out. The killer would have to blend in with his ""team"" and slowly kill them off by setting up traps and using times poisons. He can uses them to make it look like other survivors are the killer instead of himself. \n\n\nThe surviving team can vote to kill one of their ""peers"" (as long as there are 4 or more including the killer left alive)  if they believe they know who the killer is. If they are right then they win but the whole team loses if they are wrong.\n\n\nAs the killer progresses they will be given access to more and more ways to kill the other survivors to the point when there are only 3 left he gets access to blatant weapons such as a gun.\n\nCan be played by anywhere from 3-20 players but I think would be most fun in groups of 6 friends where their trust for each other would be the physiological factor the leads to players past relationships factoring into accusing each other of being the murders. \n\nAKA friendship destroyer simulator 2016\n\n\n"

58kjjg,DO NOT ADULT! A game about being an a**hole.,"So this game would be a story based, single player game. \n\n The games level will start with a short intro video describing the situation your character is in. Character wakes up in the morning to screaming children and angry wife. Character go to work and gets yelled at by boss. So on, so forth. Then, you will take control of the character and not do what you should do, but rather what you should not. So instead of apologizing to your boss, your smack him in the face with a dildo and pee in his coffee. Instead of consoling your wife when she screams at you, you poop in her shoe. These are random, made up on the spot ideas but it could be a really funny game to jump into 20 minutes at a time. It would also be really cool to have a text chat system like Facade had, where you could type your own responses to characters in the world and see their reactions. \n\nEvery ""level"" would be a scenario the character is in. A couple of scenarios would form the characters day. After every day you would be given a rating of how good are bad you were and the relationships your character had with other characters in the game world would change based on your reactions. Kind of like a ""standing"". Anyways, just a small idea I was thinking of that might be some mindless fun! \n\nI for one would love to show up to work 1 1/2 hours late naked to poop on Sharon's desk and leave. \n\nAnd wouldn't it be cool if there was a ""stealth"" mode where you're nice to people's face and you do evil stuff behind their back to cause chaos? \n\n""Yes boss, I did get you the coffee  you asked for. \n""No boss, i didn't notice that rat poo in there.""\n\nDumb but fun.

58kc1d,VR Mall - Social VR Hangout For HTC Vive!,"I think it would be so sick if they made a VR Mall that was free to download, but the stores were real clothing stores you could buy from. Clothes and products get shipped to your house after you virtually buy them and you would get a virtual copy of it for your character. And lets say you don't want to buy the real product for your self but for your character, the game could have a virtual currency to buy only the virtual item. Players with the HTC Vive could meet up in this virtual mall and hang out (kinda of like Rec Room for HTC Vive) play games in a arcade, watch movies and other little things, have food fights in the food court fun things you would never get to do in a real mall."

58awwh,Medieval Game Idea,"A simple online game where each player chooses a role of either the king, one of the king's man-at arms, or one of the king's various noble knights. On the other hand the opposing team will assume the role of either the Black knight, one of the Black knight's mercenaries, or one of the Black knight's personal knights.\n\nVarious maps can be featured with an array of different Castles. The main mode will be the Castle siege where the king and his men must defend against the Black knight's incoming forces. Other modes may include a duel mode, joust mode, team deathmatch, or capture the flag.\n\nVarious weapons may be used such as swords, bows and arrows, shields, axes, spears, javelins, crossbows and Cavalry with mounted men wielding weapons of all sorts.\n\nThe game should be playable in both first and third person views and should use some kind of combat system that is simple and whose controls are easy to learn.\n\nSiege weapons may be included such as siege towers, ladders to climb castle walls, Battering rams, etc.\n\nThe king will wear his crown and a suit of armor with a royal cape.\n\nThe king's knights will all be wearing full plated armor concealing their entire bodies and are slightly tougher stronger than their allies who are the king's men-at-arms.\n\nThe King's regular soldiers will then choose from different soldier classes including swordsman, horseman, Archer,\nThese classes will be allowed to choose weapons according to their class e.g.. Archers will use bows and crossbows while swordsmen will use shields and swords and lances etc. They will wear various types of helmets and armor.\n\nThe Black knight will have a full suit of black armor covering his entire body with a red feather coming off his helmet\n\nThe Black knight's knights will wear full suits of black armor as well with the distinction between the Black knight and his knights being a red feather coming off of the Black knight's helmet.\n\nThe Black Knight's mercenaries will then also be allowed to choose from various classes such as horseman, Archer swordsman. They will wear a distinctive type of armor similar to that of atilla the hun and his men. With various helmets and armor to choose from.\n\nThe combat system would be similar to that of Skyrim: Elder scrolls V. \n\nPlayers can Sprint and players will not run out of stamina.\nPlayers will regenerate health while standing still.\n\nThe aim of the players who assume the role of the Black knight and his men will try to kill the king within a certain time limit while the kings men defend him.\n\nThe aim of the king's knights and their men will be to protect the king while attempting to kill the Black knight and his Knights.\n\nPlayers will be automatically and fairly placed as a different character each time a new round starts. \n\nThe round ends when time runs out or the king or Black knight is Killed.\n\nAll characters have the ability to ride horses and to attack while on the horse using various weapons such as bows and arrows, swords and shields, lances, spears, javelin etc.\n\nThe King and Black Knight may write personal messages to their respective teams to convey tactical orders.\n\nThe game should at least facilitate 16 players per side if not more... With at least 3 knights per side...each time a knight is Killed on either side the position opens up for a soldier or mercenary to assume the role of a new Knight.\n\nThe Game can be Called CAMELOT .\n\nThoughts? :)"

Some of the games my ideas have been too similar to are games like P.T., Half-Life 1, BioShock and some others.\n\nSo now I wanted to ask this wonderful sub if you guys had any ideas, as it would be a big help to me.\n\nThanks in advance!"
5cg0fv,2D Giant Space Battleships,"So the mechanics of the game is that you're controlling a large spaceship, with multiple turrets mounted on top of it. The turrets could have fixed positions that do high damage, manual aim that does medium damage, and auto aim that does low damage. The game mode would essentially be a 3v3 or 2v2 domination, and the objective of the game would be to capture the opponent's base while defending your own with your teammates. There would be neutral bases in-between where players can get ammunition and repairs and nebulas that provide invis. Outside of the main game, players would be able to upgrade and modify their ships for different roles and functions with money gained from a match. Would this be an interesting idea?"
5cdf6a,The One-Bullet-Experience,"This idea was inspired by, ironically, the sample idea in the sticky post.\n\nBasically, this is a lightweight 3D Shooter with minimalistic graphics and Multiplayer/Bot Mode. The key idea of the game is simple: You only have one bullet.\n\nYou start with a simple weapon you can choose yourself, maybe a revolver, a sniper, a shotgun or a pistol, and a knife. The difference between the weapons is simply the damage loss in distance, or different visors (Meaning, you'll deal less damage with a shotgun in the distance than a sniper). However, you only have one bullet in your gun.\n\nIf you shoot a enemy, the bullet instantly respawns in your gun, that means you can shoot as long as you don't miss. If you miss, you lose your bullet and it respawns a few seconds (maybe 10 seconds) after. If you and your enemy both lose your bullets, you can draw your knifes and start stabbing each other.\n\nSince the shooting system of the game could be easily implemented, the game could instead focus more on movement abilities or customization of guns or character.\n\nIf you think otherwise or would like to contribute, please leave a comment and like."

5c0hla,Help me make an idea simple and innovative,"Hello, \n\nI have an idea that I'd like to finish in 3 days (can't take more than that). I would like help with making it simple (scope) and making it new. You can propose a new idea instead of what I proposed but it has to be doable in 3 days. The game should be a mobile game. Last thing to consider it has to use free art from Kenney's collection or GameDevMarket.net (Free section). At the moment I can't afford to get art. \n\n**The idea:**\n\nThe game revolves around you being a shopkeeper that has some helpers (heroes). You can equip your heroes with equipment and choose where they can adventure. \n\nWhen you choose where they adventure you choose which ingredients they will find (ingredients based on location). Combat happens automatically (like clicker like games) and you can only affect the outcome by providing better equipment to your heroes. \n\nYou start with 1 hero then more people get to ask you to recruit them. They get you more materials, you can make more and better equipment and then defeat more dungeons. \n\nThe whole thing is played through menus and choosing multiple options. \n\nEDIT: I thought of a rest system where if you don't have your heroes rest after X amount of fights, they will get tired and their performance will drop. If you continue to abuse them, they'll strike and quit. Effectively it would work similar to real life.\n\nWhat do you guys think?\n\nNote: Definitely will credit whoever I'll use their ideas in game. \n"
5bxi8m,An apocalyptic group survival game.,"I got this idea while watching Robbaz's latest fallout video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXIc9Uv6GWU\nHe moves his settlement to another location and goes through several dangerous locations with a large amount of NPCs.\n\nHow about an fps game set in an apocalyptic world. You're responsible over a group of like 20 or so people that had to flee their last hide-out for [reason X].\n\nThe gist of the game is that you have a long road to follow and on certain locations there are cities, settlements, bandits, ambushes, abandoned houses, etc.\n\nThe people in your group have basic means of defending themselves at first likes knives or a pistol with limited ammo but you get to loot after a conflict or when you come across an abandoned location and you get to decide who gets what. You can do it manually or let the computer decide for you which is useful at first since it would be too much work to care about every member individually but as people die in your group you slowly start to get attached to certain individuals and you can prioritize them. There could be situations where you gain members like when you come across a friendly settlement but there could also be conflicts in the group itself which you have to resolve. A lack of food for a long time could also cause members to die or leave your group.\n\nEach person has his or her own name and some have a short backstory. You can talk to them to learn more about that. Also the game is rogue-like, if you and everyone else in your group dies you have to start over again with randomized people and randomized events linked to the locations.\n\nThe game could have some RPG elements where you can either individually level up you and your members or let the game decide how many people should level up towards pistols, machine guns, heavy weapons, melee or medic. The game shows how many people are focused on each class.\n\nOf course the AI will have to be pretty decent and you should be able to bark orders at them, maybe be able to divide your group in squads."
5bvwsx,A Civilization-style strategy game of which players play as militant religious factions in the Middle-East.,
5bs9z0,I would like an all-player MMO sandbox space game with optional programming elements.,"Think of something like ""agar . io,"" but the circles are not circles, they're planets and ships and space stuff... So, yeah, like in ""FTL,"" the ships have a variety of ship systems that need to be manned in different rooms... but unlike a regular game, you are one of the characters! \n\n...\n\nYour job isn't assigned by a special job system, it is assigned by a player! You can choose to do whatever you want. You can get out your phaser and shoot the captain (a player) and declare yourself captain or whatever! You could be a ""Space Engineer"" and weld ship parts together, and charge other players for the service, or you could be really rich and hire another player or players to build a ship for you, and be the captain, and have your friends be the crew, and even have your own room, with items you can push around, and a holodeck, and replicator, etc.\n\n...\n\nThen there's the deep quest mechanics, where someone hires people to mine for minerals, and there's a complex materials system with physically moving elements around in different pots and chambers and machines to create different elements, and you discover that you can make some awesome tech, but you will need more of a super rare element, but you can't go yourself, you have too many experiments you want to do, etc etc.\n\nOr you could be a super rich big game hunter and you want a better laser gun with a super rare element that you've heard is only found in sector 500 or whatever, on a distant planet, etc.\n\nSee, that way, you don't need NPC's or cookie cutter quests.\n\nAlso, astronomy seems to be quite popular, so I'm sure some players will gather together to research the stuff**** out of astronomy, and develop super advanced sensing technology that can tell you which planet has element X Y Z on it... eventually... \n\n...\n\nMaybe the game universe starts with everyone on a planet like earth, but totally wild and un-settled. You can build all sorts of stuff, with player submitted content and ideas that are carefully balanced and tweaked to fit into the game just right before being added. So, continuing from the previous section, everyone pursues their own interest area, so some people become scientists, some become hunters, some outlaws, some construction workers, some outlaws, some law keepers, etc. BUT the devs don't have to implement any of it! It's all mostly in your imagination!\n\n...\n\nEventually, people from various research interests get together and combine their blueprints to make some really complex components, but the people who have high constructing skills have to actually assemble it so it will be decent quality, so it would require a lot of cooperation between players.\n\n...\n\nExperience branching could work like this:\n\nWhen you perform an Action, you unlock a Research branch and a Skill branch, along with a bunch of EXP points.\n\nPutting EXP into the Research branch would increase your chances of getting Insights. An Insight is like an upgrade or extension to an Action. You can share Insights with others and even craft Blueprints with them.\n\nPutting EXP into the Skill branch increases your chance of getting a better Quality result. As you level up, you get less and less of an improvement. Insights for Actions may have Skill requirements from other Actions that you have to reach before you can use the Insight to level up a new Action.\n\nI don't want there to be actual social or status -related game skills, like ranks or even computer operating skills. I want those skills to be real player skills that players have to learn and master and obey and judge each other on. I also don't want to have everything be text input, that's soooooo lame. If your room is locked by a number pad, for goodness sake, show a number pad to click on. Imagine the trouble you could get up to by figuring out door access codes that way!\n\n...\n\nThen there's the sandbox. In the game, things would have various modular sizes. That way you could make modules that line up easily and snap them together or whatever. I'm thinking, what if the game had realistic sized stuff? What if an inter-galactic space ship had to be built thousands of squares big?? What if there was enough space for hundreds of players to play _just on the ship_ , and carry on their own little in-game livelihoods??? What if the game wasn't so much about space at all, but rather, it was about people figuring out how to work together to make awesome things happen?\n\n...\n\nI've seen stuff people have done in Minecraft. Some of those things were mind-blowing, impossible to imagine how they not only had time to do it, but how they could do something of the sheer magnitude that they did in the short amount of time that they did it. I'm sure that if someone made this game, players would make entire modular space stations, and have zoo's, and theme parks, and interplanetary battles, and cubes full of brainwashed cyborgs bent on total annihilation of alien worlds and stuff... and it could be mostly crowd sourced.\n\n...\n\nIf there are any important details that I left out, let me know."
5brvzx,Idea for a mobile game (Submitted by sixth graders),"I coach a Lego robotics team and for their Lego project they came up with a game idea and were looking for some feedback from game developers. we dont know any professional developers so please do spend a bit of time reading through below and provide us feedback if any!\n\n(Note: Below written by 5th and 6th graders)\n\nWhy did we develop a game?\nWe have made a game called Elephant Defenders. We made this game to make kids as well as others aware of the fact that ivory is causing elephants to be poached. \n\nWhy a game?\nWe thought of various ideas to spread awareness including videos. But after a lot of research and brainstorming and with a need to reach out to kids we decided that a game would be the best way to get the next generation interested in saving elephants.  We hope that Elephant Defenders will help kids be aware of what’s happening to elephants and why it’s happening. They will learn that buying ivory cause elephants to be killed due to the demand it creates. If we stop the demand for ivory, there will be no reason to control supply. Remember 96 elephants are killed EVERY day, and we have just 10 years to stop the extinction of these majestic creatures.\n\nBasic Structure of the game:\nOn the home screen, there is a big button which says PLAY with your progress through your habitat on top of it. \nHabitats are like arenas you have to reach with a certain amount of medals. Every time you play the game and win, you get 5 coins,5 points and 1 medal. Every 25 medals, you go onto the next habitat. There are 8 habitats. Every 70 points, you go to the next level. There are 12 levels. Every time you go up a level, your elephant's health increases and you get more troop points to strengthen your troops.  Whenever you win a game, you get a crate if you have the space to hold it. Crates give you gems, troop points, and coins. At the bottom of the home screen, there is 5 slots for 5 crates. You can only have one crate on unlock at a time. There are 5 different types of crates. They are wooden, silver, gold, rare, and extra rare. You can also buy rare crates with real money in the store.\n\nIdeas to make the game engaging:\nIn the store, you can use your gems to buy coins. Coins can help you get troop points for different troops. Coins also help you upgrade your troops. Gems can quickly finish the wait time for a crate to open. The store allows you to buy anything you need. All money spent will be given to help protect elephants.\n\nMessages in the game to spread awareness: \nWhen you press the play button to start playing the game, it will start looking for a computer opponent. While it's looking for an opponent, it will tell you a fact about elephants. When the game starts, it will ask you a question about the fact that it told you while it was searching for a computer opponent. There will be 4 choices to choose from. If you get it wrong, the finish line for the elephant will be further away. If you get it right, the game goes on normally. As soon as the game starts there will be a 3 second countdown, then the game begins. At the bottom of the screen there will be your gold bar from 1-20. On the right is where 5 of your cards will be. Each card has a different troop on it, with each card having a different value of gold depending on the type of troop it is. You can place your cards anywhere near the elephant and it will do whatever it is supposed to do. Whenever you place a card, a new card from your deck takes it's place. If you can successfully take your elephant to the other side without it dying, you win that game. After finish a game you get your prizes and then you are returned to the home screen.\n\n\nDo you think we are on to something with above ideas?\nDo you believe such a game structure will be compelling and engaging enough and will bring repeat players?\nFinally do you believe such a game format will be successful at spreading awareness?\n\nThank you so much for reading this far!\n"

5bps8e,A Game About a Politician on Hell.,"I've always had a few game ideas and while i followed a different path in life i've decided to give at least a try so i can finally bury my dreams. Enough of the pity me story heres a short pitch of probably the most attainable of the ideas for the complete beginner that i am.\n\nGenre:Visual Novel/Adventure/Whatever you want to call an Ace Attorney-like game\n\nYou start the game as a young, successful and incredibly corrupt and ideological bankrupt politician. You are the peak of your life, but shit happens, you die and go to hell. When you go to hell you are tortured for a few years until you're saved by some demon bigshot that heard you were a skilled politician during your life\n\nIt turns out Hell not only a incredibly beurocratic place but its also ruled by a senate made by the most powerful and influential hellspawn of the 9 circles of hell. These demons dispute against each other in battles of trickery and malice where everything is allowed as long as you're not caught.\n\nThis demon bigshot that rescued you has recently lost his position in the senate and wants you to enter said organization and uncover a conspiracy of the highest order that involves heaven, purgatory and hell.\n\nThe game is hopefully paced somewhat like Ace Attorney: Divided in Cases or Senate Meetings and those are divided in two game-modes: The Investigation/Research and the Meeting. First half of a case is you trying to get the maximum possible of information, connections and blackmail to get ready for the eventual meeting. The second half of the case is the meeting itself where you have to use that info in climatic filibusters to lie, cheat and steal your way into passing or stopping laws that might help/stop you in your objective to uncover the conspiracy\n\nWhile you do your stuff you will interact with a bunch of wacky characters that you expect from an Ace Attorney-based game that become your friends and political rivals. People that have gotten used to life in hell and people that don't. Demonic Politicians that have the most varied political beliefs. Even people that really shouldn't be in Hell. Can love bloom on the battlefield (of hell's political world).\n\nTL;DR: Go to hell, uncover a political conspiracy and maybe become a better person.\n\nI've written all this shit but my idea for the more important details are pretty barebones, but fuck it, i'll try at least to do it, so i can finally say ""i at least tried"".\n\nBut feel free to use my idea if anyone wants to use it though. Just give it a shoutout"
5bowpd,Phonosapiens,"So, there's a lot of kids my age who have phones, and I don't. Don't get me wrong, I'm not jealous, but it sparked an idea within me that phones have a lot of exploration. Maybe it would be a good idea for a game concept. Wait, what? There's a music group called the phonosapiens? I don't care. So, the idea is basically you travel to different (not all) capitals of the world (for example, London, Paris, Madrid, and I'm too lazy to Google any others) in the modern world, and you have to fight criminals that are commonly found there, and when you do, you take the money they have, and it transfers into your phone, getting you apps, which connects to your body and gets you powers. Now, one thing, I don't want it to be RPG-ish, I would prefer it being Mega Man-ish. Only because I feel like leveling up is an illusion of enhancing the game time, but in actuality, you aren't doing anything. I would love to know about any games similar to this, or any criticisms (positive or negative) that you have."
5borkd,Historical Warfare,This idea is not meant to be an indie game. I don't think anyone who looks at this site as a serious game developer would even consider it. I'm just wondering if this was a fully fledged game would you play it?\n      A game where you could join a server and you would play a random mode (In other parts of the game you could test) throughout history for example: A skirmish between rival Bedouin Tribes in Arabia in 561 A.D. Or maybe the ransacking of a Roman city in 12 A.D. From Ancient Warfare to Gunpowder Warfare there are hundreds of possibilities and combinations. You would have to train in each era to become a master of all of them. Let me know what you think! Thanks for reading.
5bmytl,The Ultimate Zombie Apocalypse Game,"- No set plot or quests. Instead, enough time and detail would enable  each player to truly have a unique experience. Basically, the game is all about survival!\n- Set across the USA. Each state would be a complete open-world in itself, with loading screens only occurring between state borders.\n- Build your group full of other lone survivors, families or groups. Or if being a typical wasteland hero doesn't float your boat, you will have to search for settlements, safe-towns, or even cannibal cults.\n- Complete customisation over you and your own family (you, husband/wife, and up to 3 children of any age). You will be able to play as each family member, by switching at any-time in game.\n- NPC's don't occur often (it's an apocalypse after all!) Each person has the ability to become hostile, or join you as a follower. You won't be able to tell if someone is hostile without first engaging in a conversation (as in the real world). Each NPC has their own unique backstory, and so may not initially reveal their true nature.\n- Story line entirely based on your own unique choices, which in turn, will shape and alter the opinions others have of you. Followers may not stay that way, if they disagree with the decisions you make along the way. \n- In order to reflect real life, you can only choose one playable character that will survive after each death. If you want your family and followers to survive you will have to build up your settlement with  a proper defence system, in addition to preventing fights and conflict from breaking out (you'r followers have their own unique back story which affects their personality and capability of coping with the stresses of apocalyptic life). Anyone living that dies, will become a zombie if damage to the brain is not inflicted after death. \n- Zombies, whilst not unique in terms of personality, do have collective habits when part of a hoard. They will react to loud noises, sight, and seasonal changes. Your settlement may be safe from zombies now, but any distraction has the capability of attracting mass hoards that you will need to build a strategy in order to defeat. \n- This should reflect real life as much as possible, with an ability to chose your game-play to reflect what you enjoy in a game. All NPC's have a life of their own; they aren't just a character with some preset answers and a basic role in your story. The level of interaction you give to each character, will enable you to unlock flashbacks of their life before the apocalypse. We're talking about The Walking Dead kind of community feel. Become a ruthless killer, a protector of your settlement, or simply find friends, enemies and even romance in a world filled with terror. \n"
5bkvop,[Abstract]Alternate Realities,"I was looking at Telltale games, not a huge fan of the games themselves but I like the idea behind them.\nI had an idea for a choice-driven game, similar to something by TTG except that after you make a choice, the screen splits into displays showing what would have happened if you chose something different. \n\nThe twist here is that what's shown on these ""alternate realities"" is not what actually would have happened, and instead just have your alternate, hypothetical decision somehow leading to your death."

5bg2m6,"Community-centered, text-based RP-Battle Arena","So... on 9gag I recently stumbled across a series of posts that reminded me of text based rpg's. \n\n-&gt;[check some of these out](http://9gag.com/u/thomaict) &lt;-\n\nI had a ton of fun going through these fights and, when there was more than one possible winning outcome, I almost always checked if I could find the other ones too. \nMy game idea is the following:\n\nWhat if there was a mobile game which essentially is just a data base of different sheets like the one on 9gag. You can select different maps and different creatures battle them with limited amount of lifes and if you win you gain some kind of score, which can be compared with other players. \n\nEach player gets to rate a sheets difficulty and the score you get from beating a certain sheet depends on its difficulty (it would be difficult to create an algorithm to determine a sheets difficulty since algorithms cannot take into account how complex a certain riddle is)\n\nAnd now comes the twist, the sheets are not only created by the devs but players can also submit their own sheets which get rated by difficulty and complexicity. This would allow a whole community of players to share and explore their fantasies about any fictional fights. (it doesn't have to be restricted to the fantasy genre, imagine fights like Batman vs Superman or Godzilla vs One Punch Man or Diablo vs Legolas) \n\nIf the game grows and more money is available the top rated fights could also be animated, but that wouldn't really be necessary. \n\nWhat do you guys think? Where are the problems? for me it seems like a doable project for someone with a little bit of experience in game making. \n"
5besj0,4 Player Split Screen First Person Shooter for PC,"There is a sever lack of 4 player split screen fps games on steam like Call of Duty. Having to buy an older console just to play COD with friends kinda sucks so it would be great if someone could do this. \nP.S. I know Screencheat is a game that does this however I meant a first person shooter in the more conventional sense, as I said before like COD."
575ns7,"Text based, turn based strategy with industrial politics.","This is basically inspired by the now virtually defunct [Wargames2.0](http://www.wargames2.net), and many similar games. It wouldn't surprise me if something similar to my proposal exists, but I'm not aware of it.\n\nIn these kinds of games, players play the role of nations, expending stored turns to explore land, build buildings, trade in resources and attack other nations. No maps, just text. Rounds last for a finite period, and the aim is to reach the top of the power table, or to get your chosen alliance to the top of the alliance table. \n\nWhat I thought would be cool is if players also had the option to play as private corporations or labour syndicates instead of nations. The number of active players playing nations would be limited; all other players would have to choose from one of the other two options. As a corporation or labour syndicate, you would operate within the territories of nation players, who could set their laws, style of government, and immigration policies accordingly. \n\nHowever, the core mechanic for corporations and labour syndicates would be similar to the nation mechanic. You could build buildings (in a specific country), buy and sell resources, buy or manufacture weapons, engage in sabotage, and even create private armies. As with nations, corporations or syndicates would form various types of ""federations"" (aka alliances) in order to cooperate with others.\n\nCorporations would initially expand via trade and manufacturing; syndicates would direct their workers into certain industries to earn wages, expand their membership and engage in industrial action. Corporations would be officially registered; syndicates could potentially operate under the radar. \n\nNations could choose whether or not to set up stock markets, and corporations could sell shares, both to other players or via AI mechanics. Hostile takeovers would be possible. Criminality such as smuggling and black market activities would be an option for syndicates. Both corporate trade federations and syndicate federations could launch insurrections against nation players, while synidicates could occupy workplaces, expropriate corporate property and ultimately forcibly take corporations over. \n\nThat's a basic sketch, so I'll stop there."

573zv9,A Band Simulator,"My idea is a band simulator, where you create a character (or characters), name your band, write songs, release albums/singles, sign onto a publisher, etc.  Yes, I've heard of Chart Wars 3 and played it quite a bit, it's pretty fun to play for an afternoon or so.  However, my idea is based more around a single band, rather than managing multiple bands.  Anyway, if I was only half good at coding and had the patience to learn I would do it myself, but with my current skills I just find myself stuck with a lot of ideas and no way to make them a real thing.  I'll keep you guys updated, recently I've been making some notes in a Word document, if I ever get it a bit more filled out I'll share it."
572zlo,Pokemon MMORPG - you play as a trainer but battle as a pokemon,"Hello everyone,\n\nsince this is my first post on reddit ever I apologize for any mistakes I have made :)\n\nSo lets get to the point of this idea. This is just the basic concept and I have no idea if there are similar ideas out there (prolly yes).\n\nGame would be like open world mmorpg where you play as a trainer (but with a camera positioned like in rts or moba games - lol or dota). You would be able to walk around do quests follow story/ies, interact with npcs, there would be cities (something like current pokemon games).\n\nBut the main difference would be battle system. It should be made like this: when you engage battle any form/shape of battlefield/arena would open (with different settings, like forest, ice, rock and so on...) and you would engage in a fight (could be done for 3vs3 or 2vs2 battles as well). The battle itself would play like mobas but where you have pokemons instead of champions and pokemon moves/attacks instead of spells/abilites. Some would require skill, some would be passive abilities... I hope you get my point. :D\n\nThese skills would be taught by trainer when traveling trough vast open world, there can be skill/ability tree for every pokemon, and some skills any pokemon can learn. There would be skills you can take right before battle (these would be pokemon/species specific or universal - could be used to balance battles or for certain battle comps in multiple trainer battles).\n\nSo thats it for now - this is my last night idea, and I had to write it down somewhere before its lost to the gates of oblivion. Anyway I appreciate all your inputs, be free to add something or if you can, CREATE IT! :D\n\nCya boyz and grills, enjoy your day!\n\ngg-ghost"

56y9x1,Medieval simulator.,"The game world is comprised of a castle and city surrounding the castle as well as some wilderness surrounding that. It will have all the typical places to visit in a medieval type setting: market, dungeon,  feasts, guard towers,  etc. Basically when the game starts you are assigned a random person,  this could be anyone from a prisoner stuck in prison,  to a peasant, to a guard, you could even be the Lord of the castle. You play as that person until you die and then are assigned another random person. What you do as each person can affect the world around you. As well if you get stuck as a useless person you can either spend your time trying to improve their life or trying to get the character killed in order to move on to someone better. Could be fun and create some interesting experiences. "
56y9pp,Footmen Frenzy Standalone.,"If any of you ever played WC3 and dabbled on Battle.Net you'll know where I'm going with this. \n\nFootmen Frenzy was/is a 3v3v3v3 custom game mode built using the wc3 map editor. It centres around each player having a barracks where units are spawned periodically that can be upgraded through the barracks. The win objective? Be the last team standing. Each player also chooses a hero from a large variety of heroes at the start of the game.\n\nNow, my idea is to build a standalone version of this game, similar to all the Dota clones that spawned over the recent years. With updated and new mechanics this could potentially be a big seller. Footmen Frenzy was almost as popular as DotA 1 was back in battle.nets heyday. \n\nA few ideas for heroes and mechanically changes I had were;\n\nFor mechanics you could change how a player chooses his units. This could be done similar to current Footmen Frenzy. Players start with a base unit that can be changed through upgrades at their main building. Or you could allow people to choose a specific race in their profile to start with and allow them to progress through that tech tree.\n\nFor Heroes there would be 3 types: Support, Defensive, and Offensive.\nSupports would buff their team while simultaneously debuffing the opposing team.\nDefensive heroes would be focused around killing large amounts of creeps quickly.\nOffensive heroes would be focused around targeting opposing teams heroes and killing them quickly.\n\nYou could add ranking/levelling systems etc to this and even potentially turn it into an eSports."

56wq5l,Asteroids-like Space Adventure,"Hi, I used to make my own games. I created several iterations of asteroids-like space shooter games. I can't develop games anymore due to some mental health issues, but here is a game idea I was working on before I became too sick to continue.\n\n...\n\nAlright, I hope that everybody knows what asteroids is. There are a few different versions of the game. Basically, it's an arcade game where you fly around in a ship and shoot big asteroids into smaller ones, until they are blasted to dust. Then the next level starts, with more and more until it's impossible... and aliens...\n\n...\n\n(not advertising my game, it will never be sold or played, just for historical reference)\n\nI'm an enthusiast of all things random... well some things... and I enjoy things that can have seemingly infinite content, so I decided to sew those features into the game. I also wanted to remove the sense being totally lost, and having nothing to do, so I added a quest system and aliens and a briefing room and all of that. I used game maker (which is now game maker studio), but I didn't use their overly simplistic icon system... \n\nFirst, I created a test implementation of seamless map wrapping. This is when you fly through space and go off the edge of the map, and come out on the other side. This time, you have no idea you did that, and the finite and persistent area remains intact.\n\nNext, I implemented actual ship landing. You have to carefully and slowly glide up to an asteroid, match its velocity, and edge toward the center. Once you're there, your ship has landed. I wanted to make the game switch seamlessly from space to planetary map while zooming in on the planet for a more immersive experience, but I never got around to it.\n\n...\n\nINTRO: A massive group of comets, asteroids, and other stellar bodies, is headed directly for our solar system! Due to massive leaps in military remote viewing technology, our government is the only group that is currently aware of the incoming danger. Recent reports say that the incoming objects are collectively speeding up as they get closer! \n\nYou are a humble space cadet! Not our first choice for this mission, but alas, we fear that the great heroes that were sent before you have met some mysterious end. Yes, you heard it right, we're sending you in, with all of our nation's payload of nukes (only four due to disarmament treaties), to do as much damage as you can! Blast those space bits to dust! Or at least change their course so that they are no longer a threat to humanity...\n\n...\n\nAs a side note... I also made a little design for a nice little scalable-over-time semi-randomly generated town system with fully working infrastructure, etc. as a possible precursor to the space ship game.\n\n...\n\nSo, basically, you start out in your world's little low-tech (pitiful rocket tech that we have now, laughable) rocket, with some unfamiliar add-ons, like this mega-warp booster that shoots you across huge distances... Only problem is, you only have enough power for one mega-jump. The actual space heroes got the high tech ships... You are seen as a loser in the beginning of the game, and it is made clear that you probably won't make it back to become a hero. They just had an extra ship left over, would be a huge waste not to use it. Your briefing is done by a whiny general who thinks he's too good for this job and thinks you're a total moron.\n\n...\n\nYou go through the basics of how the ship operates, but you don't get to practice beforehand. It's pretty simple, and raw knowledge isn't going to do you much good anyways. Your ship has pitifully old fashioned mega-blasters that use ammo instead of power, and it has a very limited fuel tank for maneuvering thrusters. You'll have to scavenge some resources from the asteroids. Your ship can manufacture bullets and refine fuel from raw ingredients. At least you'll have plenty of food rations. Yummy.\n\n...\n\nSo you're finally off. Everyone's cheering, and there's a big countdown, and the general says some fatalistic remark about you being our last hope. A lot of funny space jokes pop up, like the rattling rockets, and a space monkey, and your cheeks flapping and teeth exposed from the high speeds, etc. Then the ship points itself toward the oncoming lethal space mass, and you disappear in a green laser flash. (fade to black, you black out)\n\n...\n\nHere is where the game really begins. You luckily have an onboard AI that is able to assess a lot of the situation and generate mini-missions for you. A beginner player will probably start flying around and shooting, wasting precious resources, so the AI will warn you that you have a long way to go and not to waste fuel. Your ship won't stop when you let up on the gas pedal, so your fuel should theoretically last you a really long time, if you use it wisely. In this first area, there aren't many comets or much of anything, just a lot of empty space and space clouds that you can absorb to refill your tank and ammo.\n\n...\n\nThe mission AI starts by scanning the area, and telling you that you need to plot a path toward the center of the cluster in order to plant your nukes. You get a (n orange) beam of light directing you to align in a certain direction and hit the thrusters. Yes, rotating your ship costs fuel points! As you speed up, the game seamlessly zooms you out into a larger field, so that you get a better idea of the massive size of the expanse. Of course, it's all a mix of randomization and video game trickery, but it's real enough. Gravity plays a part in the game, but most of the time you won't have any gravitational effects to worry about.\n\n...\n\nYou get to a thick looking cluster of debris on the zoomed-out map, and the AI decides that it is a perfect location to place a nuke. As you get closer to the massive cluster, there is a greater and greater chance that you'll run into something, and the AI shows a danger meter that tells you your chance of sudden deadly impact... It's a real game mechanic, so you do get a chance of sudden death if you don't slow down.\n\n...\n\nOk, so here's a more complicated technical part. As you get further in to the higher density areas, you will find a lot larger asteroids. As you progress in the game, and get closer to the ultimate core, you will encounter larger and denser things like planets and stars and black holes. You won't want to put on the brakes and waste fuel when you slow down, so the game will have to draw some lines to help players get into a stable orbit around larger rocks. It sure was hard to do when I made my own simple spaceship in gravity sim, but maybe that's because I'm a noob...\n\n...\n\nAs expected, since you have no landing gear on your spacecraft, you WILL crash into the designated nuking target asteroid. Luckily, you survive by landing the craft as slowly as possible, until the AI says the landing should be survivable. Of course, sadly, the space monkey does not survive... You're stranded with no way off the 'planet' with only a small amount of food rations, the mobile AI core, and a pitiful little pistol in your backpack. Not to mention limited oxygen in your space suit. Oh.... did I forget to mention that you set the nukes to go off in 24 hours?\n\n...\n\nI prefer open world systems, so I'm going to say the player should be free to await his/her inevitable death in whatever way he/she chooses. I'd wander around the huge space rock and poke around scanning things and generally exploring. If you go exploring, you will eventually (within 5 minutes) stumble upon an alien, or an alien spacecraft. If you decide to sit and wait, you will be occupied by some dialog with the AI, and maybe a spaceman will walk along and discover you and take you back to its ship, or maybe it will be flying along and beam you up. I was thinking of making a little stealth system, so that you can choose to fight or get captured, however you prefer. If you get shot, you will just black out and wake up in a prison cell on the ship. If you kill an alien, you may use the AI to analyze its gear and its laser gun and follow the tracking beacon back to its ship.\n\n...\n\nAny way you play it, you will eventually be in control of a small alien shuttle with minimal capabilities. Luckily, your alien friends breathe a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen, like you, so all you have to do is  tweak the life support system a little bit to get the ratio right, and you essentially have unlimited breathable air. \n\n...\n\nFrom here on out, you play the game a lot like an asteroids arcade game. You can stop the detonation cycle and take the four nukes, or leave one going (which starts a run-like-hell quest, which ends in a very scenic and satisfying space explosion cut-scene). You can use the lasers on the alien ship to blast little asteroids. You can go exploring the infinite void, although the direction you go matters, and if you go too far out, you'll find nothing, too far in and the aliens will be all over you. You could explore a bit in search for some alien explosives, and find a better ship to requisition...\n\n...\n\nIn this game, size does matter. If an asteroid is too big, your ship can't destroy it. It will just fragment into smaller dangerous space rocks. If the alien ship is too large, your ship won't be able to get through its shields, you'll be repelled or atomized. Bigger ships have more batteries, and so, can support bigger guns and thrusters. You may also learn to turn off your ship's locator beacon, then the giant alien ship won't be able to detect you because your ship is too small. The size of your ship affects maximum and minimum zoom levels.\n\n...\n\nSooo.... in conclusion.... yeah.\n\nYou'll eventually get in contact with Earth again.\n\nYou'll discover what happened to the previous space heroes.\n\nMaybe you can reason with these alien life forms.\n\nOh yeah, you'll constantly be kept thinking you're going to die for sure.\n\nThere's a finite amount of time to destroy or redirect the asteroid field. There's always a chance that you'll be too slow and not destroy enough asteroids, and you'll have to stage one last stand to protect Earth. There's also a chance that Earth will be destroyed, and you have to defend the survivors from asteroids and aliens as they set up colonies and defenses. But who knows? You could destroy all of the aliens and asteroids, or send them packing... or create an alliance?"
56o1jj,"A survival/open world game similar to Resident Evil 3, only the 'Nemesis' actually chases the player around an open map instead of being an scripted event.","Map is randomly generated, but always an island, about the size of... let's say Los Santos. Leaving the island is how you win.\n\nWhen I say 'island' I don't mean just trees and stuff. Some areas are city ruins as well. They can be randomly generated in the same way XCOM 2 does it, by shuffling chunks of buildings around.\n\nNot-Nemesis will not know the specific point the player is in, but they will always know the general area. It will randomly enter buildings around the area the player is in, and if the player takes too long to run, it will get the player's scent and sniff him down.\n\nNot-Nemesis can be delayed, either by the player dealing enough damage to it or setting traps, or similar stuff, but it can never be fully stopped before the end of the game.\n\nThe player still has to eat and sleep. Sleeping will still advance Not-Nemesis pursuit as appropriate.\n\nIn addition to the Not-Nemesis, there are still normal everyday enemies to deal with.\n\nItems are not particularly rare, bar a few exceptions (powerful weapons, for example), but the player has a limited inventory slot, so they have to choose what to grab.\n\nTo be able to leave the island, the player has to either find an underground tunnel, a radio to call for backup, a working boat, or a helicopter. One of these objectives will be selected at random at the start of the game, and be placed in an appropriate area, and the player will not be told which he has to look for. Maybe he's in the city looking for a radio when he should be at the beach looking for a boat. Who knows."
56nsrh,(Sorta) Realistic VR Tank Crew game.,"Since walking around in VR is a bit weird, I was thinking it would be cool to have a game where you and a few other people act as tank crews. You've got gunners, drivers, etc. who all have to communicate and do their roles to take down enemy tanks. There would be WWII and Modern era, with WWII allowing Sherman vs Panzer IV, and Modern allowing M1A2 vs T90. The tank damage, armor, etc. should be fairly similar, but the inner workings would vary so each tank feels different to use and requires players to know their way around the tanks to be really effective. The damage system should be similar to games like War Thunder in that tracks, ammo, engine, crew, etc. can be damaged or destroyed completely and repaired to some extent.\n\nNote: This is my first post here, so sorry if this isn't laid out well. I might sort things better if need be."

It was a game for mobilephones.\n\nI was very fascinated about the game and thought that it can be realized. I am looking now for game developers, who looks also for very extraordinary game ideas.

56kr4d,An RPG where you control the soundtrack,"This idea is pretty straightforward. You play an RPG character who, like Dragon Age's Grey Warden and Inquisitor, KOTOR II's Exile, and Skyrim's Dragonborn, has a unique ability: they can sense the ambient background music of the world and manipulate it. Abilities could range from intimidating shopkeepers by triggering combat music to buffing allies with the appropriate hero track.\n\nThe player would assemble a team of possible allies, each based on the personality of a musical instrument. The closer the player gets to these allies the more their songs will harmonize, unlocking group maneuvers and dialogue options. The many cities of the game would be themed towards different music genres, causing allies to act differently to NPCs and each other. Perhaps the drum-based barbarian can fit it almost anywhere except the Victorian high life and the high brow violinist finds a home in the boonies. And of course these characters would talk like Charlie Brown's teacher using their respective instrument.\n\nThe villains would be Noise and Silence, representing chaos and death, respectively. That's all I've got. This idea just seems like the perfect progression to the continued use of audio clues to guide players in video games."

56jbvi,Stuck In The DogHouse,"In Doghouse, you play as Jack. You are a simple young teenager, a boy with, what your parents believe, is a heart of gold. You move into a small town in England, a small home. You feel slightly out of place as an American, you are simply a fish out of water. Everyone is different from you. Though, some are more different than others. Some are dangerous. \n\nThe town is simply a small rural town. It seems to be on the peak of a boom, a boom that never comes. Half of the town is made of grim concrete, new buildings and flats. The other half is made of Victorian towns, old parks, farms and farmland, and forests. There was a clear split. On a certain road, it went from modern grimey housing to a rocky hill to a paved road out into the farmlands. The farmlands are made up of cornfields, fields of barley, some for farm animals; cows and horses mostly. The town is so small, there is no fastfood place within it, there is simply antique shops and some odd shops; model shops, hobby shops, cafes, comic shops, and other things. The 21st century would seem out of place in this town and, most of the time, it does.\n\nAlthough, during the day, the lands seem cheery. At night, the town is basked in darkness. Only the sparesly placed streetlambs and secruity lambs lit up the road. People were basked in shadows until they were almost a metre away, headlights would completely light up the surrounding area. This would leave anyone feeling exposed as they were lit up instantly, changing from light to dark in almost an instant. The small town had a different face at night. \n\nJack, being a boy in the 21st century, has a smartphone and a laptop. He can access videos, social media, research and look things up, as any normal teenage boy can. Through social media, Jack finds out more about the town, hearing the confessions that people display publicly on their accounts. Jack finds out more, from newspapers posted online, news articles, and the internet myths surrounding his town. However, Jack has to gain “friends” to learn about the town. Jack, having moved into his house on the weekend, has to wait until he goes to school on Monday. \n\nThe Saturday and Sunday are, simply, passed by. Showing them unpacking, revealing some of their character traits, until it flashes to Monday. Jack looking at himself in the mirror while he slips his uniform on. A blazer, a tie, a shirt, black shoes and trousers. A very formal uniform, even for a public school. He puts his phone into his pocket and goes to school.\n\nJack can quickly make friends on Monday. Yet, it is quickly revealed that his friends are not what they seem. From their conversations that they briefely share, they seem normal enough. Yet, if Jack does some digging on their social media instead of doing homework or playing videogames, he can find out what his friends have been doing. Some are normal from shoplifting, to animal abuse. Yet, from the likes on these posts, it seems as if these are popular ideas. Eventually, Jack doesn’t feel safe. He feels as if the town has gone crazy.\n\nThis theory continues to gain evidence when the girls start showing up at his house. They invited him to come out, go to parties and other teenage things. Sometimes, when they go out, Jack can catch conversations between the girls, talking about what they’ve done. If he gets caught, Jack is in some deep trouble.\n\nJack is in the Doghouse.\n"

Be in mind that you would have to create you own character  like elder scrolls, if you are having trouble thinking of how to create your clan look at similar games, far cry, assassin's creed and of course meddle earth, these games have one thing in common they all make something of a clan, village, team or a cult , I'm just wondering if someone can make a game that brings all this together, that you can fight along side your team against a enamy that is allso fighting with his team, make them stronger,bigger and smarter, to prove that you are the strongest leader.\n\nJust think about it. \nNaughty dog or a big company like them would benefit from this."

56ebkf,"Star Fighters: An action-RPG mix between Skyrim/Fallout, and Star Wars.","The idea is a game kinda like Skyrim/Fallout and Star Wars, where you have a galaxy, a ship, and about say 7 planets you can explore, all about the same size as the map in Skyrim, played from a first-person perspective, it could be made by Bethesda, (Mods on console!) or Obsidian, and have a force-like element, or a copy of the magic from The TES games, and a lightsaber like weapon too, it could be gray morality like Skyrim, or have a karma meter like Fallout 3/NV. (Yes, I'm aware of KOTOR.)\n\nEdit: Found out there's a space ship in Star Wars, a band, and a film, all called Star Fighters, the commenters can suggest a new name.\n\nEdit 2: The ability to have more then one race like in TES, I never understood why the main character in KOTOR couldn't be a Twi'lek, or Duro, I understand some other stuff like Wookiees though.\n\nEdit 3: Certainly no voiced protagonist!"
56e7xr,2D Action Platformer with psychokinetic abilities,"This is a fairly simple idea, but I don't know what flair to put this under.\n\nFirstly, the playable character has psychokinetic abilities but with a twist. While they have the ability to lift and through items such as boxes, small explosives, and other small objects, they can also create weapons and other utilities with their mind. They start out with something similar to brass knuckles, but with each boss they beat they gain an ability, such as wings for gliding when defeating an avian themed boss, an adhesive slime for wall jumping from a frog themed boss, tentacle-like appendages for swinging from pole to pole from an octopus themed boss, weak pistol-like shots for attacks and hitting buttons from out of normal reach from a western cactus-themed boss, etc. The player would use their abilities in quick succession to get across the level and find secrets. To access your abilities to have to activate a weapon wheel of sorts, causing time to slow down in the game. The slowdown gives you enough time to quickly figure out what abilities you need and equip it. The only ability you do not have to equip is wall-jumping. The bosses are far and few between in the game, and also challenging but fair. This is to balance out the fact that we get new abilities when you defeat a boss. In between levels you are sent to a small condensed hub-world. There you can buy items at the shop, talk to guards and civilians, and (of course) go to the next level. In the hub world, your character will be in their regular everyday form, but when you enter a mission you will see a short in-game animation of the character using their psychokinetic ability to transform into their battle form (think of the transformations of Aeolus, Atlas, Thetis, and Siarnaq from Megaman ZX Advent).\n\nThe story is about a young man (the name is a work in progress) who has had psychokinetic powers all his life. At the beginning of the game, he finds out that he is actual a mostly synthetic being created by the main antagonist when said antagonist set siege on the country when the protagonist is, and commanded the main character to work with him in his goal of having ultimate power. The main character obviously refuses. The antagonist goes into hiding. The bulk of the story is mostly of the protagonist working together with some rebels and what is left of the government to hunt down the main antagonist's underlings to find out where the big bad went. The main character beats evil in the end but suddenly goes missing. The story in the bulk of the game is up to the developer.\n\nThis section is going to be filled with ifs. If this idea is made into a game, and if it is successful enough to yield a sequel, I do have one suggestion. I'd rather the second game the playable character is different from the first game, with a different ability then psychokinesis. This would be a good way for the player to try and figure out what happened to the first playable character."

569ci2,Dragon Sim RPG/Strategy,"This has been my dream game for awhile, and I'm sure EVERYBODY wants more games where you can play as a dragon.  The basic concept goes something like this; you start out as a dragon about the size of a horse (maybe smaller) in an open world, high fantasy setting. The game is 3rd person. Your dragon is highly customizable, as you can pick a ""race"" at the start of the game; think of them as a Wyvern (""mage"" class), Dragon (""tank"" class) and Serpentine (can't think of a name; ""speed/stealth"" class).\n\nOn top of that, you choose what element you are (ice dragon, forest dragon, fire dragon, etc). Each element comes with unique appearance options, plus the typical weaknesses/resistances. As you progress through the game, you'll gain access to more and more appearance options (different wings, fins, horns, textures).\n\nAs for the goal of the game, you are basically just trying to conquer 5 kingdoms. In each kingdom you have to gain control of most strongholds before you can storm the kingdom's capital. Once you gain control of strongholds, you also gain control of their unique troops and supplies. This means that each kingdom you'll have to approach taking the capital in different ways. You basically plan the attack and assist your new troops in taking the capital.\n\nAs you level up, you will physically get bigger and statistically stronger. With each kingdom comes more and more formidable opponents, so you'll have to make sure you level up and make use of new spells (basically increasing the power of your elemental attack) and abilities. However, you will never get strong enough to take capitals by yourself (staying away from God-like power is probably best). In fact you'll probably get embarrassed if you try. Obviously each town you are attacking will have a fair amount of powerful mages, archers with elemental arrows, and heavy duty defense weapons to keep you in check. \n\nPlus the flying mechanism uses stamina, so you have to be grounded sometimes. You can't just stay in the air raining down fire the entire time. (The exception is the serpentine class, which uses far less stamina and relies mostly on surprise attack and quickness in battle.) The Wyvern (mage) class can also fly in place in order to cast ranged attacks at no cost to stamina. The Dragon (tank) is limited with flying due to high stamina use, but can still fly short distances and use flying charge attacks.\n\nAdd in some RPG elements (gathering lore, eating animals for energy, and learning new spells) and you basically have my dream game. \n\nExperienced or AAA depending on how detailed the world is basically.

568sb1,Driving game set in a bouncy and wobbly world,"It's a driving game, except the world is bouncy and wobbly. As you drive around, the ground constantly ripples and moves, and you also bounce off of it if you catch some air off of a ramp, or even off a ground wave if one rolls towards you.\n\nThere could be several game modes. Sandbox just has you driving around and having fun/experimenting with the bounciness. Race mode has you competing with opponents to finish a track first. Time trial would have you trying to complete a track in the fastest time.\n\nAny thoughts?"

5ej8xx,Raid Designer,"Been bored at work and came up with an idea to tide me over until I can get home and play WoW.\n\nRaid Builder. Build a raid boss, send your own crew out to defeat other bosses.\n\nSo the game is mainly focused around two aspects. 1) Desigining a raid boss, including mechanics and appearance and 2) Acquiring a decent team to take on the raid bosses of other players.\n\nWhen you start you will have a set currency you can spend on a limited amount of things for your boss. You design the appearance, his moves, and how an ideal raid group would come in and take it down. Once he's finished you send him out for other players to try and defeat. \n\nThen you create your own raid group from a selection of different character types, and give them a brief guide to how they will act when they take on their first boss.\n\nYour first boss will have 6 hearts. Any time your boss is defeated by a raid team you loose half a heart. When the hearts reach 0, it's game over for that boss and you have to make a new one.\n\nSend out your own team though and if they beat a raid boss, they get more currency and more unlocks. Your team will have three tick boxes. Everytime you beat a raid box you get a tick. Reach three and you get to unlock another raid boss to make, this goes on until you have a maximum of 13 raid bosses. \n\nIt's a very quick design for a game but I thought I'd share it with you just to see what you think. :) "
5ei3lp,The Most Dangerous Game,"A game based off of the short story, ""The Most Dangerous Game"". Two players, connected via internet, are spawned on an island. One is the hunter, which spawns in a mansion in the center of the island. The mansion is stocked with food, ammo, and the hunter also gets a light pistol. The other is the hunted, which spawns somewhere else on the island. The hunted gets a bag of food and a knife. The goal of the hunter is to kill the hunted, and the goal of the hunted is to survive for 3 ingame days. Wherever the hunted goes, he leaves a trail and snaps sticks, allowing the hunter to track him The players can also move the terrain to set up traps for each other."
5ei2bl,"Post-apocalyptic, deserted island survival game.","Back in high school, I wrote a short story for my creative writing class about a group of people stranded on a deserted island following a plane crash. Shortly afterwards, they learn via a satellite radio that rescue isn't coming because World War III has broken out, hundreds of nuclear missiles are flying towards their targets, and total annihilation is imminent. After discovering and reading it while looking through some ancient documents I had, I thought that this could make a great game.\n\n\nThe game would be for all current gen consoles and PC.\n\n\nThere would be online multiplayer and single player, the latter being more difficult.\n\n\nThere really is no objective except to survive on the island for as long as possible (build shelters, hunt, make weapons and supplies, fish, etc.), though I wouldn't disagree with a storyline mode.\n\n\nThere can be up to ten survivors and you play one while the others (should you have others) would either be other players or AI bots. You can either customize your character's name and appearance (or all ten survivors if you choose single player) or have them randomized. Each character has around 5-6 traits (always randomized) which give them advantages or flaws.\n\n\nIn single player mode, you, in addition to keeping your survivor fed and well-hydrated, also have to keep morale up for the others, as they're gonna be here forever and their loved ones have perished in the nuclear holocaust. If anyone's morale drops too low, they'll become depressed, which impedes them and also runs the risk of them committing suicide. Characters can get sick or injured and death is permanent.\n\n\nAdditionally, you have to be careful about food and water, as some fruits could be poisonous, the same applying to fish, and the water supply could be unsafe to drink without boiling first. There's also the possibility of survivors being bitten by spiders and snakes if not careful. Sharks can also attack survivors who are swimming in the ocean and shark attacks are not easy to recover from.\n\n\nThe game is endless and the characters will age. Not sure if romantic relationships, pregnancies, children, etc. would be a good idea, but I would think so. Makes it more realistic, plus it keeps the game going.\n\n\nThere would be a weather system, a day/night cycle and the island would be subject to some natural disasters. Earthquakes would be the most frequent, though they tend to be rather small and do little damage, though there is the possibility of medium-to-large quakes that can cause severe destruction, but those, especially large ones, would be rare. The island can also be hit by hurricanes and tsunamis, both of which can cause widespread devastation and kill survivors. Thankfully, those two disasters would be the rarest.\n\nWhat does everyone think?"
5efyzx,The Lizard Game,"The lizard game is a fun 3rd person, 2 player co-op experience.

Use head tracking, controller, time and heart rate monitor to trigger animation cues.\n\nAn example would be; your riding in the back seat of a car with two people in the front. You turn your head to look at some beautiful scenery, while you turned your head was turned the people disappear one per head turn and the car starts uncontrollably heading towards a building. You reach for the door handle, it pulls off and disintegrates. As your heart rate picks up the vehicle appears to move quicker. You hit the building, as the vehicle goes through the wall the debris and car vanish as you transition into a new scene.\n\nUse camera tracked heart rate monitor or controller based heart rate monitor to avoid cheating"
5ebytk,An RPG where players actively contribute to the game's artifacts,"Yet another Experienced/AAA idea, but nonetheless...\n\nIn most RPGs, you'll come across enchanted items with some story behind them. ""This sword was used by Lord Stickman at the Battle of Sticktopia, where he slew the Great Doodle and, in doing so, absorbed its powers into the blade. Now, the Doodler can draw any enemy you slay with it.""\n\nIn my never-ending quest to find more immersion in games, I ask: Why not have a game where the player can contribute to these artifacts, as opposed to only being able to find them?\n\nGenerally, players are limited to top-tier gear through either (1) finding scripted drops, or (2) going through a crafting-enchanting process (See: Elder Scrolls series). But, why not introduce a plethora of new ways to get insanely powerful gear? Here's some ideas:\n\n* Being victorious in a large battle, and/or slaying some unique foe\n* Gathering hundreds of souls and sacrificing them in some dark ritual\n* Ascending to an insanely high level of power, such that you are able to create artifacts\n\nThe game could either be an MMO, where these items persist in the same world for others to find, or more of a mostly single player Dark Souls-like experience, where these items can find their way between player worlds after their creation.\n\nThe main feeling I want to give to players is that of broadening the scope in which they can exist in the world. Most RPGs put you in the position of being limited to the confines of what the game has pre-rendered for you to find - I want to stretch those limits."
5eaocm,Multiplayer SimCity,"I just had this idea, thought I'd quickly share it.  It's a multiplayer co-op SimCity-style game.  Each player takes control of one aspect of the city, e.g. power, roads/rail, police/firebrigade, residential etc...  Each is given a budget and must spend it wisely."
5eadd4,Ideas for Tunneler remake,"Lately I've got into split screen gaming and as much it's fun it is rather hard to find games that we play for a longer time (that do not either have steep learning curve, technical issues, bad controls, mechanics that is too boring or combination of all these issues).\n\nI am looking into remaking the old DOS game [Tunneler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wcdIDr4jrU). I've found two remakes [Miner Wars Arena](http://store.steampowered.com/app/219070/) and [Tunnelers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZmQRCGzD_Q) that are similar to what I'd like to do.\n\nI remember that as a kid Tunneler was a great fun. Seeing that Miner Wars Arena does not have great reviews, what are the things that you think a similar game (digging + fighting) should have that would make it fun to play without getting boring fast?\n\nI definitely want to focus on local split screen multiplayer.\n\n"
5e9xup,A multiplayer roguelike,"I've had this idea for some time, a game where people form a party to take on pocedurally generated dungeons. It should have that aspect of roguelike, where you don't know what your items do at first. \n\nI also think there should be items that you can take with you on other dungeons with other characters, like rare drops from bosses.\n\n  It would be class based, but I think that having more skills than you can use in a run would be good for customisation.\n\n  I can imagine it being 2d with pixelated graphics. Also, maybe some pvp modes, but probably not.\n\n  I even had some ideas for classes and their kits, but nothing far from normal (warrior, mage, necromancer, etc).\n\n  Sorry if a similar idea has already been posted (but i did search for 'multiplayer roguelike') and for the english and formatting as well."
5e9sqq,A game about being a tree in the Rainforest.,"I thought of this game as I learned about the Wet Tropics of Australia.\n\nBasically, the main idea is that you are a small tree that just sprouted in the rain forest, and you have to control your way up towards the light. Whenever you are in the light, you grow 2x faster than normal, so your goal is to become the **tallest tree**.\n\nThe trees around you move at the same pace as you, and some have different abilities, like growing onto your tree and blocking your way, or preventing you from expanding outwards. "
5e9pvv,Mountain Climbing Survival,"You know, I was thinking of a game that involves a randomly generated mountain or mountains that increase in difficulty. It is highly encouraged to play with friends in case something horrible happens to you on the way up.\n\nThe goal of the game: Get to the submit and down alive. Just one of the team mates needs to survive to win.\n\nWhat would make it fun: You will get random events that happen while attempting to climb a mountain. The scale and severity of the events depends on the mountains difficulty.\n\nIts a game not about winning, its about the events: Winning and being a team player are central but it's mostly about the events along the way. It could be good weather one moment and terrible life threatening weather the next. You might all need to gather in one tent and wait for the storm to pass, unless the storm blows away your tent or an avalanche comes crashing down.\n\nI got inspired by hearing real mountain climbing stories. So what do you guys think?"
5e8pcf,[Need Ideas] Simple Games Based on One Mechanic,"    I'm looking to develop a simple games based around one mechanic.

I thought of something like a standalone source surfing game, but it's already taken. Any ideas would be appreciated "
5e85bw,Kinetic Typography,"The narrator talks and the words appear on the screen like on of those kinetic Typography videos.\n\nThe player must traverse this world.\n\nIn the first scene, I want the narrator to say;\n\n""You wake up in a room, you're anxious, you feel that something is going to happen.""\n\nThis makes up the four walls.\n\n""Now, he felt compelled to move, because at the end of this sentence, he would reach an untimely end because of a closing door.""\n\nThis is used to create the next platforms except for Door, which is used specifically to create that door mentioned, and have it slam shut right after. (We assume the player is smart enough to start moving.)\n\n""He made his way to the end of the level.""\n\nVarious platforms appear as it is spoken.\n\nImportant items and articles should be the word in the shape of what it is. For instance, if Alice was following a \nWhite Rabbit.\n\nIt would be a White font and the word Rabbit would be an actual rabbit who becomes a part of the game."
5e4mgx,Super Lucky Dice (From Golden Sun: The Lost Age),"Hey!\nSo when I was younger I was playing Golden Sun: The Lost Age for the Game Boy Advance. While I was playing it I came across a ""gambeling minigame"" in-game which I loved and played too f**king much. I've been looking around the internet for a similar type of game, but I can't seem to find a game that either looks or feels like that particular minigame. Therefor, I'm wondering if there is anyone who is willing to make a flash (.swf) version of this minigame with the same style and graphics. It is such a cool minigame and I'd love to see it as a flash game, if that's possible :) \n\nLink to the minigame:\nhttp://goldensun.wikia.com/wiki/Super_Lucky_Dice\n\n"
5e02m5,Base management game with exploration-dependent decision-making,"The game takes place in a country besieged by war.\n\nThere's a rebel base responsible for distributing supplies among the rebel side, and the player serves as the head of the base.\n\nIn addition to keeping track of supplies, employees and the like, the player faces the added pressure of ensuring that the base remains ""off the grid"" as much as possible.\n\nAlso, there are files and other pieces of information scattered around the base, and the player can explore and search for said information.\n\nWhile it's optional, exploration is strongly encouraged because, whenever the player is presented with a decision, the possible answers will be different depending on what and how much information the player had uncovered through exploration.\n\nNot only is it appropriately challenging, but it encourages the player to make decisions on the best and most amount of information possible."

5dzis6,"""Magic-centric"" video games","Why aren't there any better games for people who want to play mages?\n\nGames like TES (Morrowind specifically) were pretty good about allowing players to feel powerful and versital as wizards, who were actually worthy of being all powerful. You could collect powerful artifacts, kill off your rivals, have your own tower, make your own spells etc. But they still didn't really cater to mages.\nWhat great wizard actually gets to that point without doing extensive research into the arcane, or unraveling the mysteries of other planes? Why isn't that a part of any game?\nI'd love to see a game where you can do all this and more. Where rituals are complex and need a lot of preparation and careful calculation. Where, if you are clearly a mage well ahead of your peers, you are treated as such rather than talked down to by other wizards like you're some generic adventurer.\nSomething where you can attend mystical colleges or universities and actually learn and have better access to arcane based resources. \nI'd love to see a game where magic is potentially all powerful and capable of anything. And with a rich and magical history as well. Kingdoms built on magic, or destroyed by it's misuse with relics of their past still hidden in ancient ruins. \n\nAny thoughts or anyone want to expand on this, feel free to add."

5dxxse,2D Singleplayer physics-less game,"I know most idea creators come here after thinking of an idea, and usually have a very complicated MMORPG Open World idea; so I thought I could make an idea for a simple, beginner-developer - both SDK (Unity, etc.)  and Pure (Java, C#, etc.) - that help all the dev's here.  \n\nLet's go.\nSo the 'world' consists of an amount places; either planets (space), buildings (urban), castles (fantasy) or anything else - depending on the genre. The player plays the role of a merchant and can travel between those places (with a rocket, car, river).  \n\nThe 'currencies' are as follows:  \n\nReputation - makes people more eager to trade  \nResources - items to buy/sell/steal/trade/give  \nFuel / tax (or something like that) - the player need something to move planets / buildings / castles  \n\nAt one of those places, the player has some options which include:  \n * Stealing resources - reputation lowers and that specific place will never allow the player in again  \n * Trading / buying / selling resources - in dry places water sells well, in rich places luxurious items sell well (increases reputation)  \n * Giving resources away - the player has a limited inventory and this option increases the reputation, making this option worthwhile  \n * Traveling to somewhere else - costing fuel / tax  \n\nThe game could be 2D or even text.  \nIt could be as simple as select one of the four.  \n\nHope someone finds this interesting!

5dvh51,Dungeon Survival game,"**Name:**Dungeon Survivor\n\n**Concept Overview:**\n\nUltima Underworld / Minecraft with survival and crafting components, various skills increase with use\n\n**Plot:**\n\nVillage is attacked by evil bad guys and taken through portals to work in slave mines/ extensive cave system.  Character escapes through cutscene through an unguarded portal and winds up in random unused section of the cave system.  Meets up with friendly types who do the tutorial on how to grow, craft basic recipes, and survive.  Bad guys come, kill your new friends and you escape to another random cave.  Your goal is to become powerful enough to save your village and figure out what is going on, where you are, and get back home.\n\n**Setting:**\n\nMedieval type setting, at beginning of game choose a class: \nTown Guard- bonus to combat, mallus to farming, healing, \nFarmer’s Son- bonus to farming, mallus to combat, healing\nApprentice Healer- Bonus to healing, mallus to combat, farming\n\n\nThe player will start each section near a crystal portal that is currently unpowered.  It will slowly begin to regain energy and will then allow someone to come through it.  Takes about 30 minutes to 1 hour ( maybe changeable in settings) to recharge.  There are smaller charging crystals that will instantly open a crystal portal- bad guys carry these on wands. You steal one during your escape.  Your village friends and family are currently slaving away mining these crystals.  \n\n**Characters:**\n\nSingle player, first person- pick a class to start with some basic skills.  Will be able to level up all skills eventually. \n\n**Gameplay Mechanics:**\n\nHunger and thirst will be your constant companion, you’ll need to find food and water, recharge your crystal wand to open the next portal before the bad guys come through behind you.  You will find and/or craft armour, weapons, crafting tables, shelters, and defensive structures.  Each new cave, you’ll start almost from scratch- the portals you open can only let through a certain amount of weight per charge- do you gather a big charge and take all your gear with you, or do you just grab some food and jump through as soon as possible?  The bad guys can come through if you take too long- they will be a very tough fight but maybe you can get some nifty gear upgrades.  \n\n**Standout Features:**\n\nProcedural generated terrain or at least have several dozen different maps where puzzles (grow extra mushrooms to feed to large cave monster that has a stockpile of crystals he’ll trade you, sneak past a bad guy patrol, craft a booby trap).  Each cave should have a different goal to achieve to activate the next portal- or maybe different ways to get around obstacles. \n\n**Possible Platforms:**\nPC\n\n* Replace with platforms\n\n**Extra Features:**\n\n* Replace with extra stuff\n\n**How To Credit Me:**\n\nJust put me in the credits and keep me up on the details as you work with this will be all I’d need.

5dvaev,The Power OF PowerPoint,"I know, that this category is for ideas that don't usually become games, but I want to make this like a challenge that people can do, so if you want to do it, go for it, but I don't know how you'll send it, because I have no idea how. So, you know how there are triggers in PowerPoint that can be clicked on to do actions in the presentation? No? I'm just a ridiculous nerd? Oh. Anyway, I was thinking a game that has multiple options that effect the ending. I wasn't thinking like, 3 endings like, well, I don't like to say the name of it. But I do want around 10 endings. Maybe 9 and when you get all 9, you get the 10th. That's all I have, and this is getting pretty lengthy, so bye, and criticize this anyway you want."

5ds36m,Want to start a new game and want some help making it,"this will be an open world sand box player interactive game, and will require alot of teamwork and time\n\nFor the game, i am looking for around a group of 6-10 and will stay permanent (with the exception of increasing ) as the game developers, it will be a open world/sandbox with building capabilities like minecraft and rolbox, only more detailed, cool monsters/mobs and wicked animations, epic campaign (it will also have a creative/survival mode and have already been through the campain *levels*/challenges thought that could change if you got any better ideas). there is going to be one more mode but that is going to be a secret since is the only idea concept of any kind iv found. more to be told but i have a bit of a problem explaining things clearly without wandering to far away from the main idea.\n\ni am not really a programmer but am a graphic designer with basic knowledge in 3d modeling and animating and looking for programmers to join me. i already have a 3d modeler with me.\n\nand if u guys want me to post some of the ideas for the game and some entities that will be in or how the campaign will go just ask in the comments but like i said, i might start wandering off the real idea.\n\nand if someone wants to msg me in private, my email is : youcefthomas@hotmail.com\n\np.s. the game will most likely be using the unreal engine, and the people i would like to finish the group are \n2 more game programmers, \n1 more 3d designer, \na acapella music maker (plan to make the WHOLE game, the first game that is made completely with voices/a cappela and drums!), \nand like 2 artists that will help me make the textures for the world and things. \n\nthats about it"
5dm1e4,JOIN ME or just take my ideas...,"I read the rules and it should be fine to post this here but i would like to apologize to mods in advance if this is abusing rules. \n\nThis guy right here https://www.linkedin.com/in/israel-casillas-jr-80235751, that's me... hello.\n\n- Freelance web dev with focus on esports for past 5 years ( Frontend, Backend: LAMP )\n\n- Launched couple joint ventures recently that are reaching millions of users ( I work with several youtubers, and esports players, provided free tech/web help in exchange for client/friend helping grow my network ) \n\nDue to success of my current projects i will have a small steady income that exceeds my expenses over the course of the next couple of months and i plan to use it on side projects. No i will not be rich but it should be enough to bootstrap/kick start several projects that i have in mind ( 1 side project involves 2 games playable on - web, pc, mobile, and potentially console ). \n\nNothing revolutionary just a few games i wish i had available at my fingertips that would be insanely fun/popular and in all honesty i just miss. People may have listed here before, difference here is i have a large user base/network within esports and youtube industry that we will be able to promote through, several esports projects that now reach millions of users, a few large youtubers within my network that still owes me a few favors, and hopefully just enough money to bootstrap this into existence. \n\n- **Multiplayer MUGEN:** when i was around 13-14 i f%cking loved playing and creating different mods for this on my pc. Not sure of license, how difficult, or whether or not we could use but aside from core functionality another change i would make is an open marketplace of characters ( micro-transaction ) generated/created by ourselves, community and or random designers ( rev share ) sent to us to create proper move sets and inserted in game ( needs to be balanced ). \n\n- **FPS Gun Games:** A game mode i miss Black Ops 2 ""One In The Chamber"" with possibility of Black Ops II ""Gun Game"" - Search on Google\n\n- **Mario Kart Balloon Game:** A game mode similar to mario kart balloon game, 3 balloons attached, once hit balloon detaches/player loses a life.\n\nI have a lot of ideas/goals for both projects aside from whats listed above BUT our main focus would be MVP -&gt; market -&gt; scale ( obviously ). My end goal is to establish a subdivision of esportsplus ( my business ) that is dedicated/funded to primarily pump out games thought of internally and/or offer services to others. I would primarily like to work on our own games since i have a ton of others i would like to bootstrap/test or you may bring a few ideas so essentially small Indie Game Studio bootstrapping with a focus of small MVP's to throw and test with massive markets that i currently have access/marketing funnel to.\n\n**SO...** i have begun searching for freelance game devs/designers that would be interested in working on this. MUGEN game is my primary goal/focus so i would like to work on that first. If anyone is interested PM resume/experience/portfolio. While i obviously know most will only be interested in pay keep in mind i **do not** have Angel/VC funding, etc. i will have to work within my means but i intend to get back to and negotiate with anyone truly interested, If you are an industry freelance professional looking for work this may not be the best fit since my sole focus is bootstrapping as much as possible. I have some idea of what the cost would look like but i would be lying if i said i knew the exact cost/estimate. Honestly everything is in place for it to succeed ( available no cost marketing funnel to initial target demo - gamers ) as long as the game is fairly well built i wont have an issue growing it.\n\nAnyways thank you all for your time. I will try to answer all PM's and posts here as soon as i can. \n\n*Placing flair as intermediate since i do not know level of difficulty involved with either game, i know there are a lot of game dev toolkits now but i dont know limitations, etc.*"
5dl2wx,Futuristic 3D FreeRoam/Action MOBA,"New Game Design Concept.\n\nGenre / Info: Free Roam 3rd person action moba. Players log in to a free roam lobby after slecting all their info and characters look wep styles etc. In the lobby there are stations to set up matches for 1v1 rankings and create teams for 3v3 competitive. There will be stations to recruit for 3v3 competitive and simulation matches where you can spar without playing for rank points. There will be an area to show the current top ranked players for each rank D-S. The lobby system will allow you to choose to go against players of your rank or higher if you wish and to avoid random one sided 1v1 match ups like sniper vs fighter. Or An S rank playing against a D rank.\n\nTeams: 3 members per team. 3v3v3. 3 teams per match.\n\nThere will be multiple map types, city forest etc, with different weather effects, heavy rain, winds, \nthunder, snow etc.\n\nRoles: Fighter, Shooter, Sniper. \n\nWeapons: Each weapon for the roles.\n\nFighter: \n\n\nEnergy Daggers: able to change shape and extend forward 50ft at lightning speed and retract back instantly . \nfor quick speed attackers, low durability can break easily if used for blocking. \n\nEneru: more durable and balanced in striking power and speed. Can extend\nstrike range momentarily. Like an energy slash coming forward out of the sword. Able to block physical \nattacks much better than the daggers, but nowhere near as fast. \n\nDaichi: A heavy weapon, not very strong when attacking but can go into a shield\nmode with great defensive power to block bullets and physical attacks and can take quite the beating. Able to use a boost effect like shooting forward or into the air with great speed momentarily. \n\n\nShooter: \n\nShotgun, handgun, grenade launcher, SMG, assault rifel, Hound Bullets. (Energy bullets controlled\nby the users hand movments, very hard to learn how to use but able to do unqiue angle shots other\nweapons cant.\n\n\nSniper: \n\nCannon Sniper: slow but does insane damage, can destroy any terain and break any shield if the user\nhas enough power, can be dodged. \n\nLightning Sniper: a sniper that fires bullets at an insane speed, not very strong but fast\nenough to hit any moving target of any speed.\n\nP-Sniper: Balanced sniper, strong power and decent speed, not as fast as \nlightning sniper or as strong as cannon sniper. Has the best accuracy of the snipers.\n\n\nRole Specials:\n\nFighter: Energy Shield. The attacker can put up an energy shield infront of above or behind him at any time\nto block attacks and bullets. The shield size can be expanded or reduced to block different types of attacks.\nHas a set hp% that slowly regenerates overtime, able to activate and deactivate any time, 3sec CD after \ndeactivation.\n\n\nShooter: Lead Shot. zooms in to choose target body part, Able to fire a shot that immobilizes any body part it hits. Arms disable attack for 4 seconds head shot blinds for 3S legs 60% slow for 4S. Lead Shot is a 2MIN CD.\n\n\nSniper: Cloak. Prevents the sniper from being seen from all radar and target finding effects and abilities\nuntil he has been physically seen by an enemy. 3MIN CD once seen. \n\n\nPoints and Win Condition: Battles are held 3v3v3 (3 teams of 3). Each player that recieves a kill gains 1 point for their team. Kills can also be stolen, for example TEAM A, 1 has TEAM B 2 down to 1hp but TEAM C 1 comes behind and kills TEAM B 2 then TEAM C gets the point. Once you die you are out of the match for 1 minute. Each game is played in a B03 style system. Team with the highest points after the B03 wins. Each match will have a 30 minute time limit, after the time is up the game ends and the team with the highest points wins. First team to 50 points wins the game.\n\n\nObjectives: In the middle of the map is an elite monster, known as the keyholder. He holds the key to a treasure chest which contains of course, some sort of treasure. (can be decided later) However the keyholder is protected by a barrier that only lifts once 15 points from either team has been earned. Once the game starts the keyholder starts off asleep for the first 2 minutes and then awakens after. Killing the keyholder awards 5 points to the killing team. Claiming the treasure increases the rank you gain for winning by a small ammount. If your team takes the key holder but loses the game then the ranking points you lose from getting defeated is reduced by a fair amount. They Keyholder does not respawn so it is a very important objective. Keyholder will require at least\n2 people to fight it.\n\n\nMap: Each team member will spawn randomly through out the map, the map is planned to be on a massive scale similar to the size of a real city, forest etc. In order to fit in 3 teams of 3-4 spawning in randomly. There will be access to a map, each team can see their  team mates\non the map but not the enemies unless in vision of a team mate. This will allow teams to figure out how to rendovue. Scouting will be important and so will positioning, where will a team have their snipers go to get a good sight, where will the fighter and shooter go. If its all three fighters on a team in a snow map how will they play.\nSpawn points will be set around the map in specific areas to avoid two enemies spawning right infront of each other.\n \nIn matches the game is focused around positioning and strategy. Depending\non your teams spawn positions and team makeup will make you figure out who to send where, what parts of the map to get to, whether to focus on grouping up or send someone on a 1v1 mission. Maybe have the 2 fighters group up together while the sniper looks for a sniping position. Terrain is fully interactable, allowing you to set traps, destroy walls to block off paths or make your own. If you were in a map with 2 areas separated by a deep fast moving river with a bridge over it, you could destroy the bridge making it harder for teams to get across.   \n\nWeather effects are going to be important on how teams act. If its intense rain and visibility is reduced they might prioritize meeting up more instead of risk being caught in an unfavorable 1v1 or 1v2. Something like snow will really reduce the movement speed of players making it harder on fighters but\nbetter for snipers. So how will they react to each map/weather condition combination. So on and so forth.\n\n\nAbilities: There will be unique abilites each member can choose to take in, for example an explosion trap that can be set on anything like walls trees the ground etc. But this trap only has two charges, some\nabilities will be game breaking but only one use and require team strategy and timing.\nThere will be normal abilites that can be selected to be taken in like a pltform jump. You set one platform\nanywhere, in the air on the ground ontop the water, you can jump on it and it will take you whatever direction you set it to face, it has 4 charges and each charge takes 30 seconds to recharge. \n\n\nTeams: You can not join a team for the 3s ladder until you reach B rank, B rank teams only face B rank teams\nA rank teams only face A rank etc. Each team can have any combination of the roles on their roster. Each team \nmatch is 3 teams facing off against each other. The highest seed team gets to choose map and weather\nconditions to help give their team an advantage. A team can have a member any rank of 1 above or below them. So a B ranked team can have an A rank member but not an S rank and so on. Teams can have any combination of\nplayers on the roster. 3 fighter. 1 fighter 1 shooter 1 sniper, or 2 shooters 1 fighter etc.\n\n\nRankings. There are two different ranking systems. Your solo ranking, and them your TEAMS ranking. You obtain\na solo rank in 1v1 b05 fights. There will be a lobby system to avoid things like a sniper getting\nmatched against a fighter. Or an A rank getting matched against a C rank. Each player starts at 0 points\nand works his way up to S rank. Ranks work from D-S. You pick your opponents except for competitve/tournaments.\n\nThere will also be individual class role rankings. For example, Shark94 is at 3250 points, lets say this would make him the #25 Fighter in all of A rank. Then Josh23 is also a Fighter at 3300 points, so he is the #24 Fighter in A rank. \n\n\n\nSOLO 1V1 RANK SYSTEM:\n\nPoints: Points will work like this, each win/loss rate will be different in each rank.\n\nNormal ranking points are for your individual ranking like D rank C rank etc.\n\nClass ranking points are for your ranking in your specific class like what number attacker in the world you are. \n\nFor example an Fighter is Rank D #4092 Fighter in the world based on his class points. \n\nPoints Gained for each WIn/Loss per rank below: D rank being lowest rank S being highest.\n\nNormal Ranking Points:\nD RANK POINTS: WIN: 50 lOSS: 25\nC RANK POINTS: WIN: 50 loss: 45\nB RANK POINTS: WIN: 85 loss: 100\nA RANK POINTS: WIN: 150 loss: 170\nS RANK POINTS: WIN: 200 loss: 250\n\nClass Rank points:\nD VS Higher rank: WIN: 50 LOSS: 25 VS Lower rank: WIN: 40  LOSS: 40\nC VS Higher rank: WIN: 55 LOSS: 35 VS Lower rank: WIN: 50  LOSS: 60\nB VS Higher rank: WIN: 90 LOSS: 50 VS Lower rank: WIN: 70  LOSS: 85\nA VS Higher rank: WIN: 150 LOSS: 110 VS Lower rank: WIN: 100  LOSS: 125\nS VS Higher rank: WIN: 200 LOSS: 195 VS Lower rank: WIN: 160  LOSS: 190\n\nPoints Needed for Each rank in SOLO 1V1:\nD. 0-500\nC. 501-1200\nB. 1201 4000\nA. 4001-10000\nS. 10001+\n\nS ranks will be considered top of the top and so their point loss is the highest to hold them to a certain \nstandard of elite play.\n\n\n\n"

I thought of it while binge watching Spartacus season 1 on Netflix and came up with some cool ideas for how it might play but i don't want to waste time making a long complicated post if noone wants to hear about it. So if you would like to know more leave a comment or up-vote and if this gets a lot of attention i'll definitely come back a write an expanded post about it.\ni remain, Offiial_nic_cage"
558sd5,FTP Kart Racing Game,"Much like in the format of Crash Team Racing and Mario Kart that the basic principle is to come first against how ever many opponents on given map with item boxes along the way and performing drifts to give you boost and get around corners with speed and swag. You also win some cosmetics or whatever depending on place. Different set of maps of course aswell as possible game modes including battle kart modes yadayada.\n\nThe difference is this: Set of characters with different perk abilities you can swap out (examples: faster drifting, better control, better item pickups, whatever), aswell as different cars that each feature different acceleration, handling, drifting and whatever other gauges that may need to be added to further diversify each racer and their car. \n\nBeing a true content over profit type of person i'd like to see the unlockables being purely cosmetic leaving all the perk choices and car choices free to choose from and maybe unlockable through play time rather than money.\n\nI see plenty FPS, MOBAs, variety of MMOS even online fighters but not one about racing. It'd be great to see being a huge CTR fan.\n\npitch me some shit hombres!"

5570m0,Dog game idea...,"I. Story/Gameplay: The players play as dogs. When the game starts, the player has to choose a place to put its new pet(the controllable character): large city, medium/small city, countryside/farm, etc. If a city is chosen, the player can choose to place the pet into an apartment or a house. There could be an option to customize the human family which will ""own"" the pet: choose how many members there are, how do they look(think the Sims series) which might have some impact on the gameplay.\n---Players can choose a breed for their dog. Players could also choose if there are other dogs within that household and customize them as well. Other pets can be added(eg: cats, parrots, wildlife-for countryside locations).\n\nThe player fully controls the dog and its interactions with the environment. Dogs can bark, growl, fight other dogs or thieves, interact with other dogs(computer controlled, NPCs) or animals.\n----- The game is a kind of freeplay, where you do as you please, but there are a few rules/gameplay elemenents:\n1) Behavior:\n--- You should always find a balance between being extremely aggressive, and failing to protect your family. Be too aggressive, bite an attack everyone and everything, and the game will be over far too soon, as your dog will be taken away by the proper authorities.\n\nOn the other hand, if you're too soft, and you direct your dog to run away whenever someone comes over, your dog's reputation(see point 2) will suffer and your game will end, as your master will give you away, since you don't protect him or his property.\n\nYou should decide whether a bark or a growl will suffice to fend off possible intruders, or whether it's ok to fight against an enemy dog(who wants to hurt your family) or a group of thieves.\n\n2)Reputation: Is a key game element and it measures how you're seen by the community(city, other humans and dogs, etc.). This is a numerical score. The lower it is, the more calm your dog is perceived to be by others. If it's high, your dog is seen as dangerous and a real threat. Each instances have their own consequence:\na)A low score(calm): Since you're seen as cool, non-aggressive and playful, people tend to appreciate you more, your family gets more visitors, with which you can interact, they can bring other dogs or other dogs might come to you by themselves(in this game, you can make friends).\n\nThe downside is that, since nobody really fears you, your family will suffer multiple burglaries and attacks.\n\n2) A high score means you'll have less friends, less people will visit your house/family, and if it's 100%, you'll be isolated pretty quickly. Your master will take measures to confine you, so you'll play in a very small enclosure, possibly even on a chain. If you continue to be aggressive, it's game over. The good side is that very few people will dare try robbing your family and you can make an excellent guard dog.\n\n----This score is reflected in every action you take. Growl at a kid and the score goes up. Play with a stranger dog and your score will decrease.\n3)Fighting:\nThis isn't a gentle, Sims Pets like game. It involves hostility. You will have to fight other dogs, if they attack you. You can bite, growl and make moves to defend your life. You will have to confront people who want to rob your family.\n\nYou will bark, bite and do whatever it takes to make the thieves flee in terror. If you kill a human(including a thief), the consequences could be dire. So when fighting a human, control yourself and make sure to end the fight before it ends in tragedy.\n\n--- If you choose a countryside location, things get worse: There is a chance you'll be attacked by wolves. This will trigger a tough battle for survival.\n\nThis is where the score comes handy. If you managed to strike a balance between being too aggressive/too friendly, you'll get dog friends to help you.\n\nYou and your dog allies can fight the wolf pack, and make it flee back into the woods. Or you can intimidate them, if they're fewer than your ""crew"". Or just run for your life, let others handle the situation.\n4)Dog interactions:\n---You'll interact with other dogs and they will become friends or foes. An enemy dog will try doing harm to you or your family. You can never have too many friends, so try being cool and peaceful...\n(more as I get new ideas about this...)"
555mod,A game about Joker,"Like since all the superheroes have gotten a video game, what about they make a game about one of the most well known supervillans of all time? Like his beginning, to where he makes his first movie appearance in Tim burtons Batman. "
553ybz,Schinderlers list video game,Im not even being funny it could be  2D and black and white like the movie. Have it in the style of Virginia. Because recently indie games can be very emotional so why not make a idie game of shinderlers list.
553wlg,Magic The Gathering MOBA,"I've always liked the idea behind MTG, but card games aren't my favorite. I enjoy all the different creatures and spells, but especially the Planes walkers. So I was thinking that someone could make a MOBA like game, where you build a deck from cards you get from each actual MTG set, but instead of playing the card game you control a planeswalker and fight along with your other cards as if they were creeps. i would say to make the game fair, when you first start off the game everyone is given a booster box of each set and every box includes a guaranteed planeswalker you  use as your hero. Then you build your deck out of the commons, uncommon, rares, etc. that you get. I have so many ideas for a game like this, but no idea how to make a game or even get the idea to someone that could judge it, but there is no better place for a idea to be judged than Reddit."

552ya5,Concept for VR Game,"I was thinking about some of the games out for virtual reality when I came up with an idea thAt I thought was kind of neat. I'm not a developer, coding and whatnot flies right over my head, but I wanted to share the thought.\n\nThe basic premise would be that you are a dentist for mythical creatures like dragons and whatnot. It would be in the same vein of surgeon simulator with you doing things like removing swords and adventurers lodged in their teeth. The failstate would be some sort of pain indicator, and if it gets too high, you are eaten. \n\nIdeally it would be for the vive and involve the room scale, as you would be tromping around inside a giants moth, rooting out the bones of something he ate, etc.\n\nJust thought it would be neat, and wanted to share it somewhere. The concept is goofy of course, but I think that would be half the fun of it."
552jap,Mask,"The player has a mask that they can take on and off. Whatever you do when you have the mask on, people remember, and punish/reward you for whenever you have the mask, but that doens't effect you when you don't have the mask. Whetever you do without the mask has consequences as well, but only when you don't have the mask.\n\nI imagine a GTA type gameplay where you freeroam around a city, committing crimes and stuff, building up a reputation. However, you have two separate reputations: one with the mask, and one without the mask. This leads to unique gameplay where you put on the mask to do something and then take it off after to not face any repercussions."
551ez9,Mass media wars (game concept),"So I want to make a game (mass media wars). Here's the concept.\n\nYou are the main censor of either Russia or the USA. Whatever your country's president does, you have to sugarcoat it, and if you don't, your president's opposition wins and you're fired (meaning game's over).\n\nYou start with Earth's map (think of defcon or plague Inc at this point). And you start with 3 choices; each will provide some boost in relationships with some certain countries. Then, according to the overall country relationship increase, you get a point (1 per every 10% of the country's citizens that support you) and then you can spend those points on organizing a hacking, spying etc. on the opposite country to promote your agenda. Also, random events happen (you're still on the same earth map), where you also have to decide how to present it to the public, and according to your choice you get a certain amount of points in certain countries or lose some in others. The goal is to either make your opponent lose to opposition or take over all the countries on the planet influence-wise (think cold war) What do you think of the gameplay?\n\nIt may sound interesting, but would you actually buy such a game?\n\nAlso, in which year should the events take place? I could make it 2010 and make real events speak for themselves according to how it was all actually presented Or I could make it year 2018 and fantasize from there Or just make my own world and start from scratch (for example Russia wouldn't have Crimea) The game would also not contain any revelations, of course (like, who is the liar, who is the good and who is the bad, there's simply no way of knowing all the details) - I'd try to make it as neutral as I can, but I guess it would be fun to read stuff about other countries and their attitude towards USA/Russia (you'd have to, in order to efficiently think out strategies of getting the countries on your side) and just generally learn ways of how media manipulates people (or might manipulate, in some cases)\n\nAnyway, what do you think?"

I'd like to slay a dragon, run from a Acromantula and ride a griffin. A little like skyrim pheraps in the terms of choices. If i want to go to Hogwarts i do, if i want to do anything else i make the decission myself. It would be a  huge game and a lot of people would love it, simply by being HP fans. I'm not a huge fan of the franchise myself, but i do enjoy it. I just fell in love with the creatures after the movies and the Fantastic Beasts trailer. What do you guys think of the idea itself?\nI do believe this would require a AAA team or probaply just be a dream for now. "

54s5oq,Fighting game where you grow weaker every time you die.,"In this game I imagined. You play as a highly trained highly decorated military force. The state makes clones of the perfect soilders to fight their wars. Every now and then, these clones rebel against the state in order to stop the corrupted cloning system. In order to have the best chance of success, they send in their most powerful soilder. However, if this soilder fails and the rebellion falls, the people in control will make the clones weaker by adding negative abilities to the cloning system. This means that every time you loose, your next play through will be that much harder.\n\nThis is where you, the player comes in.\nEvery time the clones rebel, you play as the most powerful clone in the army and attempt to wipe out whoever is in control. *Havnt thought that far*. \n\nGameplay will work like a 2d version of a simplified bushido blade.\nAttack, dodge, block for about half a second then cooldown, and counter.\nMaybe combos but thats after the foundations have been built.\n\nThe characters you play as will vary in emotion depending on how many times you have lost.\n\nFrom confidence to anger, wisdom, hopeful, sadness, all the way to oppressed rage.\n\nI kinda want to add a story that the soilder discovers. Every rebellion doesnt happen back to back so this means that each rebellion will see different technology, different leaders, a different society. This could breed tons of rpg like story. Once again, this comes AFTER foundations are built.\n\nI will work on this game after I finish the game im making now. Just thought someone else might want to have a go at it aswell. :)\n\nI will awnser any questions you may have. :)\n\nEDIT : : Please scroll down the comments until you find my awnsers to *burk_no_sleeps* questions. They add a lot to the game."

54q15w,Gaslamp Fantasy MMORPG,"I didn't know the genre existed until I just googled it now to type this Idea. But I seem to enjoy Gaslamp Fantasy, I was thinking that I would really love an MMORPG that would incorporate vampires, werewolves, magicians, pirates, thiefs, wizards, priests, zombies, demons and any fairy tale gone wrong fantasy incorporated into this victorian era set world.\n\nI'm Thinking dungeons like horror mansions that would mess with your party with mazes, tricks and hidden doors etc etc. ( like in vampire masquerade ) or a Dracula's Castle setting. It can being really extended fantasy and would be cool if it had a very dark tone to it.\n\nI know world of darkness was in the making but I don't think it was entirely what I'm thinking of, but defntintly would have been nice to play."
54pcx4,Master of Orion meets No Man's Sky,"I posted about this the other day, but very late at night with too long a day and not enough caffeine, so it was rather incoherent. As such, this is take two of the same idea.\n\nI’m thinking about a Web based Empire Building MMO - so that it’s accessible on the go for anyone, but can be played with a better experience on a bigger screen - that is basically a Space Based 4X/Empire Building/Exploration game. Think Master of Orion crossed with No Man’s Sky.\n\nWhat I’m thinking of here is a large galaxy - Maybe as big as NMS, depending on feasibility - which everyone is playing in. New players start out with a single planet under their control in an unoccupied area of the galaxy, but relatively close to at least  one other real player. The start of the game will be about exploration - sending out ships to explore the current system and neighbouring systems. They also have the ability to harvest resources, and to develop research and new technology. \n\nEventually they will get to the point where they can build settler ships - initially slow ark style and getting better as they advance. This opens up the ability for them to start to spread their civilisation to other planets, and thus the empire building starts.\n\nThey will also be able to arm themselves, for defence and offence as needed. At some point they will be able to customise their ships as well, to best suit their civilisations needs and wants.\n\nThe whole time they are doing this, they are in a galaxy populated by other civilisations - PC and NPC, friendly and not. This will of course give competition for various things - resources, planets, etc. But, given the size of the galaxy, you can always just head off into the great unknown of you'd rather not deal with others.\n\nIt's a bit similar to other games out there, but not exactly. I think the empire building sets it apart from this like Eve or Elite, whereas the persistence and scale set it apart from MoO. "

54nos4,A multiple characters game,A game were you play 3 characters at once and the 3 characters all stick together and you have to find out who is the protagonist throughout the story. Like if you pick up a collectable or a peice of evidence and it would give you clues. It would have mini games and team work puzzles. Unique dialouge with the characters and flash back sequences hinting on who the protagonist might be.
54mzqo,Blind fighting game.,Basically I am getting intrigued by all the gamers who do blind speedruns. I think it would be an amazing feature if we started having a feature in fighting games where the screen would just be black and the players would have to rely on audio cues in the same manner that audio cues are used in Dark Souls 3. Of course the requirement for such a feature is that the audio is on point.

54l47x,Strategy &amp; Economy Management game,"Hi! I've been developing this idea with Unity3D on last months we are at a point that we need some ideas and, if it's possible, some help on developing it.\nThe idea:\nYou have the control of a company and you can create subsidiaries of it for each business you want to play but all in the same world/map. (Per example: You are like Alphabet inc (google mother company) and you have subsidiaries like google, health, x, etc)\nThe gameplay:\nAs a company you would start with only one small business (like a grocery store maybe, we want to do it elegible) and, after earning some money, you can build more business of the same type (small or big groceries per ex). When having much more money, you can build your headquarters and make your first business a subsidiary of the HQ company, when this is done, you can create more subsidiary companies to expand your empire into more business (you can build, per example, gas stations on this subsidiary).\nAnother idea is on map/world section. \nThe map/world:\nThe map/world would be a city, with its roads, houses, big buildings, parks, etc.\nIt would be divided into tiles (square parts) and tha small business would need 1 tile to build, the medium or big ones between 2 &amp; 4.\nWe've thought about being able to expand to other cities (we're thinking to ,maybe, making a wolrd generator to create each city) when having enough money but being able to only see 1 city at a time (probably possible to see real-time stats of the other citie's bussines).\nThe challenge:\nAt this point of reading you would be thinking: but if you build and earn money and build and earn money, it's always the same with no need of thinking, you're right. That's why we want to implement some other competitors (other companies controlled by AI) and a few factors that make your income per business variable (like the economic level of the population in each zone, the criminal activity including random events like a robbery or a fire, the quality of the products, etc)\nWhat am i asking for?\nI'm asking for some ideas, especially on how to do the AI and the traffic system (to put some ambient to the world and maybe see the delivery trucks going to deliver the stuff)\nThanks! \n\nPS: maybe I have to say we're 2 motivated teens and we, obviously, are not professionals with Unity3D or other engine out there."
54ktrk,Driving game where you must follow all the rules,"This is a semi-realistic driving game where the idea is not to break any driving rules.  You are given a destination and must reach it within a certain time limit, although the time limit isn't designed to be the main challenge.  I'm imagining either a top-down GTA 1-style graphics or a first-person 3D.  The kinds of rules would be things like (the driving rules in your country may differ to mine):-\n\n* Don't break the speed limit of the current road\n* Stop at zebra crossings if there's a pedestrian waiting\n* Don't enter a bus lane during certain times as defined on the signs\n* Don't run a red light\n* Obviously don't crash or run anyone over\n* Don't drive the wrong way down a one way street.\n* Don't stop in a yellow box junction\n* Always stop at a stop sign\n* Don't stop in a no-stop zone\n* And any other obscure real-life road rules that exist\n\nOther gameplay elements:-\n\n* You can look at the map, but this covers the main screen, so you should park first.\n* At the end of each level you get graded on your performance, including such factors as not blocking/delaying other motorists.\n\nEDIT: You also need to park the car at the destination."

54i9e3,The Monk,"This game follows the life of a single monk in a Buddhist monastery in Australia.\n\n1. You begin at the age of 26, having given up on the rat race that is modern life. You sell all your belongings, buy a plane ticket to the city where the monastery is located, and donate the rest to charity.\n\n2. When you arrive, you are greeted by senior monks who show you around and explain what your daily responsibilities will consist of. You give them all that remains of your belongings and they give you a brown robe and a pair of sandals. Your life as a monk has officially begun.\n\n3. You follow a strict schedule every day. Your many chores would be mini-games. Every time you go to sleep and wake up, 1 month passes.\n\n4. Meditation would be a crucial part of the game, since reaching Enlightenment before you die would be the ultimate goal. Meditation is defined as ""stilling one's mind"" so you would have to play a balancing type of mini-game to prevent your character from becoming distracted by random thoughts or external noises.\n\n5. The longer you are there, the higher ""rank"" you have in the monastery. Eventually you could reach Enlightenment and become the monastery's leader.\n\n6. 100 years of age is probably a realistic limit, so the game would be composed of a maximum of 888 ""days"" in game."

You now have to sit back and see how they evolve with politics or religions and cultures. See them make citys and see what they invent and i think you might get the idea at this point.\n\nYou as god can ofcourse have a impact, you can either take controle of a human and make him convince that god spoke to him and he will found a religion and do the same with others so they will make their own religion. You can also make natur disaster or might help the people.\n\nIm sorry if you guys dont get the picture, I do have a hard time explaining my vision!

5djada,A city simulator in which your city starts from a pre-desegnated period of time and transforms into modern day,"I love city skylines, but it always annoyed me how your towns never grow naturally, but always start in the suburbs. It would be neat to have a city sim where you start in, for example, Medieval times and have to grow your city accordingly. Cities like london and paris are good examples of modern cities adapting their infastructure to make  it more accesible. Or you can start during the 1800s and make a grid like city such as NYC.

As well as dealing with existential crisis about who you are and why you do what you do.\n\nThe gameplay: Mirrors Edge Parkour, you couldn't play in an open world game in a city without it. Gun play similar to Wolfenstein, with the combat and stealth all included, while still having the same method for when someone detects you, as seen in Far Cry and Dishonored. There's a few other stealth elements that go into play as well, such as holstering your gun to conceal yourself as a threat. The game uses a nemesis system similar Shadow of Mordor for following your leads. You can choose to kill someone and extract the information from their brain, interrogate them, or just use subtle clues to piece things together.\n\n\nThis is just a rough idea, but I basically want to make a shooter heavily inspired from Ghost in the Shell, and take a lot of those elements to make something entirely on it's own.\n"

5d8h7f,Multi/single player business simulation,"This is probably more of a re-imagining than a novel idea, as ""I think"" I played a game like this 20 or so years ago...  If anyone knows this game, please let me know :)\n\nThe essence of the game is this:\nThe game takes place on a grid.  A business is represented, initially, by a single block, and grows by adding blocks to it.  The more blocks the bigger and more successful the business.  If different business come into contact with each other there can be a takeover.  Stocks could also be bought on a stockmarket with dividends paid based on the size of the business.  Players can buy shares in each others business.  Perhaps some of the blocks change colour if a certain percentage of shares are bought."
5d7hku,CRPG with MOBA-Style characters,"With the release of Tyranny, I've been brought back to the world of the CRPG.  From Baldur's Gate to Dragon Age Origins to Pillars of Eternity, it honestly a genre I've always struggled to like.  They seem like the sort of games that should be right up my ally, but they never quite click.  I'm pretty sure it's the combat that turns me off.  Many of your characters do little more in combat but hack away at targets with auto-attacks, while spellcasters typically have a bewildering array of abilities, which vary in power from garbage to god-tier.  \n\n\nWhat you generally don't see though, is a character with a kit of abilities that are small and focused in their purpose.  Character synergy doesn't tend to extend much beyond the tank/dps/healer trinity (usually implemented differently from MMOs, but still present).  Crowd control abilities are usually of the drool-on-your-shoes-in-place variety.  In Tyranny in particular (but also others), the moves also have a delay before anything happens, making me crave that immediate feedback you get from most action games.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nThe pause-and-play style of CRPGs seems quite suited to the sort of multi-character combos that can be done in MOBAs, allowing the player to take all the time needed to line their enemies up right where they want them and blow them away.  Maybe it takes some of the “skill” out of skillshots, but since the player would be directing 4 or 5 characters rather than 1, it would hopefully still be engaging.\n\nI imagine the biggest challenge would be designing the enemy AI and the player abilities to work together nicely.  After all, most MOBA characters are designed to work in a PvP environment.  What would be the point of ranged characters with cool mobility moves, if the enemy simply sticks to the tank like glue and allows the player to just rain death on them?  I imagine an AI that prioritizes squishy or low health characters would work a lot better in this sort of game than a traditional aggro system, allowing the tanks to have more interesting moves to peel enemies off.  Otherwise it would risk being just another CRPG, but one limiting all the characters to 4 moves.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nSo what speaks to me about this idea the most?  I think it's mostly that I enjoy MOBAs.  I love the variety, and the sense of character that goes into each hero, the synergy of a well-picked team.  But I'm not a big fan of multiplayer games these days.  There's too much stress involved in it.  I don't enjoy losing, or letting others down, or just generally dealing with other players – it's just not a relaxing way to spend my time.  Replacing the parts I don't like about CRPGs with the parts I love about MOBAs just seems like a good fit to me.\n\nIt also goes without saying that this is a pretty decent sized project.  Even pretending that story writing isn't a thing (it being the main reason people play CRPGs), it seems to me that to make the limited number of moves interesting for very long, you would need to be able to mix and match between a number of different party compositions, and because there are so few, each of the character's moves should be satisfying to use (which usually involves the looks at least as much as the mechanics).  Characters and effects are quite time-consuming to design, even using simple graphics, and balance would be a beast to tackle.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nDefinitely too big of a project for a solo dev, but I may eventually try to rough out a basic prototype of it, and then abandon it in despair once it sinks in how much work would go into finishing it.  Sounds cool in theory though.  What do you think?"
5d3tqt,"[Abstract] FPS ""Sports Commentry""","So this is not really an idea but more of a feature in a MMOFPS type of games. If you ever played PES then you know there is a commentary guy like in real sports shows that remarks on players and trying to guess the diffrent tactics of either team.\nNow, take your widely known MMOFPS like CS:GO or Overwatch and add this procedural guy voice that comments on the match like on ESPN, for people who died and waiting for the match to end or just stream viewers."
5d3skk,Christmas Wonders - A funny approach to christmas gifts,"This came to my mind when I was thinking about what to buy for Christmas, and how I would get it.\n\n(This game's style is 2D, side scroller, pixelart &amp; simplicity.)\n\n(Small Cutscene) So, you just got your new job in the best country of the world (Uszachstekisban) : Santa Claus in a shopping mall. 4 hours into your job, a white limousine stops in front of you and the doors slowly open: It is the dictator, his wife, and their eight-year-old fat and spoiled brat. The kid want's some presents from you, but unfortunately you don't have any left. As the parents think of assassinating you, you quickly decide it would be best if you went into the mall and bought something for their youngster.\n\nAs the game starts, you have to fulfill every new idea and wish for this brat. He is constantly near you, and you don't have money to buy something, so you have to improvise. The kid gives you a new item to buy every five minutes, and you have to get it in this time span. While you distract the kid with all sorts of stuff, like a baloon animal or a gameboy game from the nearest arcade, you have time to rob a store or take a found credit card to pay for that Ball of Looty game the kid wants, all this while the bodyguards of the kid watch you.\n\nJust remember:\nIf you let the rich kid see you out of your costume, you get assassinated.\nIf you let the rich kid see a illegal action of yours, you get assassinated.\nIf you buy the rich kid something harmful (for example a gun), you get assassinated (try buying a water gun and painting it).\nIf the rich kid gets harmed in any way, you are made responsible and are assassinated (Sometimes, the bodyguards will jump in if the thread isn't coming from you).\nIf you don't fulfill a wish of the kid in five minutes, you get assassinated.\n\nSo, as the stuff gets harder and harder to buy and the wished harder and harder to fulfill, this game doesn't have an ending, but is instead score-based.\n\nTL;DR: You have to buy things for a rich dictator's son before the time runs out. The game is 2D, in pixel style and score-based."
5d2xmn,Royal Guild Of Baltia (RGB),"A normal guy finds himself attacked by our great enemy, who steals all colors. The normal guy finds himself in a monochrome world, where certain 'blocks' work and some don't because they're robbed of their color. Some examples of this are a water fall that doesn't exist so you can enter behind the water fall, a vine rope that doesn't exist or simply colored blocks that aren't there so you can't reach a higher place. (my first simple GameMaker tries consisted of a level with a red, green and blue exit. Each of the doors were only reachable and the others would be blocked when the corresponding colored switch was pulled).\n\nThrough the game the normal guy turning hero finds himself winning back colors, getting abilities corresponding to colors: \n\n* green = leaf, a whiplike vine to dmg enemies or reach the other side of a ravine, \n* red = fire, burn dmg and burn leafs, \n* yellow (RGB) = red + green = sand, stun enemies and grind gears to a halt, \n* purple = red + blue, crystal, light up the dark, blind enemies, etc.) and \n* later on getting the ability to turn colors on or off at will.\n\nThe world consists of multiple worlds: \n\n* jungle (green), \n* volcano (red), \n* desert (yellow, red+green)), \n* water (blue), \n* crystal (magenta, red + blue), \n* snow (white, red+green+blue), \n* sky (green+blue, cyan), \n* darkness (none, black)\n\nThe world's link to each other on a rubik's cube/dice sort of way. Kinda hard to explain: i have in my head a sort of map where, to compare with a die (where a side and the opposite side always add up to 7), the number 1 always connects to everything except 6, but all those sides (2,3,4,5) connect to 1 and 6. On that infinite plane (1 connects to among others 3 and 4, you go to 4, 4 connects to among others 1 and 6, you go to 6, which in turn connects to among others 4 and 3, there is always a way to the side, or up (sky) or down (darkness). Say you're in world 1, green, you can go west (red), east (blue), south (yellow), or north (magenta), but not to the other side of the die, world 6, to white. You can go up from every land, to world 7, the skyworld (which can also serve as a hub, where you can travel to all other lands). Once you have the ability to turn all colors on or off you'll be able to get to the inside of the die, the black world, world 8, where the final enemy resides. \n\nI originally thought of this as a 2D side scroller, like mario bros., but actually think this would be a really nice idea for a 3D adventure, a la Ocarina of Time, with every world consists of a temple.\n\nWith the multitude of powers/colors/abilities, there are a lot of puzzle elements possible for entering the temples, solving puzzles, etc., where for instance, the green temple requires you to find the mid-boss to switch the color on, so you can find the weapon, the vinewhip, so you can find the end-boss, so you have the ability to turn the color on and off at will. Of course this all can be mixed and matched. Mid-boss that requires the weapon, an end boss that requires turning the color on or off, etc. Overworld (desert), that required you to solve a puzzle to bring out the mid boss, that if defeated makes the final temple rise from the sand, etc.\n\nThe overarching game mechanics are the colors and abilities. Normal enemies can only be killed with the weapon of their color, or vice versa, or turning that color on or off. A combination of enemies could pose a problem, as red enemies for instance create rings of fire, that you need to duck under, but sand enemies bury and come out of the floor. \n\nScope: \n\n* 8 temples, consisting of entrance, path to mid boss, mid boss, path to end boss and end boss, with color switch, weapon ability and color switch ability sprinkled throughout.\n* 2 or 3 enemies, mid boss and end boss for all 8 colors\n* collectibles in all temples (to make people go back later to temples they finished with other abilities)\n\n"
5d1o7n,My game idea,"My game idea would be a game where you are some kind of 'protocol'(a person-like character that is in a game) and you can upload a 'ghost program' and you can download software into any human body. You can stay in the body for a max. of 2 in-game months. In this game, you can do whatever you want in this body before restarting what your whole life.

5cwrqo,"Idea for linear, sandbox style crafting game.","A brutal dark souls type game but more out in the open, in the daylight. Combat is tough but fair and failure has lating consequences.  Crafting is as open as your mind can make it... or the developers can manage.\n\nYou start as a young boy, backstory pending, in the woods.  Your character mentions the woods can be dangerous so you should find something to defend yourself with.  There is a branch that has fallen off a tree nearby so your grab it and are prompted to craft something with it.  Zoom in to the ground, your hands in front of you and the branch laying on the ground.  You pick up the branch and are given context clues to pick it up or hit it with either hand and the option to blow.  So you pick up the branch with your right hand and grab on to it with your left hand as well and you can see a new option: bend, which you choose and you break the branch in half.  You then take one half of the branch and beat it on the ground a few times and you see a rudimentary shape of a knife or stabbing stick form.  Then you look around and find another branch, this time you beat it on the ground and you are eventually left with a club shaped item.  \n\nWith your two options of defense you walk onwards when confronted with a man in front of a camp fire.  You decide to approach him and talk and while wary, he talks with you.  Due to social awkwardness you fumble enough lines to make the guy distrust you enough to attack.  The man comes for you and the world slows down just a bit due to your adrenaline coursing through your veins so you see him pull a knife and lunch.  You swing the club but a bit too late so your wrist gets cut but you knock him off guard just enough to come in for a stab with your pointy stick and you connect.  A few more close calls and deft counter attacks and you're the victor.\n\nYou crouch over the body grab his knife from his hand.  Yours now.  Whoops, clicked the action button again and your character has now splayed his arm open.  Odd, but let's see where this goes. You click again and you have removed the skin from his arm, now yours.  Again and you have removed the muscles from his arm, now yours. Another click and you sever the tendons and remove his bones, also yours.  You're a bit queasy now but you have a new knife, a couple bones (maybe they'll come in handy), some meat (god forbid it comes to that) and some skin... Maybe you'll dry it out and make a new wallet or a handle for your blade.\n\nBut first, your wrist is dripping with blood.  You look through his clothing for any medkits or bandages and find nothing (why would you think there are medkits in this game?).  But wait, the clothes!  You use your new blade on your victims shirt and cut off a strip, then use it on your wrist to stem the flow of blood.\n\nYour wound will form a scar which because it was so poorly bandaged causes a slight 1-2% decrease in function of that hand when it comes to crafting, fighting, fishing, really anything you use that hand for.\n\nIf only you would have known that the herbs growing next to the victim were really good for deep cuts when ground to a paste.\n\nThe idea behind the game is an open sandbox inside a linear story driven game.  All crafting options are open to you from the beginning but no knowledge of your ability to use them.  That knowledge will be gained by playing the game and trying things out on your own.  That herb growing over there?  Put it in some hot water and drink the tea made from it, see what effect it has on you and put that knowledge to use later.\n\nThe combat system should not be very difficult but will require a level head and reading the movements of your opponent.  Any failings can be detrimental if not devastating to your long term health.  Of course, even if your lose a hand you can fashion a remedy for that; some lashings, a couple braces made from wood laying about and at the end a large double sided blade you made from fashioning a furnace out of rocks and smelting down some orange rocks you found that contained some kind of metal, poured in to a cast made out of dirt in the ground.\n\nWhat do you think?  I know I would play the hell out of this game."
5cwaak,A game where you fight an enemy that can infiltrate your dreams.,"Most of the game takes place in an ordinary suburban neighborhood, where you meet this supernatural villain. You have to fight them not only there, but eventually you have to go to sleep, so he infiltrates your dreams to fight you there. Every day you must sleep, and the dream world is surreal and unpredictable with shifting scenes and confusing physics. However, if you are smart enough, there'd be a way to gain control of your dreams and use them to your advantage. However, if you die in your dream, you wake up, and you don't get to try again until the next night, when there's a new dream, not the previous one."
5cvx62,Meme Economy,The economy of memes is up and down. Spongebob memes (SPB) peaked earlier this year and have remained strong via Twitter. Pokemon GO memes (PMG)  peaked during the game's popularity. Harambe memes (HMB) didn't peak until weeks after his death.\n\nMy idea is a game that focuses on using social media and data mining to simulate a meme economy in which players can have a substantial impact by buying and selling shares in trending memes.\n\nPlayers could start with a small amount of cash and an open market. The game could fuse with the idle genre (such as Adventure Capitalist) to allow for cash generation depending on current stock holdings. It would be best as a casual mobile phone game.
5cvbh4,An infinite 3D skyscraper exploring game.,"**Opening**\n\nIt could start out with this cutscene where you find out the backstory of your character. He's a schizo who sees evil wraiths that attack and torture people in front of him when no one else is looking.\n\nThis guy's sense of direction is horrible, and he just moved to the big city for special treatment, but there are way too many wraiths out there! He quickly gets caught up in the (horror?) of evading the wraiths in the big city.\n\n...\n\n**Some Weird Mechanics**\n\nThe game has a lot of room for a level designer to add content gradually. Rooms and areas can be made by creating 1x1x2 cell shoe boxes that connect like lego bricks or tetris in every direction.\n\nOne interesting mechanic of the game, as the guy has no sense of direction, is that when you're inside a room, any door could lead to a roof or another room, or to the street. When you're on the street, the map generates a randomly winding inner city road system that goes on forever, with skyscrapers and a few parks. If you reach a rooftop, the game generates a ton of stuff that you could potentially climb on, like a fire escape, and windows that you could potentially break into, and other rooftops, etc.\n\nWhen you look down from a rooftop area, you see a ways down, then it fades into darkness, like the buildings are blocking all of the light. When you look up, it does the same thing, except it gets too bright to see anything. You never can really be sure what time of day it is, the guy is too freaked out to worry about day or night.\n\n...\n\n**Technical**\n\nThe game could keep track of the height you're at, say, at 0+2 or 3, you may be able to see the street if you reach a window or an outside area. If you're above that, you'll just see the blackness. If you're way way up, you will reach a point where there are just a bunch of rooftops.  Also if you're way up, and you encounter a wraith, you may also encounter an angel that could smite the wraith(?) IDK.\n\nThen again, you may favor the lower levels. Of course, those are mostly the maintenance and plumbing and all that stuff down there, and maybe randomly generated subway systems at some point, but then way way down, it could get redder and hotter and who knows what's down there.\n\n...\n\n**Look/Theme**\n\nI think I could reasonably leave it up to whoever would want to make the game to think of their own quests and things, but I think it should be modeled very similarly to GTA or that one old game vampire the masquerade.\n\n...\n\n**Rating**\n\nThis would definitely be a horror game. Probably adult rating. You would see these horrible scary creatures sorta float/walking around when you're in a low population area, and then you turn the corner, and there's this wraith glaring at you, torturing someone in front of you in an alleyway, with no one else around, totally dead silence. Or you could encounter a bunch of them finishing someone off, and then they catch your scent and scream/laugh and rush toward you. The first time, for tutorial sake, you faint from fear and wake up in a hospital bed with the doctor telling you that your heart can't take that kind of stress again...\n\n...\n\n**Scenarios**\n\n?\n\n...\n\n**Multiplayer**\n\nI think it would be really cool to incorporate multiplayer into this. It could be a random multiplayer, where the game silently connects you with another player by discreetly merging cells together. Of course, some people would have to play the game as co-op... For co-op, you are able to run into separate cells, but you will keep randomly entering the same cell as your ally. So you could put several other player's ID's into the multiplayer slot, and the game would keep merging your worlds and keep you coincidentally crossing paths over and over.\n\n...\n\n**Main Content**\n\nEvery game has to have a way to win, so since my premise is that the guy is schizo, it should probably either be some kind of 'how long can you survive' type game, except not with the usual zombies, I mean, maybe you could have zombies, too...\n\n...\n\nThis could go one of two ways. You could discover a secret holy place, probably a church, and you could join this secret demon slaying group that teaches you spells that you can use against the wraiths. You can increase your power by finding holy relics like jewelry and daggers, but the power affects your body and soul. As you gain more power, your body starts to adopt some angelic abilities. You seem to be able to leap extra far, and you may find a feather or two afterwards. You feel as though a light is radiating from you, making it easier to see in dimmer areas. Your powers seem to get stronger as you go upwards through the levels of the skyscrapers.\n\nor...\n\nYou can go down, deep into the earth, where everything is hot with a faint red glow. There, you will find groups of devil worshipers, and you'll get a chance to join their group and learn their chants and rituals of power. You can crawl around and wreak havoc and destroy things and climb walls with your claws as you gain evil power.\n\n...\n\n**Endgame**\n\nNot really sure how the game ends... Maybe it doesn't? Maybe, as you play, or as you gain power, things just get more and more dangerous and chaotic until you can't avoid it anymore? Maybe you gain holy power and go deep down and defeat the devil or the leader of the wraiths? Maybe it's a huge plot twist, and you end up meeting your psychiatrist who turns out to be your nemesis, or you somehow find your apartment room and decide to take the pills and you feel all better, and roll the credits..."
5cszyh,What is the best level design to show off above-average indie lighting?,"I am an indie developer that has finished making some above-average (for an indie game) lighting techniques (shadows, godrays, etc). I want some ideas of types of levels that would really show this stuff off.\n\nJust imagine it is a textbook, story-starved, modern-ish, first-person shooter, with tech flavor. I experimented with it being in an earth forest, which looked cool, but seemed too low budget and didn't fit the tech(ish) theme.\n\nRight now I am leaning towards it taking place in a space station (to also go with the tech theme). Level design is my weakest area of game development, so lemme know what you guys think. Thanks!"
5cs9b5,Dog House.,"In Doghouse, you play as Jack. You are a simple young teenager, a boy with, your parents believe, is a heart of gold. You move into a small home in an equally  small town in England, a small home. You feel slightly out of place as an American, you are simply a fish out of water. Everyone is different from you. Though, some are more different than others. Some are dangerous. \n\nThe town is simply a small rural town. It seems to be on the peak of a boom, a boom that never comes. Half of the town is made of grim concrete, new buildings, and flats. The other half is made of Victorian towns, old parks, farms and farmland, and forests. There was a clear split. On a certain road, it went from modern grimy housing to a rocky hill to a paved road out into the farmlands. The farmlands are made up of cornfields, fields of barley, some for farm animals; cows and horses mostly. The town is so small, there is no fast food place within it, there is simply antique shops and some odd shops; model shops, hobby shops, cafes, comic shops, and other things. The 21st century would seem out of place in this town and, most of the time, it does.\n\nAlthough, during the day, the lands seem cheery. At night, the town is basked in darkness. Only the most sparsely placed street lamps and security lambs lit up the road. People were basked in shadows until they were almost a meter away, headlights would completely light up the surrounding area. This would leave anyone feeling exposed as they were lit up instantly, changing from light to dark in almost an instant. The small town had a different face at night. \n\nJack, being a boy in the 21st century, has a smartphone and a laptop. He can access videos, social media, research and look things up, as any normal teenage boy can. Through social media, Jack finds out more about the town, hearing the confessions that people display publicly on their accounts. Jack finds out more, from newspapers posted online, news articles, and the internet myths surrounding his town. However, Jack has to gain “friends” to learn about the town. Jack, having moved into his house on the weekend, has to wait until he goes to school on Monday. \n\nThe Saturday and Sunday are, simply, passed by. They unpack, revealing some of their character traits until it flashes to Monday. Jack looking at himself in the mirror while he slips his uniform on. A blazer, a tie, a shirt, black shoes and trousers. A very formal uniform, even for a public school. He puts his phone into his pocket and goes to school.\n\nJack can quickly make friends on Monday. Yet, it is quickly revealed that his friends are not what they seem. From their conversations that they briefly share, they seem normal enough. Yet, if Jack does some digging on their social media instead of doing homework or playing videogames, he can find out what his friends have been doing. Some are normal from shoplifting to animal abuse. Yet, from the likes on these posts, it seems as if these are popular ideas. Jack searches through social media in a few ways; he can search tags, scroll through profiles, follow links to find different pages, and trek down many different binary rabbit holes to find disturbing information on his town. This information can be videos of grotesque nature, images of horrible acts, posts that describe horrifying things and pages that show the history of the town as a dangerous place to be. All of this information can make Jack not feel safe. He feels as if the town has gone crazy.\n\nThis theory continues to gain evidence when the girls start showing up at his house. They invited him to come out, go to parties and other teenage things. Sometimes, when they go out, Jack can catch conversations between the girls, talking about what they’ve done. If he gets caught, Jack is in some deep trouble.\n\nJack is in the Doghouse."
5cryxe,RPG where you end up losing everything as the victory scene.,"This may sound kind of a dark kind of game, and really the overall concept would not be a dark game.  It would be dark, and depressing, but at the end you're the hero at the cost of everything.\n\nSo the first few hours of the game would be a lot of time skips.  Basically highlighting your life.  The monster hunter who turns hero.  Gets a party of friends, falls in love with the female hero.  End of the campaign they hook up.  Standard RPG fare.  But over the next bit the gameplay shifts to the hero's child.  A son who is held to high expections not only from his parents, but from the community, his friends, even his romantic partners.  And he basically begins to suffer from self loathing.\n\nAs time goes on he becomes cold, and while he excels he hates himself and everyone around him.  After joining the military and quickly becoming a higher person of power thanks to his parentage.  But he now judges everyone with the same standards people put onto him.  He starts a coup and assassinates the leaders of the country. \n\nAt this point the view shifts back to the much older original hero who is in his late 40s-early 50s.  And the true game would involve working under your son as a military officer, but would turn against him due to his cold/warlike nature.  And end up having to flee to another country with your wife.  \n\nThe end of the game would be where your wife would die in battle, and you kill your son.  Restoring the country, but with nothing left for you, you end up alone and hurt and maybe end up killing yourself."

5co5tv,[Intermediate] Crazy Cat Lady: Vengeance,"They call you the Crazy Cat Lady. It doesn't really matter that you're (mostly) sane and only own one cat (not counting various strays, their litters, random tomcats, indoor cats who sneak over to your house for treats, etc. etc.). \n\nYou're fed up with the neighborhood kids and their name-calling, so you've decided to build up a cat army and go on the attack.\n\nTask 1: Build up cat army.\n\nBreed your cat. \n\nAdopt frequently visiting cats: build up trust by feeding them often, giving them treats, and placing treats or toys inside your home to lure them in.\n\nPrint and put up false ""Lost Cat"" posters to have cats hand-delivered to your door.\n\nVisit the store on weekends and you might catch an Adopt-a-thon, where you can purchase a kitty from the local Humane Society, if you have the money.\n\nSome adopted cats will be spayed or neutered, but having more than two breedable cats and keeping them happy and fed will yield a litter.\n\nTask 2: Train your kitties for battle.\n\nBuild up your cats' skills with toys that encourage running (speed), pouncing (attack / speed), biting (attack / damage), and sneaking (stealth).\n\nSharpen their claws (damage) and encourage sneakiness (stealth) with towering cat trees and fortresses.\n\nUse materials in your home or purchased toys from the store to teach your kitties. Unlock new skill moves and new items by reaching milestones.\n\nCats who are pregnant, overfed, too fat (have been overfed for too long), or lazy (have been happy for too long) will not build skills at all or will build them slowly. Kittens build skill very fast but are also more prone to injury and random running away. \n\nTask 3: Wreak havoc on the snot-nosed kids in your neighborhood.\n\nAssign kitties to target specific houses, or let your kitties run loose where they like.\n\nLure kids to your home with ""Lost Cat"" posters, ""Free Kittens"" posters, asking for help home from the store, offers of payment for overdue newspaper route bills, or offers of pocket money for cleaning your garage / mowing your lawn.\n\nBe careful! Kittens might get adopted by neighborhood kids and sneaked out of your house, or kept when they run away. \n\nNot all neighborhood kids are bad -- your cats might even decide they LIKE them. Neighborhood kids might leave out food, treats, or toys, or have cats of their own that your cats like. Be sure your cats are ready for the battle!\n\nTask 4: Maintenance.\n\nPay for your cats' food, toys, medicine, kitties from the Adopt-a-thon, and the cost of printing all those posters with your measly monthly stipend from the government.\n\nAlternately, you can spend time crafting items to sell at the Craft Fair on weekends (costs time, earns money, opens up unique toys to train cats), renting your cats out as mouse-catchers (costs cats, earns money, cats must have skill qualifications, improves skill levels, can be risky -- cats can get injured), or getting a part-time job at the local PetStop as a cat spa attendant (costs time, earns money, occasional free food or toys as a bonus, improves the health of cats at home, can lead to cat laziness or obesity).\n\nClean up after your cats and feed them daily. Unhappy cats make an unhappy home!\n\nWatch out for Animal Control if you've been letting your cats run loose or have posted too many ""Lost Cat"" / ""Free Kittens"" posters. If you have too many cats, many pregnant cats, or a very dirty house when Animal Control arrives, they'll take ALL your cats and you'll have to start over!\n\nWatch out for the police if you've lured too many kids to your home and sent them running.\n\nYOU WIN when all neighborhood kids have moved away and you still have at least two cats.\n\nChallenges to extend or alter the main game, like seeing how many cats you can maintain in a house, or how many successive generations you can breed and train of a particular type of cat, give the game high replay factor.\n\nIf the cats age, taking care of older cats, constructing a cat graveyard, and harnessing the energy of kittens for training all come into play."

5ckra7,A VR game where you're a wheelchair user.,"Most problems I have seen with VR is that most of the games you're standing up and moving around. and one complaint about them is that people who have disabilities are left unable to play. But what about a game where you have to control a wheelchair. This fixes problem with movement too, as most games I have watched have people either in a small area or teleporting around. Some ideas could be, \n\nA horror game where you must wheel yourself around with a torch. This means to move you must put the touch down making it hard to see around.\n\nThe second idea I have is a shooter with the same premise of needing to put the weapon down to move. \n\nGames like this could help give people insight into people left unable to move normally. I have no idea if this has been done, but if done right, it could help give people insight into a disability that games hardly touch on."

Whoever wins, well, wins, but with a twist. There's a spike wall coming from the left, right, top, bottom, whatever, and all of the players have to avoid the spike wall. If any of the players dies from the spike wall, they either lose points, or all lose the round, I'm not sure which, so people have to help people away from the spike wall in order to defeat them."

5cjo94,"Red vs. Blue, Homoioi style!","&gt;*""Spartans! What is your profession?""*\n\n&gt;*""HOU! HOU!""*\n\nThe concept is as simple as it gets.  A First Person 'shooter-like,' that has a them that takes place in Ancient Greek Antiquity.  Red Team would, naturally, be Sparta, the glorious militant warrior culture of fertile Laconia, whose warriors and women were literally bred to be the very definition of an Olympian athlete.  Blue Team would be mighty Athens, its greatest rival in power whose concepts of democracy found the framework of the modern free world.  The story (if it was to have one) would be that it would take place in the great Peloponnesian Wars, the war in which Sparta's League of Peloponnesus did battle with Athens and its Corinthian League for the right to rule a united Greece, a war perhaps in direct aftermath with the Greco-Persian Wars of legend.\n\nThe beauty of this concept is in its simplicity.  In terms of gameplay it could simply borrow from or emulate pre-existing first person games that use melee weapons as its combat focus; such examples would include Dark Messiah of Might and Magic on the Source engine, or Chivalry: Medieval Warfare on Unreal 3.  Maps could imitate real-world replicas of ancient Greek antiquity, with battlegrounds including the Parthenon, Arcadia, the streets of Corinth, perhaps even storied Thermopylae itself.  The art style could be kept abstract with a noticable Greek theme; not necessarily on the same level as Apotheon, but definitely at minimum comparable with the art style of games like Team Fortress 2.  Game modes would likely include the simple stuff like capture the flag, control points, king of the hill, and point defense.  Classes will be built based on the weapons and economic classes of the age, with Peltasts acting as mobile, fairly weak scouts while Hoplites act as hard-hitting linemen troops."
5citma,An online story-based twin-stick shooter.,"Ok, take a look at the Binding of Isaac. That's a twin stick shooter. So is Enter the Gungeon, Nuclear Throne, and a lot of other games. Almost all of them seem to be single-player (perhaps with local multiplayer) games, with permadeath.\n\nThis game would be unique. You would have a band of players (maybe a duo to maybe a group of 15?) that would have to go through a dungeon together. There would be the stuff like shops and item rooms, yeah, but the game would be centered around the fact that you have multiple people with you."
5ci7w8,Life Inside *Prison Game*,"So imagine an online based prison game, not just a level but an actual full game based on being one of two sides the guards or the inmate you can play as either. Guards do the obvious duties of what a prison guard would do. Make sure inmates behave themselves, make sure they follow the schedule set for them like roll call and any jobs they been assigned to, tossing cells for any contraband, preventing escape and prison gangs doing illegal activity. Inmates would be asked to follow the rules but in the end it's their own choice what they do with their time as long as they are not caught out by guards. A lot like the escapists game but with added elements for inmates to start their own prison gangs or become smugglers or of course if they want to be a Michael Scofield and escape with an elaborate plan.\n\n\nNow I know there's many games and mods that RP this but I have yet to see any go the full way or be as good as it can be. So I will list the requested features of this game and others are free to input their ideas too.\n\nAlso if the game can be 3d based then all the better 1st or 3rd person mode would be more favoured.\n\n\n•Inmates can create gangs\n\n\n•Guards can have a warden to issue orders \n\n\n•Solitary Confinement for offending inmates\n\n\n•Drugs/smuggling system for inmates\n\n\n•Weapons\n\n\n•Various methods of escape but not too easy (something similar to escapists would be reasonable)\n\n\n•food/hydration system\n\n\n•inmates have a task/objective/schedule waypoints different times of the day for prison jobs, canteen, free time.\n\n\n•Different jobs gives inmates access to different tools and equipment that can be used for various purposes such as weapons or escape tools.\n\n\n•Guards can initiate lockdown and cell tosses if a prisoner goes missing or a lot of contraband is found. \n\n\n•A Prison of decent size that gives inmates a reasonable chance of maneuvering and performing activities out of guards sight with also elements to allow them to sneak around out of their cells during lockdown such as ventilation etc.\n\n\n•Guards can use riot gear if necessary. Example if there is riot and either guard or inmate gets killed.\n\n\n•Repairing feature to fix any damage tot he prison structure e.g. tunnels or damaged fences and holes.\n\n\n•Guards become inmates if they abuse their powers or get fired/kicked from server if there is no imate spaces.\n\n\n\nSo there is my list of features at the top of my head of course once I re read this and read some comments we can add to this list or change it etc. But also the endgame of this would be cool if we have a point based system. So think of it like a tug of war  bar system were the blue half represents the guards and the red inmates. So if the bar for example is completely blue the guards win and if red then inmates. So the way the bar would fill would depend on how efficient the prison is being run. So if the inmates caused enough violence by killing inmates and guards alike with drugs being successfully smuggled and sold as well as prisoners escaping then each time it happens would add a negative point to guards and therefore filling the  bar more red than blue. Guards however will gain points by preventing escapes, finding contraband, fixing escape damage (if the prisoner has not escaped already) Putting prisoners in solitary for their crimes. Preventing violence and of course productivity of the prisoners work force on their jobs. So if the guards win then prisoners will lose but if inmates win the prison is shut down.  Keep in mind this would be all online or at least AI guards if not possible. \n\n•""Added Ideas""•\n\n•EXP/REP for players which can be used on either attribution improvements on thing like strength, speed, sneak. Or a skill tree. Money earned in each match shall we call it gets reset every match to provide a fair experience for new comes but experienced players still benefit form a skill system or rep system. \n\n•Different security prisons for players depending on their level to add a more fair playing ground. Minimum security for level 1-15 medium for 15 - 30 high for -30 to 50\n  and maximum for 50 and over.\n\n•Prisoners get their XP/REP through their activity while doing their scheduled work/jobs gives them minimal reward but non legitimate/higher risk activity provides more rewarding points. However if they fail they will lose ingame time by serving it in solitary. Players who quit game to find another server for their XP/REP will still need to wait the allotted time they were meant to serve in solitary but in main menu instead and can lose their XP progress for not completing the match.\n\n•Prisoners who escape prison will earn a very high amount of rep/xp and will either return as the same inmate which will come with high solitary but gives them double xp/rep for the rest of the game. Or they return as a new inmate with no solitary but regular xp/rep that adds onto their already earned rep/xp.\n\n•Crafting System with someone like the escapists type system and maybe even restrict some crafting options to certain skill trees.\n\n•Guards have access to basic equipment. Higher leveled guards can unlock more equipment such as tasers, tear gas, flash bangs and bean bag shotguns/rubber bullets and even lethal (which can only be used if necessary). Higher level guards will eventually also have to go to higher level prisons also. This makes the game very replayable as there is a double leveling system one for inmates and one for guards.\n\n•Various jobs can give you various benefits. Working in laundry gives you access to gaurd uniforms which cna help aid escapes. Cooking jobs in the kitchen gives you access to knives or food or even an area for you to smuggle drugs through. landscaping can give you shovels or the ability to craft objects like ladders etc.\n\n•Cooldowns. Example warden of the prison can issue a lockdown which will close all doors in the prison for a certain amount of time. This can be beneficial if handling a riot as this will keep prisoners within cells and prisoner who are out of their cells will not be able to move around as easy in the prison during the time limit giving guards time to do whatever they need to do like regroup, handle a situation and compose themselves/ prepare. Inmate gangs could trigger a cooldown that gives them lockpicks or a keycard for a certain amount of time allow them access to usually secured doors in the prison with access to places such as armouries or escape routes but obviously not the main prison gate. Of course this will be undetected unless caught by guard in restricted areas.\n\n•pastime games such as sports, board games and prison games alike for players who just want to RP the prison life.\n\n•Guard Restraining system for inmates. More than one guard can help restrain if the inmate has a high strength attribute. Maybe a button/key mash or button/key sequence based restraining  system. More guards who help the easier it will be for the guards and harder for the inmates. Of course the same can apply to inmates restraining inmates or guards for whatever purpose. However the inmates will need to steel cuffs first while the guards have them to begin with. You can even steal the current guard you are attempting to restrain cuffs if a inmate helps hold them down.\n\n\n•""Games I used for Inspiration For This Idea""•\n\n•Escapists https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8ncpPunOzA\n\n•Chronicles of Riddick: Escape From butcher Bay https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1i6TftSJdVg\n\n•Prison Break:The Conspiracy https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQsmD8-vfQs \n\n•Garry's Mod Both Prison RP and JailBreak https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_STFAcby8M and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCj_bYTuljs\n\n•Mafia 2 (Jail level) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8X76GEcqWg8\n\n•The Warriors (Cops restraining System) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tWn_T20eUE\n\n•Most of all for inspiration I would suggest you play an Arma 3 Life Mod the more serious ones have a court system and jail and is mostly roleplayed however not so much on the prison it's more of a cop puts you in jail and sets a timer. But the restraining abilities and features may help with the idea for this game. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuCl1FXyZak&amp;t=79s\n\n•Roblox also has a gamemode with similar ideas to this game as well. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rqk_W9GmHac and also https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvUCHRRKCqU\n\n•Prisoner Of War is an old game but is very similar to this idea. I would say this mixed with escapists is what I am looking for. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCTLXBC9Nq8\n\n• The Great Escape https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GeYEK2_1D0\n\n• Chicken Run https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5O86ODLVsxc\n\n\n(hope this helps with anyone willing to take up the idea, personally I feel due to the idea and originality of this game and lack of others like it, This would be very popular and I can see a lot of people getting into this.)"

580a3u,F2P Cops and Robbers Game,"So I've had this idea in my head for a while. My idea is a free to play, 10 on 10 multiplayer, cops vs robbers game. It would follow the structure of the popular child game (Cops try to catch robbers, robbers run away), but would have aspects to it only possible in a video game, such as high speed car chases, dangerous stunts, etc. You would be able to collect new cars to drive, and new characters to play as, each with their strengths and weaknesses. The graphics would follow the same style as other F2P FPS games, such as Overwatch and TF2. This would be the classic free-to-play first person shooter with a cool, chaotic, twist to it."

Each round should not take more than a couple minutes, so you can play a ""best of 3"" in a coffee break. \n\nThe idea is that a customer walks in a blacksmith shop, and asks for a random item (example: metal hammer) and a quality (normal, legendary, etc). The player is supposed to make that something, or as similar as possible. Limited amount of turns to create and improve the item. \n\nHeavily work in progress, but after working for the past few years on serious, ""commercially viable"" products, I just wanted a silly, quick game.

57yntp,Another medieval game.,"Btw sry for bad english.\n\nI know there are many games like mount and blade, life is feudal etc, but i think this one can be different.\n\nThe basic idea of the game is that the player can live in the game (play for a good amount of hours) and dont get bored or feel like he is doing the same thing over and over again.\n\nIt would be a open world map, big but not too much.\nThe player spawn in the world and have the ability to spawn one house where he wants to, if the terrain is good for it. By that what i'm trying to do is make players create groups, and spawn theyr houses making tiny villages here and there. The map will have 1 or 2 bigger citys, made by mostly houses where players can't enter or interact, 1 inn where they can buy drinks food and rest with friends etc, a blacksmith and some other tiny shops where they can sell or buy.\nI think the amount of time a player will have to walk to one of the citys to another should be like 10 minits, cuz of course there would be animals, badits(players), maybe villages, maybe 10 is too much.\n\nThe game would have like 2 or 3 mounts, a caravan, horse and maybe a donkey, the horse being the fast mount for solo or bandits, caravan for comerce and donkey for short distance travels.\n\nAlso by the 10 min walk betwen city or villages i want to force players travel in groups. By now the game can get bored and \nmonotone. what can players can do for now:\n*Make villages\n*Be bandits\n*Hunt animals for different resources\n*drink and Roleplay  ;)\n\nThe doors of the houses spawn by players can get destroyed by specific weapons and need wood to reapir them, now what I want to do here is: the player outside the village or city feels danger, mostly by night, but once in the village he should feel safe and can freely move around the lights of the village, so when a group of badits iis attacking a villages, the owners of each house will feel real danger since attacking a villages means players with good weapons hunting for gold and resources. \n\nPlayers that don't want to leave too ofthen for hunt and maybe die can chose to farm, so players can have tiny farms around the house, like 4 or 5 m, maybe more. they can grow stuff, sell it, eat, trade with others players. so now they can:\n\n*Farm\n\nAs you can see, players will need food, when the spawn the house, they will get some food and wate. also they recive a bad sword and axe\n\nSoo... for now the game can still get monotone or boring after a time, i'm thinking about more  features, but for now the game have a lot of things i think. Ohh and the graphics must not be last gen or close to, so simpli gamer pc can run it.\n\nFeel free to criticize.\n\n\n"
57y0c2,New Bioshock Game Idea,"This Bioshock game will take place in the deep subterranean. The city is a cult city to avoid Armageddon run by a rich patriarchal family  and is power by thermal energy. The Story will take place in the late 19th century. The game will be using Unreal 4. The customization system will have a Bioshock 1-2 feel but the core gameplay will feel like an evolved form of Bioshock Infinite. It will not take place in the Colombia or Rapture timeline. This time you are taken Prisoner to the city because you were at the wrong place at the wrong time and now you have to escape. it will recapture the survival horror tone of Bioshock 1 with the art style feeling very HR Giger esque.  Technology run by mental capacity takes place of Plasmids and Vigors, Think a wristband and a wire inside your arm like System Shock 2."

57wk1x,Powercreep - The procedurally generated card battle game,"**Powercreep**\n\nThe procedurally generated card battle game\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nPowercreep is not your typical digital card battle game. Powercreep aims to simulate the life of an average TCG by upping the power level of cards with each new set released. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIn power creep all cards are randomly generated but are constrained to a number of parameters. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Set 1 - Example Basic Bear creature.**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Adjective] [Location]] Bear - Cost (between 1-5)\n\n\nType - Bear \n\n\n[Ability? Yes / No ]\n\n\n[If yes] When~ [ - ETB / When dies ] [ Gain (Cost + -1to4) life / lose (Cost + -1to4) life  / deal (Cost +  -1to4) damage to target player / deal damage]\n\n\nAttack [Cost + -1to2 ] Life [Cost + -1 to 3]\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**IE.**   Lonely Forest Bear - 3 Mana - Bear -  4 attack 2 life \n\n**IE.**   Mystic Polar Bear - 1 Mana - Bear When ~ ETB lose 2 life. 3 attack 4 life.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOnce you complete a tournament a new set of randomly generated cards is released but this new set will have much higher margin of parameters and complexity than the previous sets.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSome examples of this below:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Set 1 - Example Direct Damage spell.**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Adjective] [Fire word] - Cost (between 1-6)\n\n\n~ Deals [Cost + (1-3)] Damage to [Target Player / Target Creature / Target creature or player]\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIE.   Lovely Inferno - 3 Mana - ~ Deal 4 damage to target creature\n\nIE.   Hateful Spark - 1 Mana - ~ Deal 3 damage to target creature or player.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Set 3 - Example Direct Damage spell.**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Adjective] [Fire word] - Cost (between 1-8)\n\n\n~ Deals [Cost + (1-6)] Damage to [Target Player / Target Creature / Target creature or player / All Creatures / All players / All players and creatures] \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIE.   Sick Burn - 1 Mana - ~ Deal 7 damage to target creature or player\n\nIE.   Uncontrollable Magma - 4 Mana - ~ Deal 5 damage all creatures and players.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe game itself would feature you playing as a young protagonists fighting randomly generated opponents to earn extra packs and entering tournaments.  Cards are obtained through booster packs and extras can be sold although at a very cheap price. You can also work in your father's card shop as a mini game to grind for extra money, this is very important if you’ve opened very rubbish cards and need the more powerful ones from the set. While working at the shop every now and then a player will come in to sell a card which you can buy from them. \n\nThere is two battle modes - **This set** and **All cards.** In this set you can only use cards from a particular set and All cards mean you can mix and match cards from any set available to you. You must win a tournament of each of these to unlock a new set coming out. \n\nAs for the actual card battle system, maybe some kind of lane combat similar to solforge would work.   I haven't thought too much into it. \n\nJust my shower thoughts really. Sadly I don't have the time or commitment to actually make this game but it sounds awesome in my head!"
57vxjv,"Multiplayer Instanced PvE/PvP in a WoW-like combat system, but no questing or grinding to reach ""beginning of the real game""","I'm actually looking to develop something like this, but I'm brand new so this is just a pipe dream of my own. But here goes.\n\nBasic idea is that it's that 3D tab targetting, spell heavy combat system that exists in WoW, FFXIV, and many other MMORPGs, but strip off all the more tedious parts--leveling to max, questing, rep grinds, etc. What's left is the instanced PvE/PvP and gear progression systems.\n\nYou'd have the tank/healer/dps roles as usual, with a set of classes that can perform various roles based on their advancement (spec). You'd have various sizes of content, like solo, 3, 5, 10, 20 with varying difficulty levels. You'd have different maps for battlegrounds and arenas. All of the fun of endgame mmo content, but much more easily accesible.\n\nI have a fair amount of details written about how I would implement something like this, such as the class specifics (including a fourth role of support, based on buffing/debuffing), a leveling system based off completion of instances, leaderboards and replayability for the hardcore crowd, etc. But alas, a ""game designer"" can only do so much alone.\n\nBut, the real key points are just the combat system and the intense focus on it being about the instances rather than open-world questing to get to a level cap ""before the real game begins."" "
57szzm,Door Kickers but with Mechs,"Take the basic mechanics of Door Kickers, drawing a path and customizing units, but have Mechwarrior-esque customization.  Units would take damage based on where they are hit and need to have the core destroyed to be 'killed'.  For example, when a Mech's leg is destroyed it is slowed and limps affecting accuracy. Or say an arm is destroyed, or wherever it's housed, the weapon is gone with a chance of exploding causing damage to nearby areas. \n\nTL;DR Mechwarrior version of Door Kickers"
57r82t,Naval Strategy game for mobile,"The idea I propose is for a strategy naval combat game. A realistic but not complex simulation of the kinds of decisions admirals make. A simpler version of ""Harpoon"" for mobiles. Consider these points:\n- vast majority (or all) of gameplay takes place on the map. The player's role is to issue simple commands to warships (either individual or task forces)\n- These commands would include go to a point on the map, engage target, power on/off to sensor (eg radar), power on/off to weapon system.\n- Vessels would be a simplified representations of real life platforms, eg. Castle class destroyer\n- Each vessel type would have certain characteristics such as max speed, cruise speed, armour/hit points, sensors, weapons, etc.\n- Sensor and weapons would have certain characteristics too: range, arc, accuracy etc. which would show up on the map around the vessel when selected\n- When designing ships you can copy and paste the same sensors or weapons when different warships use the same systems\n- Most of the fun in the scripted missions would be the finding, approaching, stalking, attacking your targets with selected weapons. You can have very varied missions and real or made up scenarios. Escort missions, scouting for bigger vessels, guarding a border, hunting pirates - these just some ideas for scenarios \n- The two most challenging things for the developer would be a good AI and a well designed interface\n- Other than that the game should be easy to make\n- I think the map should be of the whole world with pretty accurate coastlines. It should also have a couple of optional overlays (one political map with country boundaries and one with latitude and longitude lines)\n- There is a lot to be said about including photos of the ship types included and maybe a short description with specs to increase immersion. (Accessible from the ""encyclopaedia"" tab)\n- A good soundscape would go a long way too (good fade ins and fade outs, realistic noises of engines, guns etc) I don't care much for music but I suppose it would be wise to have it too\n- I think it would be best to make the game with a somewhat limited scope at first with scenarios from world war 2. Then, when the development budget allows, more units can be added in game updates. I think the developer should make the game with the possibility of adding a broader range of weapons (eg adding modern missiles), sensors and platforms (maybe subsurface or air platforms) in later updates.\n- The price point should be high (I'm thinking $6 to $10) as it is not a product for the masses\n- If the project is managed sensibly the cost of production should be fairly low as there is little need for fancy graphics or animations. All of the action is on the map.\n- Please research the ""Harpoon"" series for PC for more ideas\n- Also, I have more ideas about specifics of this game so if you'd like to hear them please let me know.\n"
57qxyd,Paranormal Investigation VR Game,"I think this idea is quite apt, what with the approach of Halloween. :)\n\n**Genre:** Paranormal Horror/Free-roam Exploration\n**Platform:** PC/Mac/Linux\n**Perspective:** First-person with VR compatibility\n\nImagine you're a lone paranormal investigator, exploring old, abandoned places in the search for hard evidence of the existence of ghosts...\n\n**Game Features:**\n\n* No story-line or goals - just go to the purportedly haunted location and look for paranormal activity. These locations could include abandoned WWII bunkers (if anyone has seen the article about the guy who went into one of these bunkers in Germany and took some amazing photos, you'll know what I mean), shut-down asylums, old manor houses, disused prisons/jails, military naval vessels that saw battle, etc. The atmosphere if these locations is everything and half of what will make the game so creepy, besides the entities.\n\n* The ability to use gadgets like motion detectors, EMF readers, a night-vision camera and temperature gauges to try and discern the location of alleged spirits. A torch is also provided for the times you don't want to use the camera to navigate. Additionally, the player can use their microphone to call out to the entities (which will have an understanding of some basic, commonly used words or phrases to react to.) A dialogue wheel can be used optionally if the player doesn't want to or can't use their microphone. The spirits will react to things said, depending on their personality. Some might lash out, others may respond quite amicably. Cameras can also be placed around locations to catch footage whilst the player isn't there.   \n\n* Subtle visual and auditory phenomena. You'll never see a full-on apparition (no obvious jump-scares here), but will occasionally see things out of the corners of your eyes as you pan the camera around, only to find whatever it is is gone by the time you look back again. The whole game is about heightening the tension and keeping the player anxious, not outright scaring them silly. One of the biggest jump scares, for example, is placing a motion detector somewhere, leaving it, and then hearing it go off whilst you're exploring another area. Another is walking past a closed door only to hear it creak open, etc.\n\n* The 'spirits' will be A.I. entities which can also freely move about the location. They always know where the player is and have their own personalities which reflect in their actions. Some may be quite benign, choosing to interact with the player in passive ways, with some auditory phenomena and orbs (which can be seen most often with the night-vision camera, less so with the naked eye.) Others may be quite violent or unpredictable, choosing to throw objects at the player, slam doors, deliberately mess with the investigation equipment or make loud, horrific noises right next to the player.\n\n* The 'reward' system in the game is catching as much visual and auditory phenomena as possible on camera. Players are scored points on how convincing this evidence is. Each location and playthrough lasts an entire night; players can choose to leave the location at any time but are rewarded extra points for staying the entire night.      \n\nLet me know what you think guys. I have an interest in the paranormal and a game like this would be awesome I think. :)"
