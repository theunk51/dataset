az0edl,A VR game where you're a hostage trying to grab a gun you've hidden on your body,"You play as an agent that lets themselves get captured by a crime organization to get closer to the boss. At the start of the game you select where on your body to hide your gun. As the mission progresses you have to keep your hands where the guards can see them, and then at the right moment when nobody is looking grab the gun and start blasting. The guards might do a pat-down and they could find the gun if it's not well-hidden."
ayyvf0,"A Mario party clone, but it's also a crossover starring popular Indie characters.","A while ago, I had an idea for ""Nintendo Party"" a crossover game which is like Mario party meets Smash Bros. I think this would be a better idea with Indie characters for 2 reasons.\n\n1.  We only have 1 official Indie crossover game.\n2. Nintendo is very strict with their Properties.\n\nWe also have a surprising lack of of Mario Party style party games, and none that are crossover games. I would love to see a casual party crossover game."
ayybsc,LGBT Themed Horror Game,"Erika is 18 years old and ready to finish her senior year in high school. The problem is she doesn't know how she even got to this point in her life. There is no memories, no rhymes, no reasons why she is here in this life that doesn't feel like her own. The reality of her existence is unstable to the point that she sometimes finds herself in what appears to be a living nightmare, the anger and grudge of someone she does not know. She can feel it. In those creatures that seek to literally eat away at her. With each time she is here, fighting these beasts, she begins to learn. She was, will be, is the female identity of a transgender female that was brutally murdered by her uncle. The man she never was died, and Erika, the female identity, was thrust forth into the void of non-existence. It was this void that she escaped only to find herself in another void; the void left behind by a miscarriage. It was her that she tore into reality, finding herself the daughter of the couple who dealt with the miscarriage. This isn't her true home. This is a fake reality. And underneath this falsehood, inside the void, grew the grudge, fear, turmoil, anger, pain that was born from Christopher: the false identity that Erika thought she was before she was murdered. Death brought life to Erika, but death grew an evil in Christopher. Now Christopher seeks to destroy Erika for playing a part in his death while she got to live as if nothing happened. Until now."
ayy93i,A game where you build asteroid stations like in the Expanse,"A city builder type game. You have to spin an asteroid to create centrifugal pseudo-gravity, dig tunnels and create living area, hydroponic farms, power stations, oxygen generators, etc. \n\nThe closer an area is to the center, the lower the gravity but the more central the location.  People would probably want to live on the outer perimeter, but that's also where'd you want youd want to have docks and stuff. \n\nBasically a city builder with some interesting constraints. "
ayvzen,"Game like animal crossing, but grittily realistic","It would be like animal crossing (town/city simulator that takes a terrible sounding concept, but becomes a great game), but it’s more realistic, and it takes place in like a city, or something. It would be either third or first person, and you could choose from a limited selection of jobs, some might be something boring like office worker, or you could be a murderer, or a robber, or something like that ( I don’t mean for a clone of the sims or gta), the game would be an rpg, with customizable protagonist, that isn’t voiced.normal RPG progression system, with multiple skill trees, each unlocked by a job, with no MTX in game. There would be a level cap. Expansion packs could include new jobs, higher level cap, and new locations. The game could have an over-arching plot, however the game idea could work without some grand, black ops 3 zombies esque story. I know nothing about game development, and realize that a game like this would be a huge file, and expensive to create. The game would probably be priced around $60 with major expansions costing $20, and smaller expansions costing $5-$10, however the game would not have Civilization, The Sims, or Train Simulator levels of DLC. Just came up with this idea, and wanted to hear people’s thought, the base idea I’ve had for a wile (city simulator type of game) but the whole other stuff like RPG elements I thought up on the fly. I really hope I didn’t break any sub rules"

ayou5h,Murder mystery RPG,"I've had an idea floating around my head for a while now. Basically, the premise is that the story unfolds in such a way that you meet characters and eventually, there's a murder of someone very important. Or perhaps you meet them after the murder. But then something else happens. Perhaps it's supernatural like a demonic threat that requires slaying or maybe something simple like traveling across the planet to inform the family of the deceased and encountering multiple obstacles along the way. But the point is, the characters you meet at the beginning join your party. Each one has a very peculiar habit. One might collect bloodied items from defeated enemies, one might randomly vanish from your party without ever saying anything and rejoin at random times, one might be overly defensive and provoke combat from otherwise docile NPCs, etc. The point is that one of them is the murderer. \n\nDepending on various choices made over the first quarter of the, the killer may be revealed at the end of the game, and it will always be different, depending on those choices. The way to figure out who is to be suspicious of your party. The guy who collects bloody items? Repeatedly check his inventory. He might have an item only the deceased would know the significance of. The girl who disappears? Backtrack far enough, and you might find her disposing of evidence. The overly-defensive guy? Make note of what sets him off on this play through, and you may discover his motives. All of this also requires you to pay close attention to the story and the information given about the victim. \n\nAt the end of the game, you make your accusation and the last scene is the results of your choice. You'll have to go through each different scenario that lead you to your decision. If your choices are wrong, but the accusations are right, the police refuse to take action and leave, the lights go out and everyone but the killer is murdered and that's your ending. If your accusation is wrong, then everyone walks away, they all despise you, and the murderer kills again. If everything lines up, there's a final battle between your characters and the murderer, but the lights go out, the officers are killed and you have to prevent the murderer from running. This could be implemented in a variety of ways. Maybe combat will be free-roaming and you have to block the exits, maybe you get battle-specific commands like Undertale that require you to lock doors, shut windows and stay alive/fight, or maybe it's just simply timed.\n\nI know the idea isn't entirely fleshed out, but I mostly wanted to get the premise out there. I really like the idea of going through your party member's belongings as you would in any game, but doing so because you just don't trust them. Or even going to use a healing item and seeing a bloody necktie."
aymhhd,Apprentice,"This is actually something that I've been working on for bit, outline wise. But, I'm going back to school and dont have time to really start anything.  \n  \nApprentice:  \n  \nThe story begins with a knight praying over a grave. The scene cuts to the knight walking through a street, the town lively around him.\nThe knight arrives home, takes off his armor, and goes to sleep.  \n  \nA quick scene plays. It's hard to tell what is going on, but it's a dark room, the floor is lit with a eerie creaking noise.  \n  \n-------  \n  \nThe knight wakes up to the voice of a young man.  \n""Sam get up""  \n  \n""Samuel! I'm going to steal breakfast if you dont make it""  \n  \nThe young man, maybe 14, was taken in by Sam after he was abandoned at the age of 4. Sam was nicer to that boy than anyone else. But he refused to train him with a sword. This turned into the child becoming an bitter, and a thief. But likewise to Sam, he loved that old man.  \n  \n-------  \n  \n\nThe story takes us across a world where a hero is adorned for doing what was right for the kingdom, but destroyed his soul. The knight burned a village of infected people. After years of combating a new plague, the kingdom decides to purge the evil with fire..  \n  \nUnknown to the knight, his wife and daughter were admitted to the quarantine village that very day.  \n  \nAfter a violent outburst within the royal courts, and a failed suicide. A boy saves a man, by finding what he believed to be an empty, warm place to sleep. The boy found a man, hanging from the ceiling.  \n  \nSo, that's good enough for the introduction. So this doesnt take all night.  \n  \n-------  \n  \nThe gameplay I wanted to feel like SOTN with an overworld like Shovel Knight. Lots of equipment, spells/skills are used through button combos. But nothing like wall climbing or flying.  \n  \nYou go through levels playing as the knight, killing bandits, eyeballs, bats, etc. Your Apprentice(the boy) follows you as an npc. The Apprentice can be sent of optional tasks: getting fruit from a tree, helping npc's, distracting monsters. After every story level a night scene occurs where the Apprentice is training (hitting tree, starting fires, running, swimming). Depending on what optional things you do, he gets bonus non observable stats. He always levels up but optional quests will change what he gets and how much.  \n  \nThis leads to you fighting across the land, crippling and tearing apart the royal families that had the knight kill his own family. The knight slowly starts showing the boy things, teaching him lessons about critical thinking and pride.  \n  \nThe final lesson, the finals boss is Sam. The boy becomes his perfect suicide. After becoming obsessed with revenge, and then after completing his revenge, nothing changes. Sam understands that he has become a danger to the world and can no longer live with his memories.  \n  \nYou take over controlling the boy who has the same controls but is a little faster and has the skill, snack time. He stays rooted for 1.2* seconds while eating a snack, gaining hp and atk bonus for 8* seconds.  \n  \nWhen you kill sam you see the full scene of Sam trying to kill himself and the boy finding him and saving him. Scenes of Sam with him family and Sam with the boy begin to overlap and its supposed to be a touching, maybe sad ending.  \n  \nBoom! Not the end!  \n  \nPost credits the boy wakes from bed, but oh boy, that's no boy! You are now 19, and a badass.  \n  \nYou will scour the world for your own type of revenge, to honor the father you killed. You now have a couple skills(Snack Time, Air Strike, Spire and Master Mode), my favorite being Master Mode. In this mode you're covered in a shadow cloak and your attacks shoot out shadow daggers that you teleport to if you choose(double tap or something). Your movespeed and atk is also increased. When this move ends it eats 10%* of your life and you're 25%* slower for 10* seconds.  \n  \nThe world is similar but now all the royal Apprentices are adults and wants their own revenge. You kill your way across the land in a self reflective story, learning about your master and his past.  \n  \n-------  \n  \nThe final ending I dont have sadly. That's as far as I've got with it all. I do have skills and a lot of events written out. But that isn't too important here.  \n  \nWell, I know it's not very good but if anyone wants to run with this, go for it. Just contact me if it becomes anything( I wanna play!) and give me a whatever credit."
9ym0ji,"[Story/Non-mechanical] A horror game, ruined by the player character, a corny over-the-top action hero.","Maybe the abstract tag would have worked, but the description made it seem like it was for vague ideas, and while mine leaves a lot open I wouldn't call it vague.\n\nBut anyway, the game sets up a creepy story and atmosphere, and your character quickly breaks that image with a brazen action sequence, or a sudden punch to the monster's face.

9yl07b,Murder Town,9 players in total. One Hunter. 8 survivors. \n\nThe game takes place in a neighborhood known for killings. All survivors have 30 seconds to gather items in their home. They can also stop by small convenience stores to search for items too. Each survivor has a class. Medics start with healing items. Supports start with shields etc. Assaults start with weapons. Scouts start with bear traps. The survivors must find a battery and 2 gallons of fuel and also car keys to escape. They have to locate a car and get it in. The driver has to drive to the gates. There's only two cars. You have to spend 20 seconds opening the gate. Then its open for only 20 seconds and the survivors must escape. The hunters find multiple weapons and gear items to split their prey up. They can sabotage fuel and batteries. The hunter deals 10-30% damage depending on their weapon. Each survivor has 100% HP and can be healed by the medics. If a is killed they can spectate. The graphics are pixely but the environment is a bit more detailed. If the hunter kills 3 or more survivors they win. If the survivor survives they win.\n
9ygtnd,A horror game where you play as a lone soldier investigating a derelict ship infested with unknown aliens,It would be a primarily horror focused game with limited ammo reserves (let’s say it’s a civilian ship so you only have the ammo you start with and anything found in security rooms) and dark corridors only illuminated by your gun mounted flashlight\n\nThe creatures would come only one at a time and die in one or two shots but move incredibly quickly and mostly blend in to the background\n\nThere would be long periods without any enemy confrontation only leading to building the tension further and further\n\nWhen aliens are spawned they don’t appear through jump scares or scripted sequences (maybe the first one or any special variants are excluded) they are just spawned in a nearby room to the player and start following them not attacking right away but following behind for a short period\n\nIt will be a pseudo open world game with large areas of the ship open to explore until they are either cleared of aliens or the player finds a keycard/other way through to the next area\n\nMost of the development will be centred around audio design and making sure the player feels like they’re actually in a derelict spacecraft infested with unknown aliens\n\nCommunication with other characters would be limited and only through radio contact from them

9ycgyc,A open world game as a dragon,"what I mean, is a game where you play as a dragon, trying to amass gold, find food and create a army. there would be three different factions you could choose from. Humans, goblins, and orcs. goblins are the easiest to convince and control, with very little chance of them uprising, and be the weakest of the races, but also the one that is easiest find in any caves you may want to take over. Orcs are the strongest, most of them would die before listening to dragon, and they have a higher chance of rebelling, but they are much stronger than the other races. humans are mostly persuaded by gold, but a lot of them is really hard to convince, it would be best to try and use diplomacy. If you could convince one human, you could try using him as a puppet. \n\nother than the factions, I don’t know what kind of plot or story it would have. perhaps you’re trying to defeat other dragon that have there own empires. Maybe you’ll have to come up with special ways of defeating certain empires. Maybe one is ruling goblins with an iron fist and you can convince the goblins to rise up, but in turn if you are mostly using goblins, some of the goblin rebels will try to over throw you as well, and you’ll have to either, kill them, leading to more unrest among your goblins, trick them into believing you’re a goblin, or persuade them by giving them money, or making high ranking officer among your army with extra privileges.\n\nYou (the dragon) would costumisable, being able to decide, if whether have a more persuasive play style or more a focus on combat. you could choose to be a ice or fire dragon, or you can use illusions and trickery to fool people.\n\nThat’s really all I’ve got so far, sorry for any misspelling or run-on sentences."
9yba7n,The Creators Land - A Programming based MMO,"**Name:** The Creators Land\n\n**Concept Overview:**\n\n* The world is unfair and everything is worthless. The time it takes to gather resources is not worth the value sold.\n\n* Items cost an incredibly ludicrous sum of money and each upgrade is exponentially higher in cost.\n\n* The player is forced to employ ""bots"" to make any progress in this world.\n * Bots are Humanoid like beings that live to serve creators.\n\n**Plot:**\n\nPlayer starts and is placed outside a small town near a heavily deforested area. Shops are located in a nearby town. Armour, tools, a forge, bank, etc\n\nThe town is overflowing with people(bots from a few players) all running around doing various tasks.\n\nThe player has a small wooden crown, an axe and can chop wood, but this is pointless on its own.\n\nThere is a Guildhall, you can hire bots to work for your faction household. The first one is free.\n\nThere is magic systems in your household you can access to control the preprogrammed tasks of your bots.\n\nThe player can only control so many bots, the player's crown is what decides how many. A Wooden Crown can command 2 bots. Each upgrade growing their power exponentially until they command thousands.\n\n* The player can upgrade their crown at the guildhall. The ranks are: \n * Wood&gt;Bronze&gt;Silver&gt;Gold&gt;Platinum&gt;Diamond&gt;Commander&gt;Leader&gt;Ruler&gt;Lord&gt;King&gt;Deity&gt;God\n\n Each rank the crown gets increasingly more flashy and ridiculous.\n\n---\n\n#Bots\n\n * Bots have the same needs as a player, They require food and sleep. Food is provided free at the guildhall every day at set times.\n		\n * They come preloaded with basic functionalities in a default routine. \n * The default routine is setup by day to day tasks in a messy basic step by step system.\n\n        Wake Up&gt;stand up&gt;walk to door&gt;open door&gt;step forward&gt;turn around&gt;shut door&gt;walk down stairs&gt;walk to armory door&gt; ETC\n\nThe game alerts the player that this is messy and tells the player that they should improve this by creating modules for each task. It prompts the player to follow along with a guide walking them through \ncreating a few for basic things such as; \n\n* Waking up and gearing up in the armor, leaving the house, going to the forest and chopping wood, returning at noon for food, going back to work until sunset, heading to bank and depositing resources into household account, going home to sleep.\n\nOnce the script is complete and the player understands the basics they are on their own to expand further.\n\nThere are many professions like woodcutting, mining, fishing, cooking, Armor/weapon smithing, etc\n	Each Profession can be automated with bots.\n\n#The world\n\n* There is several large towns with unique resources and perks.\n* The player is isolated to a small section of the world with only 2 towns a large forest and a few mines. \n* This area is walled in with a large gate somewhere along the walls.\n * This gate has a very hefty toll to be allowed through. \n * You must upgrade your player's crown from Wooden to Gold in order to be allowed to leave.\n * Beyond the gate needs to meet the players expectations. This should be a jaw dropping realization that the game has only just begun.\n  * ️ ️ ️ ️ ️ ️ ️ ️ ️The player walks through the gate down a dark tunnel with a light at the end. Marching forward with their faithful servants(bots) following alongside.\n \n      The opening is bright, the blinding light fades to reveal they are on top of a large hill overlooking a lush forest a smokey mountain in the distance, a few towns, one relatively close and some further out. There is a stone path leads out in front of them downward into and through the forest towards the nearest town.\n\n---\n\n**Setting:**\n\nMMO, Fantasy, Medieval\n\nThis is a typical fantasy world filled with monsters and mystery.\n\n**Characters:**\n\n* **The Player;** Wields a Crown to command the bots, runs a Faction Household. Works with the GuildHall.\n\n**Gameplay Mechanics:**\n\n* Resources slowly replenish.(If a tree is cut it will respawn within a random amount of time from 15 minutes to an hour or more.)\n\n\n\n**Standout Features:**\n\n* PROGRAMMING BASED MMO?!?!\n\n**Possible Platforms:**\n\n* PC\n\n**Extra Information:**\n\nThis may seem incredibly difficult to run if it existed, but I'll break down how I would do it.\n\nI imagine having all running bots simplified when not being observed.\n\nI'd zone the map into segments, calculate the resources for each segment as any given time.\n\nEmulate a players bot script upon saving and detect efficiency. (how long to get to location, how much resources gathered a minute, etc) Then just pretend it's actually there since we know exactly where it would be at any given time we can make it appear if anyone stumbled upon it.\n\nWhen I player programs a bot script and runs in on thousands of bots its the same server load as running only 1 bot but with 1000x efficiency.\n\nIf a player stumbled into a forest being swarmed by a players bots. The server knows there is 1000 bots cutting trees here and it's maybe 3:00pm into the day. The Forest is mostly deforested based on the bots efficiency at this time so the player sees the front zones of the forest as mostly tree stumps, the army of bots can be seen deeper in and spread out along many trees.\n\nEstimating time to clear an area and only showing them work if you are present.\n\n---\n\nThis idea is mine and I've been adding to it from time to time. \n\nI've drawn inspiration from Minecraft, Zelda, Dwarf fortress, Runescape(and its unfortunate botting situation), Warcraft, Adventure time, A Township Tale, That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime, CIV, SAMP, and many other things.\n\nI imagine the graphics being relatively simplistic polygon geometry with no or limited use of textures.\n\n**How To Credit Me:** Worship me for I am Psyda, the Creator of Creators. I demand a Statue in my honor.\n\nI don't intend to work on this idea right now and have been holding onto it and tweaking it for ages. If you'd like to work with me in the future I like that."
9y8xtd,Multiplayer city builder mmo.. Thing...,"A top down survival mmo, set in a vast wilderness. Players could build they're own towns and communities, populated by NPCs or other players. The town would be ran by a mayor, but Let's say the owner of the towns been ofline for 3 months. Then he would be kicked from rank as owner and players could vote for a new one. Of course the previous mayor could be revoted. Players could become farmers, lumberjacks, start they're own businesses ect. But they would need to buy a house, or land to build in the city. This would have to be aproved by the mayor. There could also be architects, they could only plan out what is to be built. They couldn't actually build to prevent griefing. And builders could place walls and furniture only where the architect designated them. This would Also have to be approved by the mayor. If the town grows large enough there could be more than one mayor. We could also have scientists, people who research stuff to aid in building and better life for other settlers. Some jobs could be done by NPCs and some couldn't. And maybe if enough towns are built nations could form. And a president would have to be elected. He would be in charge of foreign relations and maybe wars, maybe you could lead armies into other nations and take over towns, not actually destroy them, just take them over.\n\nI had this idea in the shower, I don't know what to do with it so here."

So, it may be a little ambitious, but picture this:  \n\n\nYou're standing on nothing, surrounded by stars and galaxies and the general void of space itself. You can point around and try and pick out any constellation visible sort of like a mini dot-to-dot puzzle, where they are will change depending on the time of day/night and the area you're in, so basically the stars will be where they are from your perspective in real time.\n\nOnce you've connected the constellation, it tells you the name, and then almost like a memory, you become the main character of the mythological story that the constellation is based on, and since it's VR it'll be like you really were there and lived through it! It's telling a story that already exists rather than letting the player make their own, so it won't have many choices or much free exploration but there could still be stuff for the player to interact with, plus mythology has plenty of fighting! For some stories the players could be given minor choices, as some myths do have multiple variations.  \n\n\nI'd rather it have a soft colourful animated style, maybe cel-shaded, rather than realistic graphics, I don't know why, I think it would just suit it better and be more aesthetically pleasing."
9y12eh,"""Star Me"" A game that is both a simulator and talent scout","Hi guys, so this game was basically inspired by soundcloud and mmo's.\n\nThe core of the game is you/your sim becoming a famous artist\n\nBasically the game would be like an mmo in that you create you own character, dress them, and earn currency.  The game would require voice input for much of it as it would be played similarly to rock band in that you have to sing on key and on tempo to score higher points.  The reward would be currency that could be spent on aesthetic things for your character, or, you could purchase performance enhancing effects (voice changers, auto tune, plugins/vsts).  \n\nPlayers could compete in ""rap battles"" or sing battles like in pitch perfect against other players or npcs to earn more currency.  I was thinking the battles could take place either as covers of existing songs which could be rated by a computer or ""freestyle battles"" that could be rated by other players.\n\nProduction software has gotten incredibly good in recent years which would allow for the individual performance enhancing effects to be automatically adjusted to the players unique voice.\n\nIf the game grew big enough i imagine that the top players would have legitimate music careers and it would become a way for new artists to build a following such as soundcloud has become\n\nJust an idea anyone have any  thoughts?"

The idea is pretty bad and doesn’t have to follow this exact scenario, but this is how I imagined it. Keep in mind, the idea is that it starts out normal but then escalates and just turns into nonsense.\n(Also, I’m on mobile so sorry if this is all clustered and hard to read)\n\n\nMy idea goes as follows:\nThe game is advertised as a hunting simulator, and that’s it. In the hypothetical trailer for the game, it only shows gameplay of hunting, camping, and fishing along with other outdoor activities. You buy the game and it seems normal for a while. However, on a hunting mission, things start going south. You kill a deer and when you go up to it, it’s all alien looking and just not right. You and your partner get creeped out and head back to camp (it’s night btw). After falling asleep, you hear loud crashes. You exit the tent to see a giant hairy foot that seems like it’s from a giant. You shine your light and the giant is too tall for the light to see, then the giant runs off. This really creeps you out (obviously) so you and your partner decide to head back to town. You arrive at sunrise and the town is destroyed and there’s monsters roaming the streets. After finding that your family is gone from the house, and after having a few spooky encounters with some monsters, you get abducted by an alien with a gangster sounding accent (not sure why I imagined him this way but thought it was funny for some reason) and taken to Area 51. The men there tell you that the source of the monsters comes from an alien ship outside of earth that is spawning portals all over the planet. They said they had enough men to work the computers, but they needed at least three men to go into space and destroy the ship. You, your hunting partner, and the alien (basically this alien is the same race as the bad aliens, but the government promised to give him lots of treasure if he betrayed his people) go into space and attempt to destroy the ship. However, the alien ship teleport themselves and you’re ship far away, somewhere where gravity is way different (some interstellar type shit where time speeds up for them but stays normal on earth) blah blah blah they destroy the ship and then they are stuck in space. They have no idea how to get back to Area 51 (they have no clue that time changed for them, so let’s just say 700 years have passed for earth but for you it’s been like an hour). Just when it looks bad, god himself comes down and picks up their ship and brings them back to earth. God explains that he has been watching, and he explains that when they get back, the world will be a lot different because of the time difference. When they arrive to earth, they see that it’s all futuristic and that apparently they are historical heroes and everyone on earth loves them. \n\nLong story short, the whole story leads up to the punch line when they’re sitting down, and your character says “hey, wanna go hunting?” Then the game ends.\n\nAgain I have no idea if this would even work, because you technically would be lying to the audience because it’s not actually a hunting simulator. The whole point is that you are just playing a normal game, then all of this crazy shit just happens and you’re experiencing it along with the characters because you had no idea what this game was.\n\nMaybe it could be a normal hunting game but this little storyline is triggered through an easter egg where you accidentally eat some psychedelic plant in the woods or something. Anyways, thanks for reading.\n\n"
9xwftp,Simple competative party game like Gang Beasts.,"This is one of those ideas that just popped up in my head from nowhere so there my very well be a game like this already.\n\nI was thinking a very minimalistic competative party game in the style of Nidhogg or Stick Fight TG, where you play in a top down view as a gladiator in a colosseum arena against other players in various game modes, both locally and online.\n\nEvery now and then the audience in the stands may throw a weapon into the arena for players to use like, swords, hammers, pikes and spears with different stats in speed, range and damage.\n\nYou could also make it so that weapons are one or two-hand.\n\nIf you're holding a shortsword you can also hold a shield which protects against one attack, but a pike would be a two-hand weapon.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThere's a lot of different game modes that could be used.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Local**\n\n* Deathmatch, where every player has a set number of lives and the match continues until only one remains.\n\n* Unlimited, where the audience is divided into equal sections of fans corresponding to each players color.\n\nWhen a player gets a kill his section will grow and the killed players section will shrink.\n\nWhen a players section disappears he is eliminated from the match.\n\nThe match goes on until only one remains.\n\n* Wave, where the players fights as a team against wave after wave of CPU controlled slaves, gladiators, tigers and bears.\n\nThe match continues until the whole team is eliminated.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Online**\n\nPlayers now fight in teams of four against other teams.\n\nPlayers in the same team all have a different hue of the same color to tell them apart.\n\nThe game modes are the same as local games except you play co-op against other teams.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nYou could even have a ranking table for online teams."

9xqm25,Need help with ideas for an unique RPG battle system based on mirrors...,"Since last year I have been developing a RPG where both story and some mechanics are based on mirrors. And everything is going perfectly... except that I still can't think of how to create a battle system that uses in some way the concept of ""mirrors"". The thing is, in the game, the mirrors are important, not as objects, but as a concept... the whole game, the characters, the worlds, etc. revolve around ""mirrors"". By the way, I intend to make the system as simple as possible... but based on mirrors. Any idea or suggestion?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nP.S: Sorry if my English is not the best, I'm working on it."
9xq63t,Weapon System for sci-fantasy game,"Alright so I've been planning out this really ambitious sci-fantasy game for months, but I'm a little bit stuck on how getting weapons will work. So far, I have four ideas:\n-Kill enemies and bosses to get weapons like in Destiny\n-Craft weapons with resources that must be gathered like in Warframe\n-Have no preset weapons, just have draftable weapon parts so the players can make their own weapons\n-Kill enemies and bosses to get weapons like in Destiny, but be able to dismantle them for a fairly good chance of getting one or two parts to create custom weapons\n\nWhich of these four do you guys think is the best idea to go with?\n\nBTW, there are Augments (that can be obtained by killing enemies) that can be upgraded and attached to weapons to give them advantages in combat. There are six Augment slots available on weapons.\n\nExample: Augment A can increase a Shotgun's range, while Augment B can increase the Shotgun's damage."
9xpxt4,Team 2D platformer like Overwatch/TF2,"Awesomenauts took MOBAs and made a platformer out of it, so why not do the same thing with the OW/TF2 formula?\n\nMy take is that it would focus on verticality. The attacking team starts at the bottom of the map and the defending team is at the top. Most cooldown abilities would revolve around knockback or mobility. Projectiles will be somewhat less common and shields won't really be a thing. Healing should be somewhat less important than in OW/TF2. 4 players per team.\n\nA possibility is also to not have death at all, but instead focus on knockback and strong stuns. That would be something to experiment with."
9xowex,Survival Game Idea,"Ok, so I had this idea in the shower and it actually seemed like it could be a pretty good game, so I'm putting it here. Also, I am not a game developer but I enjoy writing stories and I have ""game developer"" as a possible career in my future.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy idea is that you start at school, in your class. You are in class with your classmates, and maybe you hear something that no one else hears, either a bell or a scream or I don't know what. But anyways, a few seconds after that, everyone other than you disappears, and you are alone in the school. And the twist is that, while you can't see anyone, people can see you. They can't interact with you, but they can hear and they can see you. You, on the other hand, can do neither. You have the pretense that you are completely alone, and then you need to spend the next 30 minutes trying to not get killed by a monster that is in the school. I am thinking that you would have two ways of seeing it, the one you see while playing and the replay. The replay would show you from the point of view of everyone else, which means that you (the player) can see everyone including your character, *except for the monster*. And when you interact with objects in this ""other world"", they make a copy of themselves, or a ""ghost"". A version of them that the character can interact with and that the other people couldn't, so you could say throw a chair to slow down the monster and not hurt any of your classmates. I think that the game would be permadeath, and that when the character dies they are brought back into the normal world and depending on their position they might phase with other objects, including people. After that, you would take the place of the entity choosing people to go into this ""other world"". You would select a person from that school (all of them randomly generated) and try to survive with them. The game would be over once you have managed to survive for the whole 30 minutes and you would be brought back alive (however you could get unfortunately phased into an object or person)."
9xnzsb,Tycoon type game idea,"Hey all\n\nThe idea I have is a Takeshi castle game but you have to operate it like a tycoon /a business.\nThe basic works can be like RCT2.\nHave the commerce, attractions building.

9xjm9v,"A cyber-noir game about fast-travel, in which you track down and kill innocent ""outlaws"" who survived teleportation.","The game takes place in a future in which teleportation booths are ubiquitous. **Fast-travel using these is central to the plot and to the gameplay.** Not just the player can fast-travel, but so can NPCs. They use it to get to work, to travel for vacation, to take their lunch break in Tokyo, etc. Society has accepted teleportation booths.\n\n#### It's no secret: Teleportation booths clone you and then kill you.\n\nThe population has generally come to accept this. *You* always feel like *you* when you come out of the other side, after all. Unfortunately, teleportation booths do have a slim failure rate. Once in a while, the booths will fail to destroy the original. These survivors are disavowed by society and declared outside of the protection of law.\n\nThis is where you come in. You play a marshal who is tasked with tracking down and eliminating these [outlaws.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlaw)\n\nFor each case you'll visit their home and workplace for clues to where they may be hiding. You'll interview relatives, colleagues, aquaintances *and even the rightful* clone himself/herself. The outlaw will also ping on a map if they were tagged by a nearby biometric scanner. Each case is like a detective mystery that may end in a confrontation or gunfight.\n\n### Fast-Travel as a Gameplay Mechanic\n\nThe basic game idea came from wondering, ""what if fast-travel wasn't just a small gameplay feature, but instead was the core mechanic of a game?""\n\nThe game world would be about as large as the several city hubs in recent Deus Ex games, just large enough to make fast-travel useful at walking speed (there's no need for cars in this future). Everyone can fast travel *except outlaws* since the network has already flagged them. The rightful clones of the outlaws are also affected since there's no way to tell them apart.\n\nThis is important because any time an outlaw is pinged on the map, it means they *have* to be within a certain radius (based on time and walking speed). On the other hand, you can zip all over the place to check nearby scanners or to outmaneuver your target.\n\nIt's so useful to you that it would be a shame if—in the final act of the game—a teleporter malfunctioned on you and now you become the hunted."

9xheyz,Chao Garden Inspired - Pet Raising Exploration Game Idea,"Hi Everybody!\n\nI'm a game designer with a simple idea inspired by Sonic Adventure 2's Chao garden. I decided to play Sonic adventure 2 after 15 years and it got me hooked to the Chao garden which got me thinking, what if the concept of the Chao garden was expanded on? I love the idea of raising ""pets"" and unlocking new areas to explore. So with that being said here's the idea for a game.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSomething similar to the Chao garden where you raise some sort of creature/ pet, and having them change appearance based on how you raise them. However it would also be really neat to have some small areas to explore which you can find special eggs or areas to have your pets roam around it. One example from a game that did this really well was Slime Rancher, however in this concept your pets would have more freedom and wouldn't be stuffed in a cage with horrible living conditions and capitalizing on their droppings. Each of these pets would have a purpose and each one would feel unique!\n\nIt would also be really cool if somehow these pets could help you unlock special areas. For instance if they could have some sort of element to them and one with a fire element could melt the pathway to an icy area which contains an ice egg and boom! Ice pet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo the basic idea would pretty much be a pet raising simulator with some exploration. If you're interested in the work I've made in the past you can check out my website at [www.machimera.com](https://www.machimera.com)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for listening! Let me know what you think.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\-Machimera"

9x8f7c,A demolition-derby racing game where your parts keep breaking and you have to steal parts from other racers... mid-race.,"Junker GP.\n\nEvery racecar is a lemon. Every car part threatens to break on you in the middle of the race. Every racecar has a pit crew *in the car* that dogpiles out of the windows to steal parts from adjacent cars... also in the middle of the race.\n\n****\n\nThe HUD has a diagram of all your vital car parts (the four wheels, axels, radiator, engine, transmission, gas tank, etc.) and how close they are to breaking. As your car takes damage, along with regular wear and tear, the parts start to break on you.\n\nAt any point, like a mini-RTS, you can order your in-car pit crew to start repairing the vehicle so long as you have the necessary parts and scraps. *Let's not ask how they're doing it while the car is running; let's just chalk this up to videogame logic.* But if you have the budget, it'd be comedy gold to animate this repair.\n\nTo steal parts from other cars, you order as many crewmen you have available to cram out of the side windows. You then pull up to another vehicle on that side. Your crew will immediately engage in breaking random parts off from the other car. However, you can also direct specific crew members to target specific parts using the same mini-RTS interface.\n\nThe other cars will have their own in-car pit crew to defend themselves. Opposing crewmen will slap-fight in pairs, so you'll either need to focus more of your crew to this task than the other car, or direct them to focus on stealing (which will open you up to getting parts stolen too).\n\nDon't forget, you're driving throughout all this. It goes without saying that you don't want to be way ahead of the pack in this type of racing game, or else you won't have parts to steal."

9x0cxi,The psychology of a city,"You, and 7 others live a unique life. You communicate with the city in very non traditional ways. Through messages on vehicles, posters, songs blasting through speakers, or just by a group of people passing by you, you deliver the required information\n\nApart from that, you've been given a range of realities. One comes with the most privileges and least problems, one comes with the most problems and least privileges. And there's a host of realities in between.\n\nOne Saturday, you decide to get together, but you don't know where the others are. You start from different locations in the city, with instructions for where to go and where to meet, being delivered by the city in the said ways. But there's a catch, only half the people want you to meet, the other half, don't.\n\nThose who want you to meet tell you where to go, makes your task easy, and those who don't, confuse you as much as  possible. They even try not to let you go where you wanna. Both the groups have their fun, sledging and trash talk goes.\n\nWhen the path of two people intersect, they are removed from the game, and if it is fun, new players join. \n\nThe game is designed with ethical concerns, if the player can't take it, it is stopped. And with iterations, the game can be improved.\n\nIt answers one aspect of a psychology of a city, to what extent do the people of a city like to have fun. \n\nSuggestions are welcome."

9ww7wk,Hall Monitor,"One of my favorite games is Papers Please, where the premise is pretty much people come through the line at an immigration checkpoint and give you papers, and you have to see if they have all the valid documents. My game idea is similar in the primary mechanic, but more abstract when it comes to the setting.\n\nYour job is to patrol the school for kids that aren't supposed to be in the hall. On your first day, you're only chosen to monitor one hallway. As the game progresses, administration gives you more of the school to monitor, but since you have more work you can either a) be allowed to miss more kids, as you can't be everywhere, or b) set up other kids as posts to help you monitor the school. The game takes place over a set amount of time (30 days/ levels, maybe more)\n\nOnce you find a kid in the hall, you interrogate them, they give you a hall pass (each classroom has a different hall pass, and you have to see if its valid or not, this is the primary inspiration from Papers Please). If they have a valid pass, great. If not, you can write them up, or they may run, and you have to chase them before they go inside the bathroom, their classroom, etc. Chasing them down could lead to not interrogating other kids in the hall. Some kids may give you a sob story, or have a ""valid"" excuse as to why they don't need a pass. Whether or not you believe them is up to you. However, if you miss a kid, or let one go that shouldn't be let go, a teacher may come out of a classroom and tell you that they never get their permission, getting you in trouble. So, you have to predict certain teachers' behavior as you progress (some may not care, some are very very strict).\n\nThere can also be an overarching story in the game. Maybe there is a clique in the school that tries to abuse your powers, either through threats or bribes to make sure they don't get tickets. Whether or not you let them operate is your choice.\n\nTell me what you think, typing it all out makes it sound a lot like Papers Please but maybe that's just because it's inspired off of it. Hopefully I added something more that isn't just a reskin of that game."
9wv2y4,"Half shooter, half racer, half puzzle solving","The game will start  you in a random maze with 49 other people. Your goal is to find you way out of the maze. You also fight off zombies along the way. If you kill a zombie they might give you a hint how to beat the maze. If you die by the zombie, it starts you at the beginning again. After the first person beats the maze a 30 second timer starts for the other people. If they don't make it on time, they die. After that you all spawn in cars. Then a down hill race will starts with boosts and traps and missiles. If you crash or blow up, you wait 3 seconds, then spawn in the place you die. After teh first person finishes, a 10 second timer starts and if you don't make it in time, you die. The based on your finishing order, you can get an extra 10 seconds to spawn in and to set up. All alive players get pistols with weapons hidden on the map. Then after everyone spawns in, you fight off dead players who have pistols. The final person who survives wins.

Would be glad if you could give me some feedback on it ;)\n\nThe game is about you, waking up with no memery whatsoever, and you get told that you have xx days left to live. You begin exploring the world, a little city trying to find clues about yourself, who you are and why someone wants to kill you. The world is probably set in a magic world in medieval times. There is also a lot of NPC in the game, you can talk with them, or you can just kill them, *everything is up to you.* As the days pass, the killer shows up and kills you if you haven't figured out the plot, and then you need to restart. Restarting is completely encouraged, as i would like to think it as a part of the game. For every game you play you figure out more and more about the plot.\n\nNow i just need the main idea for the plot and why someone is trying to kill you.

a04fhg,Discord server for an open game dev community?,"Hello everyone,\n\nI'm setting up a Discord server for a game dev community. The idea behind it is that anyone can come up with an idea, the community members vote on the ideas, and if something is popular enough, we set up a gitlab project (for a group that involves the community members) and begin the development process. This way, anyone would be able to contribute to any community project in any way they want. I have some rough ideas for project management and processes.\n\nThis whole thing started because I'd often rather just jump into work than worry about design or entertain my endless feature creep tendencies. People who don't know game dev but have ideas could gain some insight into the process and get some experience, people who have some but not all game dev skills could get support and aid from others, and the mythical creatures who know all about game dev could... Pass on some knowledge? Be amused? I think this could be fun, and a good opportunity for people of all skill levels to learn and improve.\n\nBefore I launch this thing, I would be really grateful to hear constructive opinions and ideas. Let's imagine for a second that this is not completely naive and bound to flop.\n\nWhat would you like to see happen there? What do you think would keep this community running?

a02tyu,Game about the life of a web developer (digital &amp; analog card game),"I'm a software engineer and I really enjoy to play some simple and fun games with my friends every now and then, nothing fancy but kind of in the style of Exploding Kittens.\n\nFrom this background I've come up with the idea of representing the ultimate stigma around software engineering and the frustrations that come with it through a simple, fun yet interesting game. I think everyone has heard of programmers getting frustrated about the requirements of their customers and if they haven't, it's pretty funny to hear or learn about it I think. An example:\n\n&gt;Manager asks for a feature that will make one of his customers very happy.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Programmer thinks about it and tells him it will take him 3 months to implement it.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Manager says he should finish it in 2 weeks.\n\nAt this point, the game could either be fully digital or a hybrid between a digital game and a analog card game. The idea is as follows: all people are developers playing the same scenario of a manager asking for some ridiculous looking website and gives you an estimate about how long you have to finish it. In your hand are cards that can either buff the progress of your site or hinder others. The goal is simple, get as close to the intended product as possible within the time frame.\n\nOptions for expanding on this idea would be to add some programming in it so people can learn programming and/or just enjoy programming some wacky things while hindering others and putting out fires that others have made in their code with nasty debuffs.\n\nI'd love to hear what you think and where you think the idea could use some improvement. Feel free to be critical!"
a02ri8,Ideas to improve my game idea.,"Hello everyone.   \nI'm a mobile game developer and have an idea to make a open-world, survival game with a couple of elements. I bought some assets and made some of my own. Got a lot of code and designs but I'm not sure how exactly to merge them together.  Let me start with what I have at the moment and put it into a list.  \n1. A map that can be customised which is for everyone to play together. Lets say a server, something like an open world game. It can be played by every device together. Android, iOS, Web, Mac, PC(steam, etc..) or consoles. My main priority is mobile at the moment, all the game logic and user interaction is made for mobile(Android and iOS).  \n2. Dragons, lots of dragons i bought and made. Small ones, big ones, hunderds of animations. Dragons can be the main characters, the main enemies or the NPCs. I have some characters too, around 6 humans with different armor and skills.  \n3. RTS/RPG elements. Skills, Items, Guils, Chat list, etc.. I made an Open server Tower Defence with these assets that has everything I spoke about except for the dragons. Here is a demo of it on Android - [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nedi.ummorpgtd&amp;hl=en](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nedi.ummorpgtd&amp;hl=en).  \n\n\nMy ideas were the following. -   \n1. Continue and make a open world tower defence where everyone works to fight with the common enemy and they join a different server to get more powerful and farm gear and stuff. All work together.  \n2. Make some sort of battle royale, where everyone spawns at different places and start fighting each other only to get stronger and stronger. You can loot items from other players or kill monsters randomly spawned on the map.\n\n3. Start to create different server at interval of 10 or 20 people and make them do something together. Battle royale genre or fight together a boss or something.   \n\n\nI'm struggling to make a successfull game from a lot of time now. I have around 15 games in the mobile world. \n\nIf you can help me think of an idea that is good at this moment for the mobile world or something that sounds cool with what I got at the moment, I would add a character named after you in your tribute and let it be and NPC in my world for you to be there forever inside it.

9zxj70,A Cthulhu-based Horror RPG,"Since we all know valve will never release Portal 3, I thought I’d make something similar to Portal 1 (don’t worry no puzzle solving nor portals mixing wit Cthulhu) since the orange box contains my favourite games and I don’t want that feeling to be squashed out by all these shooter games (yes I know tf2 and half life are shooters especially tf2 but they’re still wacky and hilarious, and they just have that ~~nostalgia and romanticising the past~~ great feeling to them)\n\nAlso I’d like to give Extra Credits credit (ba-dum tssssh) for inspiring me to make this with their ‘Why horror games do Cthulhu wrong’ video (yup that’s the theme, now watch me disregard everything they say in that video)\n\n#**Gameplay:**\n\nThis would be an semi-open world RPG similar to Skyrim or Fallout (I’m not sure about Fallout I never played it). It would start with no cutscenes to get you in on what the world is supposed to be like, but immediately throw you into a time restricted challenge to get you awake up and proper. \n\nYou would rapidly flit between characters mentioned in the original story, and some other random people.\n\nYou would accomplish stuff like you’d expect in real life but occasionally get references to Cthulhu or other parts of the mythos which, when completed, would swap to a new character.\n\nThis is probably quite controversial, but this game would be like Bendy and the Ink Machine where the gameplay itself is extremely lacking but it’s (hopefully) made up for in story.\n\n#**Story:**\n\nThis is not really story, but more on theme, and this generally echoes the video but more detailed maybe? (I’m still new at this) \n\nWhile doing your everyday tasks, you would see random occurrences and weird things that you might associate with LSD. An example I have in mind is someone outside their house and a random tentacle comes up behind them and taps their shoulder. The man says he’ll be there in a minute and you see the man getting dragged into the earth before your character turning away sharply. If you choose to look back you see the same man leaving for work but the soil is still displaced like it actually happened.\n\nMystery would be a core element in the game, but not in the traditional large sense. It would be in these tiny occurrences, that seem like they have no overall meaning to the plot unless they’re put together.\n\nContradiction would also be a large part of the game, in my mind there are two lines. You have one line which leads into no contradiction, then the other line would be the border between contradiction and making no sense. If I had to choose I’d like this game straddling the latter. A big part would be making you question everything about this game, such as:\n\n“What’s the story?”\n\n“What’s the meaning of &lt;thing&gt;”\n\n“What *********************** thought it was a good idea to make this game? EA?” (Don’t worry I don’t think EA has the rights. &lt;looks at Star Wars Battlefront 2&gt; Those bastards.”\n\nI have multiple endings in mind, but none of them would be clearly illustrated as being the real or fake endings. I want there to be a sizeable number of endings, like 4 or 5. I also want the concept of decision making in relation to endings being flipped on its head, with things that you would assume being important to the story having little to no impact and things that you would think are just little speech changes or side quest things *sometimes* make an impact. Maybe that Undertale thing where you have this value when you create a new game and the events can be altered based on that but I want to keep it simple for now.\n\nI’m keeping it as vague as I think I can in hopes of someone who tries to make this have freedom and people reading this to imagine their own thing, suggesting it, then ~~brutally plagiarising it~~. Also maybe I was thinking,of adding other entities from the Mythos, but like I said before I want to keep it simple.\n\nFeedback would be appreciated and remember, &lt;some random Cthulhu quote&gt;\n\n\n\nThanks for reading!

9zu087,Does anyone have Any ideas?,Me and some friends are working on a game about a girl lost in the woods with monsters. When she dies I want a little short cutscene of her dying and saying something as she dies. I dont have any ideas on what she should say does anyone else? It doesnt need to be specific on what killed her
9zth2z,Nickelodeon VS Cartoon Network Brawler,"TL;DR- Super Smash Brothers But with Cartoon characters from our childhood, some art post in r/gaming gave me the idea. \n\nMuch to the chagrin of Sony and Microsoft consumers alike there’s yet to really be any competent Smash Brothers analog for the likes of us, and I believe that’s because Nintendo has unique and interesting character design in the bag and so they have essentially a limitless roster to pull from, and they nailed the feel of the controls and have just refined it ever since. Where as whenever someone’s tried to release a Smash-like game on other consoles the rosters are pathetic even if the gameplay is passable, there’s like 8 characters to choose from. So I propose they ditch trying to outright copy Smash Brothers by using characters from the consoles most notable games, and instead outright copy Smash Brothers with characters from Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon.\n\nBasically the story is it’s one of those two universe Smash (pun intended) into each other tales, where the inhabitants at first don’t get along and fight each other, then they realize who the real enemy is, join together, defeat the evil and set their worlds back to the way they were. The humor should break the fourth wall pretty often, with the characters even referencing how similar the game is to Smash Brothers without actually saying it outright. \n\nAs much as you’ll be fighting other cartoon characters there’s more common generic enemies you’ll have to fight as well like in the Smash Bros story mode, and there will be bosses to fight that unlock as playable characters and one of them absolutely needs to be two ladies called “The Mega Squish Sisters”.  Sounds a little pornographic I know, but I mean all the cartoons we watched as kids had hidden adult themes in them anyway right? \n\nIt should focus on the classics in terms of the roster but I see no reason to not to include more recent additions to the Networks in the roster, or maybe have some of them as like the assist trophies or something who knows. \n\nTaking a page from Smash Brothers ultimate, everyone has a special move, unlike ultimate though it’s not a pick up. It’s determined by a points system, knocking people out of the map earns points, taking damage when you’ve got a really high damage percentage already, coming back from a certain distance and landing back on the map, and string together attacks within a certain amount of time all earn you points, once you’ve earned enough you can use your ultimate ability. \n\nSome character examples would be:\n\nSpongebob: he’s essentially like the Mario of the Nickelodeon side, easy all rounder character with pretty simple moves. His ultimate is he shows everyone the bubble blowing technique, and blows a huge bubble that captures people inside and then floats away with them trapped. \n\nFinn: He’s essentially Link, he uses his sword and lots of battle cries, he can also send Nestor out to zoom forward and explode on contact with another player, his special move is he grows out his huge grass arm and grabs someone slamming them down dealing massive damage to them while potentially knocking anyone caught under his arm out of the map.\n\nDexter: small and quick, when he moves around the map it’s like the show, his feet scurry, but his head remains level, all of his attacks utilize some kind of tech, he’s kind of like Solid Snake in that way. His ultimate is equipping that gundam looking rocket suit he makes in of the episodes, you fly around shooting rockets and laughing maniacally.\n\nZim: he’s one of those tricky characters that transforms kinda like Zelda, you can be on your feet or turn on your spider legged backpack so when people attack low or do slide attacks they miss, your attacks change and gain more range, but you’re easier to launch off the map. His ultimate is everything freezes he pulls out a remote while laughing maniacally and presses the button, a red eyed GIR appears and starts attacking everyone, the catch is that randomly sometimes GIR will show up with green eyes and do nothing but absorb attacks from any source, potentially saving you, but also potentially and more likely getting in the way.\n\nSteven Universe: uses his shield for lots of ranged attacks and defense, and floats around sort of like Peach does. His ultimate is the camera zooms in on him while he rises into the air, rose quartz energy flowing all around him then it quick zooms on his face when turns around suddenly to show a super Anime looking face, his eyes all sparkly, and then everything turns pink except for the other players, you can fly for a little bit and whenever you grab someone you bubble them and make them disappear. Only lasts for like 5s and the bubbling animation takes like 2s so realistically you can only get like two people. \n\nK.O.: pretty predictable fighting style, as in you can guess how he fights not like his moves are super telegraphed or anything. He can shoot power fists, and for his ultimate he turns into Turbo K.O.\n\nEduardo: Typical big guy stuff, lots of attacks that have you charging across the map, slam attacks and the like. His ultimate is he sees a spider on his shoulder and freaks out, you lose control of the character while he runs around all over the map at high speeds screaming his head off. While screaming he’s impervious to damage and can run up walls. Lasts for 4s.\n\nI mean it’s a simple enough idea, just parody a a wildly successful game with characters everyone misses or will miss (RIP Adventure Time), it’d just take butt loads of commitment and as much free reign as possible on the developers part. Though I imagine that’d be difficult considering how much licensing would be necessary. It would have to be marketed to the two networks as like the ultimate advertisement/nostalgia trip, and get them to be too blinded by dollar signs to interfere with the making of the game. Cause yeah this game sounds like it’d be fun as all hell, but it could very easily be over-managed into a boring mess of a game not even fit for a daycare center. Still it’s fun to dream.\n"
9zspn3,Harem Anime: The Game,"In this game, one player would be ""The Protagonist"" who the rest of the players, being the members of the Harem. The goal of these Harem members as to be chosen as The Protagonist's soul mate. At the end of the game, the Protagonist gets to pick 1 out of the 3 people with the highest hearts to become soul mates with, causing them to win. \n\nAt the beginning of the game, the Protagonist picks their favorite things and gets a random personality. Each of the Harem members get a random role in the harem. These roles match typical Harem anime archetypes, such as the Tsundere and the Dendere. Some roles would be more out of the box, however, such as the Magical Girl or Fish-Out-of-Water (Girl from another world). These roles are secret.\n\nThe game would take place throughout multiple days. Each day begins with a talking phase, where everyone speaks to each other, a secret exchange, where players send secret notes to each other containing information about their roles, and an event. By doing things in events that matches the Protagonist's favorites and personality, Hearts can be gained. Only the Protagonist can see how many hearts each player has gotten. Then, an afterschool phase begins, where Harem members can preform secret actions or send a confession to the Protagonist.\n\nEach Harem role provides special actions and abilities. For example, the Childhood Friend begins the game with extra hearts and knows the Protagonist's favorites and personality, but has difficulty gaining more hearts due to the friendzone.\n\nIf a player decides to send a confession to the Protagonist, then the Protagonist will receive it during the next Afterschool segment. If the sender's hearts are too low, it will be instantly rejected. If the sender has the highest hearts, it will be instantly accepted. Otherwise, the Protagonist gets to chose to accept it and make the sender their soulmate, or reject them. If someone is rejected, they become Heartbroken, and lose the game, becoming unable to participate for the rest of the game. Confessions cannot be sent until the 3rd Afterschool segment.\n\nNow you may be thinking, ""So the Protagonist always wins? That's dumb."" Well, there are 2 special roles that prevent this. The Yandere and the Overprotective Family Member.\n\nThere is always one Yandere and each game, and there can be more if there are more players. If the Yandere becomes the soulmate, she wins, but the Protagonist loses. The Yandere is able to kill people if they get 2 positive reactions from the Protagonist 2 days in a row. Additionally, she can also stalk people to gain information. The Yandere will kill herself if she is rejected, instead of becoming heartbroken. If she stalks someone while they are writing a confession, she automatically kills them. She can't kill 2 days in a row.\n\nThere is always one Overprotective Family Member in each game, and there can be more if there are more players. The Overprotective Family Member knows all the Protagonist's favorites and personality type. This role does not gain hearts. This role's goal is to ensure that all the other player's hearts are too low to become a soulmate with the Protagonist. They can achieve this by sabotaging and criticize people, causing them to lose hearts with the Protagonist. Once per game, they can fake a rejection letter, causing instant heartbreak. They cannot do this until the 4th afterschool segment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, what do you all think?"
9zsga1,A game specifically about being a wizard/witch,"I know there are a good handful of games that have magic, but the only ones that focus on it seem to be borderline first person shooters.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat I'm thinking of is something more research based which still lets you fight when needed. The idea is for every single spell, utility, ritual, potion, etc to be something you discovered/ crafted/ summoned.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSay you're a witch that lives in a swamp. You start out with nothing but by running into a magic tree and maybe gathering a few herbs/ killing a magical beast, you craft your first wand. As you explore the world you might discover ancient texts or something which lets you learn levitation. From there you might make your house and start researching properly. One of the things you could research is different wand/staff types which enhance a style of play.   \n\n\nThe gameplay would be about researching magic stuff and exploring to gather ingredients/ discover new spells/ perform rituals. As an example, maybe if you learn healing spells/alchemy and help a nearby village, you start getting paid and gain a good reputation. Maybe adventurers come to you to buy potions/ enchant weapons and in return you can ask them to give you a certain item they they'll get if they succeed in their adventure. IE: If they're slaying a lightning dragon you ask them to bring you back scales so you can create lightning related things like a lightning spell, or resistance potion, or enchantment to make a lightning weapon. If you REALLY want them to succeed maybe you can join them for that adventure. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat you learn would depend on what adventures/ research you decide to partake in. You don't just say ""I wanna be a pyromancer."" If you wanted fire-related spells/potions/items then you'd explore a fire related area like a hell dimension, volcano, etc. Because of this one could specialize, but it wouldn't be through throwing skill points at different trees, it would be through discovering different things at different areas. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe spells would be very unique and not just a different flavor of fireball. Of coarse there would be a fireball, but also utility stuff like flying/nullifying fall damage with air magic, or freezing with ice magic. There'd be some necromancy, illusion, mind control, etc. This would make combat much more creative and fun. Also, I think it would be best if things weren't number based but like Magic Maker/ Wizard of Legend where the spells just work. Of coarse there would be enemies and environments where certain types of magic are more viable than others but everything should be usable to an extent. For example: if you're exploring a cave, fire would be much more effective because of lighting and closed space. If you're out in the open, air magic might be more viable for mobility. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally: I think there should be different main methods to progress. You should do some combination of methods but specialization should be key. What comes to mind is:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\-Making your own magic base/tower and having it be a hub for teleporting to other dimensions, farming reagents, exploration, and research. After enough research maybe you can make familiars gather basic ingredients for you and explore. Through enough research/trial and error you should be able to eventually create more powerful things. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\-Becoming a royal magician for a kingdom and get the majority of your resources through conquering/ trading. This could give you trade routes access to all the magical research that kingdom has/gains. This is the more social way of getting new potions/items.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\-Join a guild and help adventurers explore obscure areas/ gather cool items that help you research. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know this is pretty broad but I'm shooting for a full magic experience with rewards research, adventure, and/or trading/conquering. Every spell and item would be gained through a decent process and would be very valuable depending on your play style. The closest I can think of is the minecraft mod ""Thaumcraft"". I think a game with this level of detail but maybe not as confusing as minecraft mods would be amazing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;"
9zrx6u,"PvP, turn-based strategy, team management game based on Red Rover (Blood Bowl 2 ish)","Very similar to Blood Bowl 1 and 2, but is stripped down (red rover compared to american football).\n\nGame play is divided into 2 different parts. \n\nManaging your team/rooster, leveling them up, different PLAYER skill stats (speed, offense, defense, link strength, special, etc) and different TEAM skill trees options (races, special activated skills in game, passive skill sets, etc).\n\nQueing up for a quick PvP match.

9zr36q,First Person Kingdom Builder,"Okay so im not the best at making games but this type of game is something ive always wanted to play but nothing good has ever come of the genre.\n\n     If you have ever heard of the kingdom defense RTS game called (Kingdoms and Castles) you'd get the idea of what kind of kingdom builder I have in mind, fully custom areas to build and you act as the ruler of your area and your advisors etc, would tell you of issues and what not. Take this idea make the graphics realistic (witcher 3/Skyrim style if I may compare), and make it to where when your done building areas of your kingdom you can go into a first person mode where the entire area is populated and you can interact with randomly generated NPCs. Whether they are shop owners blacksmiths, Lords, or whatever else you have, you can talk to them, order them around, make your guards arrest them upon accusation of treason, everything. \n     It would be cool to have a couple modes of this game where singleplayer would have a story mode like all games of the sort, but also a survival mode where your given a pre built kingdom and you must do your best at managing and defending it as you can until either your overthrown or killed in an invasion. These overthrowing instances, would depend on your standing of you population, bad popularity would raise the risk of a raiding party appearing at your door at any moment, while good popularity might grow your city, increase happiness, and allow for you to have kingdom wide events and parties to keep it that way. \n     Invasions would be characters like Barbarians or even other players (like how dark souls does it.), that would appear near your kingdom and you would be informed via courier (which can be killed before he informs you if you have a low popularity as spies might become a problem). if your invaded you can use your existing army (if you built one up) to defend or you can surrender and save the lives of your people but you will be seen as a coward and may be executed or exiled making you lose your kingdom and have to restart, or you can propose a peace treaty via gifts or loyalty to the invading party if they are too strong, allowing you to have an ally that will help when you invade others or get invaded yourself again. This can span many ways and creates a diverse and always different way to play the game.\n     Going from build mode to first person mode would be seamless and work like you were going from 3rd person to 1st person via the F keys in any other games. but just build mode would be zoomed WAY out as your character is not the size of a mountain... your kingdom is. In build mode you can utilize your resources gathered by your citizens to build anything. some resources may only be made if you have certain buildings. For example, you may need Iron or steel to create wall reinforcements and better weapons and armor for you and your army. But until you have a blacksmith that can create the metal and forge the weapons and armor you may not be able to upgrade your items. So there will be a bit of a search for resources to get your upgrades in order.\n     Build mode, aside from being used to build up your kingdom can also be used to quickly look at your diplomatic list. while in build mode though your character does not move and is vulnerable to attacks although the chances do not raise, it stays in line with how well respected you are by your advisors or population. But that doesn't mean you can't be invaded while in build mode because it does not pause the game.\n     First person mode is quite simple, you can do actual first person while walking around or you can go actual third person depending on what you like best, it will not affect anything. While in first person, you will be able to go anywhere even just leave the city although that can be dangerous there further away from your castle you go but not by much. In this mode though, you won't be able to see your active resource count any statistics in the UI, this is because to keep realism you will always have a VERY killable advisor at your side. He/she can be asked to tell you certain statistics and they will do so at command. BUT, they are buyable, meaning they can be bought off to tell you slight lies if your standing isn't so good. (chances of lies vary, but are unlikely to happen constantly, unless you really wanna be a bad ruler) but this advisor can be told to stay or come with you so you have a choice of whether you need the info while exploring or not.\n     While in first person mode you can also talk to people like I mentioned before. your citizens will be randomly generated and settings can be changed to have as much variations in your citizens depending on how good of a pc you have. (this is just aesthetics though, as voice lines can vary depending on the npc is doing) You can make unexpected entrances at bath houses, have random people taken off the streets and punished for something you didn't appreciate, you can order food at local shops or restaurants, or you can just throw money around, because who doesn't like a generous ruler once in a while? This all depends on who you take with you on your excursions around town though, if just your advisor, you can't arrest anyone, or fight anyone and your also very open to attacks from civilians. But you can choose to take guards with you, no exact max number of guards is in my head right now, but let's just say you choose to take 50 guards to follow you around at all times. this will give you a massive advantage over any assassination attempts and will allow you to arrest anyone and do anything to your civilians given you have the power to do so. (options of what you can do in town vary depending on who you take with you is what im getting at) But The idea of taking lots of guards with you into town can also lower your citizens moral because they might see it as a ""flaunting your power"" thing so if you'd like to have many guards in town you can play guard posts or even have a yearly military parade. (like 4th of july or whatever other countries do in today's time)\n     I Apologise for any inconsistent organization in this game Idea explanation but just take the gist of each idea and comment on them as you see fit. Id love to see other ideas for this type of game too! Thanks!"

9zlrq0,"In the Oasis Kingdom, you can be a king, recruit an army and control castles."," \n\n[https://twitter.com/F4Code](https://twitter.com/F4Code)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the Oasis Kingdom, you can be a king, recruit an army and control castles.\n\ncheck out the game : [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.AlexSW.WarTB](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.AlexSW.WarTB)\n\nIntro\n\nMore than ten unique parts including forest, desert, volcano and more. Each section having multiple castles/buildings to fight over and conquer. There will be challenging battles that will require you to think and plan strategies for each of them. When a soldier dies it’s permanent while you can recruit more you need to be a good commander because your funds are limited. Conquer all the castles on a map to unlock the boss battle and move on to the next map. The Oasis Kingdom is a strategy game with an open map where the player can roam around, attack enemies and siege castles. Battles are turned based with the option to make them automatic.\n\nCharacters\n\nEach character will have different stats such as Hit points, attack range, attack factor, defense factor, movement points, speed, and action points (per turn). This stats will be different depending on the character, for example, a warrior with a shield will have high hit points and defense while a ranger will have a high range, high attack and low defense &amp; hit points. Current controllable characters: warrior, ranger, horseman, and spear-warrior.\n\nTerrain and Levels\n\nThere will be at least ten sections each with more than two conquerable buildings. The terrain will be different for each of them, on some rangers characters will have cover and the advantage while in others. In some instances, the terrain will be interactive and even while changing. In the forest, you will see medieval castles, while in the desert you can see the pyramids. In addition, there will be a secret (easter egg) section.\n\nInventory/Unit System\n\nYou will be able to recruit different units with different skills using gold. You gain gold by defeating enemies and controlling castles. Its permanent death, meaning when a unit dies you will lose it. The difficulty also increases the more castles you own\n\nHeroes - coming soon\n\nThe player will have the ability to pick a hero. These are customizable characters that will have the ability to level up and you will decide how to increase its attributes. In addition, they will have additional skills to power up your army.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nwhat do YOU think?"
9zhcqq,Dark Burnout/Cars crossover,"So basically this is just a dumb idea that I laughed at cause I’m fucked up, but essentially it’s the same gameplay model of say Burnout Paradise, open world driving focused on lots of stunts and races, and those takedown races where you need to crash into as many people as possible to win. But there’s one main difference.\n\nThe art style is very much like Pixar’s Cars, all the vehicles are anthropomorphic, with big cartoony eyes and smiles, all the colors are bright and happy pastels and shit, and then when you crash into stuff everything goes black and white except for the cars involved in the collision and as long as you’re all battered and broken everything else stays in black and white with heavy metal music blaring in the background. When you wreck cars it’s like a Mortal Kombat Fatality, it goes into X-Ray mode and you see the weird cartoonish car skeleton inside just get all fucked to hell. Instead of blood it’s like oil starts spurting everywhere so it’s even more gory and messed up. But whenever you’re not like murdering each other on the road it’s all Pixar in tone, with like cheerful music, imagine stuff like Here Comes The Sun by The Beatles, though obviously not that because duh, but just imagine that tone suddenly changing over to some scream-o and death metal while cartoon cars just get horribly mangled. \n\nAlso if it’s an online game I had an idea where you can wreck so bad you can’t move, if that happens your car character just sits there slumped, screaming in agony with no music playing, the entire time he’s just screaming for you to kill him. You can self destruct, or you can just sit there, begging any passing car to end your misery, NPC cars will just look away and hurry by, but other players will actually get points if they boost into you and destroy you. It’ll be all “MERCY KILLER!!!” It absolutely needs a Mortal Kombat-like announcer with a really intense voice shouting the names of the different types of special stuff you can do, only on occasion as someone screaming about every takedown would get tiresome. \n\nBut that’s basically it, just my gimmicky fucked up take on the arcade driving genre hahah\n\n"

9z6pdz,Locations in Arizona that I thought would make for great maps in a Battlefield Styled FPS,"I'm from Arizona. It may be highly temperature sensitive, but it's still a nice place considering it's the home of the Grand Canyon, Mesh Front Doors, and Bad Dragon.\n\nI am also an aspiring game dev, and as such, I thought of multiple locations within Arizona state that if were put into a Battlefield like FPS, they would be pretty fun.\n\n**This is the list I came up with:**\n\nDowntown Phoenix\n\nLuke Air Force Base\n\nSky Harbor International Airport\n\nPalo Verde Nuclear Generating Station\n\nLake Pleasent\n\nSuperstition Mountains\n\nMogollon Rim (as a bonus, maybe a variant where the fight is during a wildfire, similar to Verdun Heights from BF1)\n\nFlagstaff\n\nGrand Canyon (obviously)\n\nLake Havasu Island (within Lake Havasu City)\n\n**To anyone familiar with Arizona, what would you add?**"

9z2bu9,An anime RPG (eg. a Bleach RPG),"My idea about this is basically a video game of the Bleach Universe, however, instead of the usual fighter style games like Heat the Soul, Tekken ect. It's a video game with a gameplay similar to that of something like Skyrim or Dark Souls. The player would take on the role of Ichigo and is able to explore Karakura Town, Soul Society and Hueco mundo. Following the story of the Manga by Tite Kubo, including the Thousand Year Blood War. It would include a proper more fluid form of  a battle system, that would make the fight seem more realistic, like instead of having a character attack and the opponent is just hit, the opponent would defend and parry or something. Look for all you haters of this idea, I just came up with it on the spot. Or even a DBZ game like this or a Naruto game."
9z119v,"Looking for a game idea for turn-based, browser, multiplayer game","Hi. I got some spare time to work on a side project and want to make a browser game and looking for ideas/my idea improvement. It will be a hobby project and I am not aiming to make a new super popular game, but would like to make it the way that players could actually play it and enjoy, and maybe release it one day, so want to plan beforehand :)\n\nI was thinking about something turn-based and tactical, with a combat system a mix of Heroes Of Might and Magic 3 and [Duelyst](https://store.steampowered.com/app/291410/Duelyst/). So you would a have grid, let's say 10x5, and 2 players on both sides(left and right). Each player controls a set of units. Units are placed on the board not during the game but in advance, like in chess. Players take turns. Each player has action tokens they use to control their army. Move that unit 5 cells forward will cost 5 action tokens. Attack enemy unit with my archer unit will cost 3 action tokens, etc. When of actions, another player takes the turn. Players also can have special abilities that will empower their units, like, reduce movement cost, the next attack will stun the enemy, heal unit etc. For that player also uses action tokens or some other mana tokens. You win when you kill all the enemy units.\n\nSo that's the rough idea of a combat system that probably has lots of flaws. I would like to hear your thoughts on that.\n\nNow, the second aspect would be the overall game. And I have a few questions I am thinking and would like some help with:\n\n1. What is the overall game goal? Climb the leaderboard? That might get boring very fast.\n2. How would players progress? Acquire new units, new skills, develop their character. \n3. The effect of character development on the combat system. Units scale from the character stats?\n\nWould like to hear your opinions on that, thank you :)"
9z017u,Map Editor - The Game,"\n\nA Game That's sole intention is to drive players of games to create games easily.\n\n---\n\n#What is it?\n\nThink back to starcraft/wc3 days of playing UMS maps.\n\nI want to relive that and I think there needs to be a product solely for that audience.\n\nMy opinion is that we currently lack creativity in the genres of games today. Game development is a long and arduous process that can easily go astray for large teams working on a concept or be too expensive to teams with a low budget or without a fully fleshed out idea.\n\nI think that could change with a development environment that was simple to innovate in and get immediate testing and feedback instantly.\n\nI remember creating Survival maps, and RPGs, in Starcraft:Broodwar. SC:BW is where a lot of genres started, and has been nothing really like it since. It also wasn't really open to the broader market or advertised that way, it didn't even try to appeal to any audience other than the Starcraft community.\n\n\nThis game needs to be an arcadey platform to gamers to create a map(think rts survival), host a lobby, with a catchy title ""New Apocalypse themed survival map - Need Testers"" etc. Players join download the map from the host and are able to even host it themselves or edit the map after. From the lobby the game starts hosted from the creators connection.\n\nI imagine this as a 2D RTS game editor possible with 3D options or a 3D editor as a secondary title.\n\nThis could also be RTS Game Creator/2D Game Creator/etc\n\n---\n\n#Core Concept - Restrictions for success.\n\nIt needs to be easy for the average gamer to jump into with no real background experience, but not restrict more advanced players. [Basic scripting options, Location based triggers, Conditionals, Units creation, etc]\n\nIt should be focused on sharing and playing the games over creating them.\n\n---\n\nConcept Art? I was bored..\n\n[Menu](https://i.imgur.com/c44iRFe.png)\n\n[Lobby](https://i.imgur.com/vbAt2Fh.png)\n\n[MapEditor](https://i.imgur.com/vbAt2Fh.png)\n\n---\n\nMight update later, Time for sleep."
9yzntw,[Dream] The Game.,"A virtual gaming platform that houses different types of gameplay within one thematically connected world.\n\nThere would be three distinct ""levels"" to gameplay in this world:\n\nCIVILIZATION - CITY - GROUND\n\nCIV - the civ level would essentially be a large scale game of Civilization except it is played by many users on a time scale of months/years. Decisions made at this level take significant real time to propagate through the rest of the game world. This is the platform on which clashes between factions would be orchestrated. This is where a faction would allocate its resources and partake in politics and spying and direct a faction in broad strokes.\n\nCITY - the city level would consist of gameplay akin to SimCity and Cities Skylines. Users could create different designs of infrastructure within a city that are limited by the resources allocated to the city from the civ level. These designs would be voted on by the citizens of the city and built by users and NPCs on the ""ground"". \n\nGROUND - the ground level is where more of the classic gameplay would take place. Users would have a stable of characters like a normal MMO but these characters can be used in a variety of different gameplay types. FPS, RTS, MOBA could all be conflicts between rival clashes that take place on the CIV level. RPG and adventure games could take place elsewhere on the map. Minecraft and building games could take place withing cities where users and NPCs build the infrastructure designated at the above levels.\n\n\nThat is the bare bones idea behind ""The Game"". I understand it would be a titanic undertaking that would probably require a decade of development and would hinge upon a massive user base. Also that the chance of a single developer being capable of creating a worthwhile experience across so many genres on one seamlessly connected platform is slim at best. That being said, if a company was audacious enough to pull it off it could be an incredible experience. I imagine how streamers and their communities would factor into the decisions made on the CIV level and the interesting dynamic that would create across the streaming platform. \n\nNow that I've typed it all out I suppose this is essentially the world that exists in Ready Player One and all of a sudden I don't feel like I came up with the idea at all and I should maybe smoke less weed!\n\nCheers!\n\n"

9ywbnc,Round Survival Game - ‘These Damn Elves’,"—The idea: \nSanta’s elves are tired of the slave labor they endure to make all of the toys every year. This Christmas they’re taking it back to Santa. \n\n—The narrative: \nYou play as Santa Clause who must defend himself against the onslaught of elves that come in these endless waves, using a ‘round’ system.\n\n—Online: \nOnline you can play in a group of 1-4 players and survive together. You can either be: Santa, Mrs. Clause, The “Grouch” (grinch knockoff), or Yukon Cornelius (from Rudolph).\n\n—Mechanics: \nThis will be a 3D soft-rendered type game. You survive as many ‘rounds’ as you can. Santa will be able to defeat the elves with his bare hands, but at the end of every round he can go to his sack of presents and use elf souls to purchase new weapons (sharpened candy-cane throwing knives, etc.), or purchase upgrades. \n\n—Game modes: \nFor now I have 2 game mode ideas: One is a classic horde/round survival with Santa just by himself in sort of an enclosed ice area where the Enemies will come out of various crevices or caves. The second is where Santa has to defend the workshop, the enemies will be attacking it, but also indirectly Santa. He will be able to set traps around the workshop, and using elf souls he can buy different traps or upgrade defenses. \n\n—Playable Characters: \n-Santa Clause: this will not be the ‘Jolly’ Santa model. He will be a sort of comically buffed up version able to throw elves around. He will be complete with Santa hat, a sleeveless Santa coat, and tactical Santa pants with combat boots. He is strong and has abilities matching his strength (e.g. able to pick up and throw elves). \n\n-Mrs. Clause: Big fat old woman with rosy cheeks. She cusses up a storm; she’s so pissed at these elves. Her abilities are to be able to craft certain traps, (e.g. cookie bombs), once her meter fills up for that craftable. \n\n-The ‘Grouch’: The grouch is a furry, colored creature who has a lanky stature while wearing tattered Christmas gear. He is very agile and cunning; able to do evasive maneuvers, and turn some elves against each other. \n\n-Yukon Cornelius: A strong dwarf type character; he has a flannel lumberjack look. He is equipped with a pickaxe and is able to make quick work of low-level elves. \n\n—Enemy NPCs: \n-Elves: there are several types of elves that will be amongst the horde. There are: the low-level keebler-type elves (about 2 foot tall, not much of a threat, but there are many), the fudge-packers, (tank like elves that got fat as fuck off of cookies), the buffies, (elves that followed Santa’s workout regimen and are about twice as tall as low level elves and buff as fuck, able to throw lower elves into battle).\n\n-Reindeer: \nAll of Santa’s reindeer have been recruited by the elves to turn against Santa. They come as bosses every 5 waves or so; able to fly around and dive-bomb Santa. Once killed they drop max ammo and refill all abilities/health. The only reindeer that is not an enemy is Rudolph, he is able to be used as a purchase with elf souls and can help turn the tide against the horde (non-playable). \n\n-Snowmen/Snowcreatures:\nThese are evil snowmen created by the elves with their magical crafting powers. Most snowmen are normal and move at a very slow pace towards Santa (acting as more of a shield for the elves), others are snow creatures (created with big branches from trees and can be a tough challenge). \n\n—Market/sales:\nThis will be kind of a niche market during the holiday season, but can be converted to other titles for the other seasons (e.g. Halloween). Game will be Gory, with Mature content such as foul language and blood. Targeted demographic will be late teens/early adults. Game should sell for around $11.99 at launch, $7.99 at winter sale. \n\nLet me know what you guys think! I came up with this today after watching the new Grinch movie oddly enough, LOL. \n\nP.S. please give credit of this/me if referenced or used.\n"

9yq830,Hello r/gameideas,"I am new here, as well as to reddit overall\nBut I do think i may be really active here as I have... honestly too many ideas for games lol\nBut ill spare the sappy details and get into the meat of an idea ive had for a while now\n\nThe gameplay is similar to Life is Strange/basically any of Telltale's games, except it tries to make the choices matter as much as possible, moreso than those\n\nBut as for the story, it's about a girl who has the power to control her weather based on her emotions(happy = sunny, sad = rain, depressed = snowy) and nobody knows about it. It takes place in a fictional town, but focuses generally on the small towns high school in which shes a student. She tries to keep herself happy with the pressures of high school, her parents having conflicting ideals of what she she should do (i.e. dad says nurse/doctor, mom says pilot) and neither of which she wants to do, but they refuse to listen to her and just want to vicariously live through her. The whole time though, shes trying to keep her powers secret from everyone.\n\nBut heres the thing, you dont play as her.\nYou dont even know her at the start. You play as a guy/girl(because everyone loves lesbians) in her class, and you get paired up for an assignment/project. From there, whatever happens is your choice. Do the two end up as friends? Do they end up as something more? Or do they end up hating eachother?\n\nThats basically all i got so far.\nThoughts? Criticism? Adjustments? Yall are probs alot better at this than i am lol"
9yn6r3,A nice idea for a MOBA,"this is my first time thinking of a game but i want a game like this, if there is already 1 then tell me\n\nMain function:\n\n\- Customizability: each character can customize 1 weapon, 2 skills and 1 ultimate\n\n\- Passives: each character has 1 simple passive\n\n\- No items: characters don’t need items so the game is faster\n\n\- Leveling: all the character’s abilities are unlocked but starts at level 1 and has to be leveled to 5. All characters starts at level 1 and their maximum is 16\n\nIdea:\n\n\- The game is like a basic moba but the characters are able to customize before a game making each round diverse.\n\n\- All classes are basic in terms of stat and passives but it’s diversity in weapon and skills make each class reliable and can make roles interesting to play.\n\nGamemode:\n\n\- Classic: 6 towers, destroy until you reach the core and destroy it to win.\n\n\- Free for all: 5 people fight for 10/30 points\n\n\- Capture: 3 points, capture all.\n\nCharacters:\n\n\- Defence: knight, paladin, warlord, engineer\n\n\- Damage (physical): duelist, barbarian, swordsman, gunner, archer, monk, beast\n\n\- Damage (magical): magician, summoner, shaman, pyromancer, cryomancer, druid, aquamancer, alchemist\n\n\- Support (damage): assassin, scout, saboteur, trapper\n\n\- Support (magic): priest, bard, witch doctor\n\nStory:\n\n\- In a universe where magic and multiple gods exists, there are people over centuries that use magic for reaching accomplishments that changes the world for a better place and there is figures, blessed by beings of power  that has helped discover and conquer the world, these people became figures that motivates others to advance. Now those have died are in the afterlife, the gods have a world where these conquerors and idealists meet an honorable battle to show their position as a figure of accomplishment and determination.\n\nExpected way of gameplay:\n\n\- I start a match\n\n\- I pick a character and i pick a weapon, skill, and ultimate\n\n\- the match starts\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso i wanted a game where there it is you to decide how to play the class, because games where you are restricted to pick a character with 1 role and 1 way of playing is imo bad because characters can occupy only 1 way of them being played and adding more characters for diversity  will result to making the game overwhelming in playing it and fixing it. and since the the game don't have items, maybe the game can be fast for quicker gameplay\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ni can draw so should i draw a concept art of each characters? and is my idea good?"
9ymz3f,A racing game turns into a creepy driving game as you explore the desolate world outside of the race course.,"This is a creepy experimental game, emulating how [some low budget racing games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mB1zWEhgrLs) have let you exit the race area and explore the empty landscape outside. Except this is done with a more oppressive tone and hints of a sinister story.\n\nThe game would start like a standard racing game set within a city (like Project Gotham Racing) but after the race ends, the player isn't booted out of the area to the next race. Instead the music fades away and other racecars vanish one by one like they're being unloaded from RAM.\n\nThe player is meant to think the game bugged out. After they find a way to exit the racetrack, they'd be allowed to explore the surrounding city backdrop. The further out they go, the lower textures are on everything. Some buildings don't even have backsides.\n\nBut there's some weird traces in the game world. You might come across tire track donuts in some parking lot. There's an abandoned racecar. And there's a gas station which slowly fills up your gas tank just by staying near the pumps (you'd only notice if you change the camera view to the car's interior and look at the gauges on the dash).\n\nThen the player might come across a *wrecked* racecar. The driver side door is bused off its hinges and there is blood on the ground, but there's nobody inside.\n\nIt's after this point that the game procedurally trigger an event in which the player would notice headlights in the far distance. There's someone else here."
a456fu,Summer,"Sunny days, adventure, freedom and no school. The best part of the year that every kid love. In almost every game we play as an adult. But sometimes some game with kid or young as a protagonist comes out. Life is strange, The last of us, child of light, bully, the walking dead and south park. And these games are actually good! And all of them all for adults.\n\nI would like to see open world game where I will play as a kid. Set in middle Europe during early 21 century. Riding bikes! building shelters, delivering newspapers for money, but mainly resolving some mystery, fighting with kids from other school, drugs, getting to serious trouble with local serial killer or breaking in to houses for evidence. Police catch you? Game over. Player or other kids can broke leg, arm and it will take a week to recover. But you have time only to the end of summer. Maybe then could continue after year and game would show you what happend.\nThis game needs very good story."

a41epg,A game of Disguise,"This is a very rough idea. It'd be great if you guys would help me better this idea.\n\nA game where one team of X number of players get to blend in to the crowd and the other team with X number of players has to find them in the crowd.\n\n**The Goal:** The goal of the team who is hiding is to keep hiding from the enemy players for a certain amount of time by blending in the environment. And goal for the team who is finding is to find the enemy team by unusual activity that is happening in surrounding. \n\nBoth team gets the chance of hiding one after the other.\n\n**Mechanics:** The team who is finding them has to keep watch of any unusual activity that is happening in the crowd to find the player. Here, NPCs are walking around doing their job and any unusual activity will be the trace for the finder to the hidden player. The players hiding can be disguised as anyone they want. Now, the ones who are hiding has to keep doing the things that NPCs are doing. If they are caught off guard, it'll give out to the finder who will chase that person and once caught, the game is over.\n\n**Setting:** A great setting can be an airport. \n\nHere, NPCs are doing what normal people would do. There are people waiting for a flight, bringing another players to the airport in a cab, coming in the cab, selling stuff at stalls, etc. The hiding players has to blend by doing activities like them. The finding players can put CCTV anywhere they like, chase anyone they like, and keep chasing them until they find out what the NPC/Enemy players' purpose is. FP can do random checks on NPCs in hopes of finding the HPs. Both team has access to voice chat internally. The HPs cannot stay at one point for a long time because it would give their location out with the help of technology.\n\n**PS:** It sounds like a very normie idea right now but it was fire when I was thinking about it."

a3w014,Your thoughts? Opposed dice + modifiers,"I've been mulling ideas for a fast-paced tabletop/miniatures game around for a couple years. One of the factors I always get hung up on is the dice system. As much as I'd love to have a unique dice system that adds a new dimension to the game, I don't think I am creative enough to make something unique or not convoluted. So, I'd like to ask your thoughts about opposed dice + modifiers.\n\n**To explain the flow of combat as simply as possible:**   \nFull move -&gt; Number of actions based on weapon (i.e. handgun vs smg) -&gt; Move again (1-3 squares, depending on speed). \n\nTerrain squares will affect combat effectiveness (high ground, low ground, obstruction, visibility, etc..), therefore second move action to allow for a layer of strategy, I think. Weapons will have accuracy that befits the type of weapon (A sniper rifle is more accurate than a machine gun). Modifiers will be kept fairly small as to not make combat *too* swingy and to \[hopefully\] make calculations more manageable. **Sidenote:** I do realize that more things to do per turn = longer turns = potentially not fast-paced. The vision I have isn't necessarily fast-paced play, but mechanics that paint the picture of a fast-paced battle. Of course, I do want the turns themselves to as quick as possible to nurture a more intense feel.\n\n**How do the dice affect combat?**   \nThe idea I have is d100 +/- terrain modifier +/- accuracy modifier. I realize that's probably a lot of math for a miniatures game, but I feel it fits the game's theme. I'll consider scaling the dice down if I can figure out a ratio that I like. I like the idea of percentiles, but I am also aware that bigger numbers = longer to calculate.\n\n**The specific questions I'm looking to have answered are:**  \nWill this system contribute to a fast-paced environment? (Or will too much time be spent on calculating?)  \nWould you consider a system like this to be easy for new players to pick up?  \nDo you feel that a system like this would get old fast?  \nDisregarding theme, do you think you would play a game with this kind of system?  \nWhat sorts of things do you look for or expect in a dice-based game? (Not necessarily this one)  \nAny advice for me as I continue my journey into this development?  \n"
a3v196,Procedurally generating dice/board game with free movement,"Story: Everyone used to be crewmates on a pirate ship but they got into a fight and their ship sunk, now they are fighting to regain as much of the treasure for themselves as they can.\n\nOn round start, everyone spawns on their own islands spread around a volcano in the ocean. Each pirate gets a personal treasure chest that 75% of their total treasure is stored in (the rest is on the pirate and will drop on death) and they can lift it around to hide it. Your own chest's location is always shown to you and an alert is given out if someone gets close to it.\n\nThe volcano shoots out a dice for each pirate in a specified interval and they land on a random island segment of the island each pirate is currently standing on.\n\nThe islands are all placed on a hexagonal grid net and can be expanded by dropping the dice in the water where there isn't an island segment, if you try to do this in between another pirate's and your own island, a destructible bridge is instead made. The higher number on the dice, the better the segment will be with higher amounts of vegetation and increased chances of getting random loot hidden on it. \n\nPirates can obtain loot on island segments that will help them defend or attack against other pirates like swords, barricades, traps, decoys, etc. \n\nYou will keep respawning unless you are completely without riches for a specific amount of time or if someone drops your treasure chest into the ocean. (That would lead to suicide and transformation into a spectating parrot which can rat out information)\n\nYou can team up with other pirates for a higher chance of surviving but don't be surprised if they stab you in the back. \n\nYou win by being the last pirate standing."

People start at various entrances of the airport and have to make it through the airport and board the plane. You can pick various 'classes' that offer dis- and advantages. E.G. you could pick the 'backpacker' class that is the strongest and comes pre-equipped with a lot of items but is slower due to his bag. Once you make it on the plane the fight isn't over yet, you still have to fight over the overhead compartments. You'll only be able to take the items you that you put in the overhead bin; You'll always be able to take at least 1 item for balance reasons.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnce you arrive at the next airport you need to fight for your connecting flight.

If you use an item (bandage or cloth), it prevents as much bleeding, unless the wound is too big (say, over 150%, I guess).\n\nHowever, you loose blood (""HP"") constantly relative to how high the wound percentage is.  For example, 1 HP per percentile per 10 seconds.  If you loose too much ""HP,"" you start to get dizzy, and some attacks will miss.  Loose much more, and you'll pass out, falling victim to the enemy, or getting rescued if enemies aren't around and you're in a populated area.\n\nBlood is replenished over time if you have proteins and water in you, and it's relative to how many bones you have in your body (in case you get amputated).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you get hit by a penetrative attack, such as a knife or bullet, your innards get hurt and you take ""permanent percentage"" damage (permanent bleeding), which cannot be clothed and can only be expiated by going to a hospital.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you get hit by a venomous/disease-ridden attack, the chances of you getting intoxicated/diseased are relative to your wound percentage.  If you DO get ill, you have a set time to get to a hospital.  If you go too fast, though, then you'll let your blood run faster, facilitating the venom's adventure to your heart.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLastly, if you feel too much pain in a short amount of time, you'll pass out from pain shock.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEh?"

When the scientists wake up, they are at their desk, and had made pages upon pages of notes and research and have discovered a startling, but fascinating truth. When an object is propelled at a sufficient enough speed through a pentagram shape made with a mammal's blood, it travels to another dimension. The scientists get together and create a secret mission to send people into the dimension. As you may have guessed, that dimension is Hell. The government eventually learns of the project but instead of just shutting it down, they take control of the project. They eventually send 4 people into Hell.

Gold is granted to the player for building shapes or stacking blocks of same color.\n   * the player and the AI have an ""attack zone"", which initially is around 50% of the battle field/rectangle. Units can attack the opponent's units only if they are within their ""attack zone"". The ""attack zone"" can be enlarged with gold\n   * the opponent (AI) has a ""mine zone"" where miners can mine blocks dropped by the player, only if they are within the AI's ""mine zone"". The ""mine zone"" can be enlarged with gold\n   * with gold earned, player and AI can hire/train units to attack enemy units and eventually attack the enemy fort  \n\n* Goals:\n   * main: destroy the opponent's fort\n   * secondary: build shapes with the blocks dropped to earn gold  \n\n* Mechanics:\n   * the player releases blocks 1 at a time, every X seconds (the interval can be decreased by buying time with gold). The blocks form shapes and that grants gold to the player.\n   * The opponent can send its miners to mine those blocks. When a block is mined it disappears but blocks above it don't fall as in Candy Crush."
a3cwz7,An RPG where you play as a soldier for the Empire.,"Basically think if in Final Fantasy 6 you were playing as a Soldier and your party was comprised of other soldiers of the Empire. Rather than playing the heroes you play as the grunts and experience what it's like for them having to carry out orders that would be seen as ""evil"" by the heroes. Or how an encounter with the heroes, which would normally be viewed as another simple battle by one side, be seen as a life or death event where many of your comrades are sure to die. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would imagine the game to be rather linear as your commander is giving you orders for where to go and what to do, but options would be given to you during events. For example, you are ordered to burn down a village to disrupt supplies to the nearby castle. Do you allow the villagers to leave? Do you burn them along with the village? Do you capture them to use as slaves? Do you refuse to take part in the order and get punished? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs you progress you build a bond with your party and get to know squad mates better (backstories/ etc) A certain anxiety will build as you realize that the harder the battles get the more likely it is these characters will die. No revives. Perhaps there could even be an easier mode that when a character reaches 0 HP there's like a coin flip to see if the character dies or is just wounded.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe action in the game would be the combat you would face against other nations/ heroes (later on in the game).  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow I think the game would go.  (Story)----&gt; (Event where you must make decisions) -----&gt; (Combat) -----&gt; (Story continue or new event decision), Repeat.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGive me your honest thoughts."
a3c1ry,Two game ideas,"The first idea I had was a horror game - where you're trapped in a room, the only thing you can interact with are security cameras and through the security cameras you have to relay instructions to characters in order to free you.\nEach character would have their own stress levels that are affected whenever they encounter a monster/have to run or hide from said monster.\n\nCharacters with high stress would also affect their ""trust"" and the less trust they have in you, the more chances of the character not listening to you instructions, getting killed or escaping themselves.\n\nI'm not 100% sure how ""scary"" this would be...any feedback would be appreciated.\n\nMy second idea I had would be a fantasy RPG where you play a hero who's just settled down with his new wife on a quiet farm. \nEventually you find out your ""wife"" is actually the antagonists daughter - who's been summoned to control his armies. \nWhile she still loves you she wants you to join her by her side, commanding the demon army.\n\nYou as the protagonists would have a choice - stop her armies from committing atrocities on innocents or commit them yourself and join her.\nThe difficulty of the game/dungeons would be determined by the relationship you have with your wife.\n\nAlong the way you'd meet other party members and/or other love interests that would persuade you to act a certain way.\nShe caught you romancing a party member? Prepare for the difficulty to ramp up and/or enemies target her specifically.\n\nAt the end the game would present one of the multiple endings which would be determined by your relationship level with her and other characters.\n\nImplementation of this would very complex with the amount of dialogue and the colossal.\n\nAny feedback on these ideas would be appreciated  \n\n\n"
a3aixy,"I have a controls idea, but no game to match. Let's come up with ideas together!","So I was trying to think of fun, time-waster games that a couple people could pick up and play anywhere, any time (with a smart phone). While I couldn't think of a specific game or any actual gameplay, I did think of a neat way to initiate such a game.  \n  \nSo I though, maybe the players can face each other and hold opposite sides of the same phone, the short side. Given there's not a ton of room, the game would probably need to be controlled with only 2 or 3 buttons on each side. I can't even see how a D-pad would be very functional with limited space.  \n  \nI don't think a competitive game would be a great idea. That's begging for someone to yank the phone out of the other's hand, phones will get dropped, no good. But some sort of co-op game could work.  \n  \nA couple random thoughts I had:  \n  \nMaybe something like One Finger Death Punch where enemies fly in from all angles and each person has to press a button in time with an enemy getting close to them. Players can pick up power ups and consume them for themselves or maybe toss them over to the other player with a swipe.  \n  \nAnother thought was sort of like Uncooked. Ingredients come in, players can only hold X number of ingredients on their side of the screen. They have to prepare these ingredients, pass them back and forth, pick up more ingredients, etc. Trying to fulfill orders.  \n  \nWould love to flesh out this idea. I think there might be a host of games that could be fun in this shared phone format.  \n  \nAnd FWIW, I got the inspiration for this from watching my gf's brother and newphew playing games on their Switch together."

a2y2pa,Retro Computer Company Game,"I had this idea for a game, set in the early days of computers when they could be assembled mostly by hand. Think Apple II era 8-bit computers. In the game, you design your own computers to sell, while managing the type of chips and other components you use.

Obviously, this would need to be balanced so there's some benefit to using the better parts, like a lower failure rate etc. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe game would start out in your garage, with only basic tools like a soldering iron, and you would assemble the computers by hand before you can afford to hire more employees. You have a variety of chips (memory, processors), capacitors, etc, and you can spec out the computers as you please, while being mindful of the demands in the market and what your competitors are doing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the actual assembly, I had in mind a system that gives you a blank circuit board, and you place chips on the board and they snap into place, then you can solder them on. The placement of the components can give different results, like better or worse speed, overall size, power consumption, etc.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese are basically the ideas I came up with for now, but I'm not sure how the game would progress later in the game.

I can't choose a mechanic that revolves around the game, maybe dialogue or something like that, and there could be ""persons"" a.k.a.  manifestations of thoughts you could talk to.

a2pl6d,"A spiritual successor to Skate, BMX XXX, and Jet Set Radio in a sense.","This is my first time posting in this sub so forgive me if this isn’t the most well written post or if someone has had this idea before.\n\nBasically my idea is for a video game very similar to Steep (2016) developed by Ubisoft.   In this game it’s a free roam open world extreme sports game. In this game you would be able to ride; skateboards, longboards, roller blades, scooters, and BMX bikes. The game would involve games of S.K.A.T.E , races, jams, and freestyle skating. You could also play against friends in private sessions. The skateboarding mechanics would ideally work a lot like the Skate games.  Longboards would have multiple different styles of game play based on which board you use. You could carve, dance, or downhill etc. (I’m not the most experienced with scooters,BMX, or roller blading so if you have any ideas for those gameplay elements please reply with your idea) \n\nAs for the setting of the game I would ideally have it set in modern day  Los Angeles or a variation of that city. \n\nAnother interesting gameplay element I would want implemented is people not wanting you to ride or skate in certain areas. They might call the police and you would have to escape the area and avoid the cops on your board to avoid being arrested. Some areas might have skateboarding deterrents on rails and benches which you would have to manually remove at the risk of being caught and having the cops called.\n\nCharacter customization would be in depth allowing you to be any race, male or female, put any haircut you want or clothes. You could maybe even make some crazy monstrosity of a custom character lmao.\n\nAs for a points system I feel like the Skate series would be the biggest influence. \n\nI’m not gonna lie as I write this I’m feeling excited as if this game is actually being made. We can only hope you know lol\n\nLet me know what you think of my idea and leave any thoughts you might have! "
a2pjkg,A dungeon crawl roguelike that plays like a tactics RPG,"I was browsing around for a game with a job based system like Bravely Default of FF Tactics but I just can't get in to story dense games lately. I want the gameplay style with the just dive in nature of dungeon crawlers. This game doesn't exist, but as I thought about what it could be like more and more I felt like it was just a natural fit for the two genres. So here is how I see it working:\n\nFirst off, the gameplay. Your goal is to ascend deep as you can in to a never ending dungeon with randomly generated floors and encounters. Your party starts a floor by placing your troops on the tiles around the ladder/stairs. You then begin like any tactics game, fastest speed unit is selected, the ability to move X tiles based on stats, perform an action, end turn. Explore the floor, kill enemies, loot rooms, find the way down to next floor, repeat.\n\nWhere this would differ from tactics games is by mixing in the dungeon crawling gameplay. Hallways would have to be at least two/three tiles wide to accommodate any combat in them. Rooms wouldn't reveal what's in them until you go through the doors. Exploring everything and killing all the enemies isn't necessary, a floor only ends when their is none of your units left on it, be that by death or by descending/escaping.\n\nWhy I feel these blend so nicely is because these genres already have a number of features in common such as tile based combat that is also turn based, and permadeath.  First the permadeath, in a traditional roguelike you die and then that's it, start all over. However, with a party playing tactics style you could just lose a few party members, sure they die for good, but your overall progress isn't lost and you can recruit new members. Second, traditionally in tile based roguelike gameplay the combat is little more than hit, splat, loot. Adding in the tactics style play offers the same net result but makes it more exciting and interesting to get there. At their core the gameplay of both is governed by mostly the same system, it's just the execution that is different.\n\nTo flesh things out a bit there would be a world hub containing a shop to buy and sell, a recruitment office to get new troops, a training center to unlock new jobs, and of course the dungeon. You would play a noble interested in the treasures hidden within the dungeon but you are not any of the units, instead you are simply hiring troops to explore for you. This way you can have your entire party permadie, lose all their loot and equipment, but the game doesn't end. All the loot you have stored, all the money you've saved, that's still yours. With the money you have saved you can get new troops, and depending on how much you want to spend how good they start out will vary. You can also easily equip them with decent stuff and while you may have lost your favorite guy who had learned a lot of good skills and had that ultra rare armor, the game is not lost and you can press on, albeit with a setback.\n\nThe dungeon saves your progress every 10 levels and gets harder the more you descend, so you can start your new recruits on whatever level you feel they can handle. The dungeon can be escaped on any floor, but only by a member next to a ladder. One member escaping does not end the fight, it only saves that member. Same with progressing down, any member can progress down at any point, but the floor doesn't end until all members have gotten to the down ladder. Between floors the player is given the option to use magic and potions to heal up and buff before the start of the next floor. Floors are randomly generated every time they are entered, so unfortunately once you leave a floor there is no salvaging any of your dead comrades gear.\n\nAlright, I wrote this way too long and I won't be surprised if it's too much of a read for people, but having this idea kicking around in my head and not sharing it with anyone was causing me to think about it too much, and I just had to get it written down and out there. So, with no idea where to do that I ended up here! I'm sure I forgot some stuff, but it feels like all the major components are there. Thanks for everyone who had a read."

a2h6pc,An idea when it comes to a Team-Based MP game,"When it comes to team-based MP games, the factions are either Red vs Blue (I.E. Halo &amp; TF2) or Factions based on the map (I.E. MW2 &amp; Battlefield), but I feel that's kinda boring. I thought of a more unique means of deciding teams.\n\nThis system would see the two (or more) teams vote on their team prior to the match in a multi-step process. Though these would be fairly quick (each step would take a max of 10-15 seconds), they can be skipped if the majority agrees. If skipped, the teams will be randomly generated. Players can also vote on whether or not if they want to reuse the team names from the lobby's last game.\n\n#[Step 1: Team Color]\n\nTeams will vote on their team's color, there will be 12 colors to choose from. Colors would be...\n\n- Red\n- Blue\n- Green\n- Yellow\n- Orange\n- Purple\n- Cyan/Teal\n- Pink\n- Brown\n- White\n- Black\n- Gray\n\nIf both teams' majority votes on the same color, it will go to the team who had the more votes with the other team's color being the 2nd most voted. If still a tie, it will be randomly decided.\n\n#[Step 2: Category]\n\nWith the teams now decided on a color, all players will vote together on the theme of the team names/logos. The 6 categories are...\n\n- Animals\n- Cryptids &amp; Mythology\n- Space\n- Gems &amp; Crystals\n- Faction Types\n- Titles\n\nIf the majority is a tie, it will be decided by those who didn't vote for either majority. If still a tie, it will be randomly decided.\n\n#[Step 3: Alias]\n\nThe final step will have the teams decide on the name based on the category. Each category has 12 aliases...\n\n[Animals]\n\n- Tigers\n- Apes\n- Falcons\n- Hammerheads\n- Lizards\n- Vipers\n- Hornets\n- Wolves\n- Mustangs\n- Beetles\n- Squids\n- Spiders\n\n[Cryptids &amp; Mythology]\n\n- Yetis\n- Mothmen\n- Kraken\n- Werewolves\n- Vampires\n- Chimeras\n- Manticores\n- Nightcrawlers\n- Kodamas\n- Hellhounds\n- Zombies\n- Ghosts\n\n[Space]\n\n- Moons\n- Quasars\n- Stars\n- Dwarfs\n- Orbiters\n- Meteors\n- Galaxies\n- Stars\n- Novas\n- Holes (as in Black Holes)\n- Comets\n- Nebulae\n\n[Gems &amp; Crystals]\n\n- Rubies\n- Sapphires\n- Emeralds\n- Amethysts\n- Garnets\n- Diamonds\n- Quartz\n- Topazes\n- Spinels\n- Peridots\n- Jades\n- Ambers\n\n[Faction Types]\n\n- Rebels\n- Mercs\n- Extremists\n- Militia\n- Syndicate\n- Conscripts\n- Army\n- Special Forces\n- Operatives\n- Corps\n- Company\n- Agents\n\n[Titles]\n\n- Mavericks\n- Rookies\n- Experts\n- Elites\n- Champions\n- All-Stars\n- Defenders\n- Vagabonds\n- Wildcards\n- Immortals\n- Warriors\n- Zealots\n\nJust like with colors, if both teams' majority votes on the same alias, it will go to the team who had the more votes with the other team's alias being the 2nd most voted.

a2ffpu,Unreleased game had interesting idea.,"So worked on this game around 7 years ago for Vita. Never released, but had a great mechanic..   It was an adventure game where you had to try to work out who you were.. Every now and then you could enter a phone box and pick up the phone, it would randomly ring multiple phones in the worlds of other players.. \n\nIf a player answered it you could chat to the other player via a simple interface (no direct typing)..  The other player could choose to help you or give you false information.. Doing this you would get clues to the adventure you were on.\n\n\nI'm sure with some work it would be a nice mechanic.."
a2e666,A game like Source Code," After watching the movie Source Code I realised that it could be a fun game to play. The player takes over a person and has a short amount of time to figure out who killed them. If the player fails and the disaster/event occurs, then they will be reset to the position that they started in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe storyline would be that one of the protagonist loved ones, or himself died, and he needs to figure out who and how to save himself/or another person, in order to complete the game. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet me know what you think ;) "
a2ccx6,Looking for a game idea for a 16-bit visuals game,"I'm trying to think of something different.\nSomething much more than a typical adventure, mystery game which suits such visuals.\nEven the slightest hint of a good setting will help \nAny ideas?"
a2c3gd,Map creation wargame,Create your own map like in city skyline but can edit everything like in the farcry map editors. Gameplay would be like battlefield. Then you and other players play differnet modes on the maps depending on the size. Small maps tdm capture the flag infection free for all bigger maps could play domination maybe have vehicles. You could save other players maps and affect weather patterns in the settings

a29cok,The Belko Experiment: The Video Game,"Ever since I watched ""The Belko Experiment"", I have had a bunch of ideas swelling up in my head about how this movie can become a Video game, here are my ideas (Keep in mind, my ideas are not fully fleshed out yet. If there is any mistakes or conflicting elements in what I have to say, please send me your constructive criticism ) (Also, if you didn't watch the movie, you probably won't understand what I'm saying)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1: GAME MODES\n\n\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBATTLE ROYALE: This mode is just your run-of-the-mill battle royale mode, You know how it goes. Who ever is the last one standing wins. lets move on to the interesting ones.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHIDE AND EXECUTE:  There are two teams in this mode. The Hiders, and The Executors. The majority of Players will be the hiders, but a small selected few are executors. The Hider's objective is to hide as long as they can until the timer will run out. Once they spawn, (which can be in random places), The Executors are blindfolded for 60 seconds. This will give the Hiders enough time to go and hide. Also they can't pick up weapons or harm executors. The Executor's objective is to find the hiders and well ... Execute them . Once the executors are selected, they spawn in the lobby and are immediately given a handgun and a knife. If the executor does not like the items he or she has been given, they can choose to ditch whatever weapon they have to go get a tape dispenser or some other weapon of their choosing. If the Executors manage to kill all of the hiders before the timer runs out, they win the round. However, if the timer runs out before the executors manage to kill all hiders. The Voice will come on the intercoms and announce their failure to kill all hiders and then informs the executors that each of them will be eliminated by their headtags, once all of the executors are eliminated, the hiders win the round.   \n\nTIMEBOMB: In this mode, Only 2 floors are available to pass through. Each player will spawn on one of those 2 floors and will be given a handgun and will informed by the voice that each of them have 30 seconds until their headtag detonates. To avoid this certain fate, the player will have to kill other players, a signle kill will add 5+ seconds to the player's timer. Whoever is the last standing wins.\n\n3 STAGE: This mode is similar to the 3 Stages in the movie. In the first stage, The players will be given the task to kill a small amount of players in a small amount of time or more players will be eliminated by their headtags. In the second stage, the players are tasked to kill a bigger amount of other players in a bigger amount of time or even more players will be eliminated by there headtag. In the third and final stage, the last standing players will be tasked to kill every player until you are the last standing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would mention the other modes I have in mind, But I want to get on to some of my other ideas. So, I'm gonna have to end this segment here.\n\n\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n2: CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATION\n\n\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe character customization is sort of similar to Fallout's character customization menu. You can choose to make your character's face the most ugliest thing in existence or make it look like Tom Jones but got his face ran over by so many cars and trucks, that you couldn't tell if it was Tom Jones. . You can name your character whatever you want (Ben Dover, Mike Hawk, Grongnak). You can make your character Overweight or Underweight. You can write a Little Bio for your character (What place their from, what's their favorite hobby, ETC) For an example, Hi my name is \*Garfield\* and I like to eat \*lasagna\*. You can choose to make your character's bio public or not. There is one thing I'm on the fence on, and That is cosmetics. I don't want to give the player too much freedom. I want to try keep things within the office style, Or else there will be a guy to run around the building, wearing a dress. So, I might give players the option to customize their character's clothing, But the clothing will have to be within the office style.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n3: WEAPONS AND ARMORY\n\n\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAlmost everything in the building is a weapon. The tape dispenser is a weapon, The scissor is a weapon, The coffee mug is a weapon. To give a sense of what is powerful than the other, I made a tier list.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTIER 1: The tier one weapons are the office supplies (Keyboard, Tape dispenser, Stapler, Coffee mug, ETC).\n\nTIER 2: The tier two weapons are the kitchen utensils and upgraded office supplies (Knife, Meat clever, Bulky Tape dispenser, Sharper scissors, ETC)\n\nTIER 3: The tier three weapons are in the armory ( Handgun, Revolver, Expandable Baton, ETC). They can also sometimes be in employee's cubicles.  \n\nTIER 4: The tier 4 weapons are very rarely in the armory (Shotgun, M27, Machete, ETC). These weapons won't spawn anywhere else but the armory, and they are rarely in the armory. If you're lucky while breaking/unlocking the armory, You can find the tier 4 weapons. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are 2 ways to get into the armory. 1. You could try and find the armory key. or 2. You could blow torch your way to the armory. In the second way, You would need to find a blowtorch first. Once you've acquired a blowtorch. You can start the process of blowtorching your way through the armory. I should inform you that the process is EXTREMELY Slow. There can be a good chance that someone might come up behind you and kill you. So, you would need a few buddies gaurding you while you're blowtorching. \n\n\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n4: CRAFTING MECHANIC \n\n\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe crafting mechanic is very similar to the Minecraft's crafting menu. You can upgrade weapons and even craft your own. There are some very special weapons you can get only through the craft. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTHE BOW AND ARROW: Broken Broom stick, Rubber Bang, Plastic ruler.\n\nFLAMETHROWER: Gas cylinder, Metal Pipe, Blowtoch, Rubber tube.\n\nMOLOTOV: Bottle, Gas, Rag. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am still thinking of some craftable weapons. So, if you can think of any, please put them down in the comments. \n\n\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n5: HEALTH ITEMS\n\n\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf your health is low, you can go and ransack a cubicle and try to find a heath item (Apple, Banana, wrapped salad, ETC). These items can only replenish your health by a little bit. But, if you're lucky, You could find a health kit. Which can replenish your health fully. \n\n(Sorry if this segment is a bit short)\n\n\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n6:MAPS\n\n\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFor now, the only map I could think of is the building from the movie. But, I am considering other buildings/maps. But for now, The Movie building is the only I can think of.\n\n\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n7:CONCLUSION\n\n\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThere are still a HUGE Amount of things to talk about. But for now, I'm gonna end the post here. I wish I could make this game, but unfortunately I don't have a team of programmers behind me and I am financially not in the position to make it. So, I am just expressing my concept to other people on the internet. So, please send me your thoughts about my concept, And if you have any criticism. please comment them below too. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;"
a5wadj,"In depth sandbox, magic, fantasy, RPG game idea.","Ok, so, I have an idea for a game that hasn't been done yet, but can most certainly work, at least, I think so. Let me walk you through from starting it up, to dying. You load up the game (Its for Virtual Reality), put on your VR headset ad see the starting menu. What the menu looks like does not matter. You click on play and are put into a character creator. You see a blank person in front of you (human, clothed) and navigate through what your race to be (Orc, Elf, Halfling, Human, etc), and then you choose your class (Paladin, Bard, Rogue, Wizard, etc), and each class gives you a bonus to strength and dexterity, which will come into play later. (I got the idea for this game while playing D&amp;D.) Of course, you have sliders for facial features, and I'm talking, this character creator is pretty in depth, maybe not black dessert (a game) but still, there are a lot of options. After creating your character you can choose a god to follow (Fire, Wind, Earth, Water, Magic (The gods will likely be the developers)) or no gods at all. The point of having a god to follow is so you can get things like protection from other gods, special powers, answers to your prayers that you send up by practicing a ritual (and the god may or may not answer), and whatnot. Certain gods will have certain requirements as well, like the god of earth might require you to free a deer's trapped soul if you kill one while hunting, and if you do not for three times in a row, you may be smited. If you choose the no gods route, just make sure you don't upset them, because they have no love for you. Anyway, after you press play, you are set into an open fantasy world (Like, a huge world, maybe a Continent), like that out of D&amp;D. Not only that, but pretty much everything is destructible. If you take a shovel and shove it into the ground (your in VR, remember) than dirt will come up and you have dug a hole. Congrats. If you take an axe to a tree, you need to mirror real life to do it, it doesn't have hitpoints, it has a trunk. then, to make a plank of wood, you would have to shape the tree trunk and nail it to your house using a hammer and nails (A hammer and nails that you or someone else makes). Now, you may be thinking, ""this is too hard, this would take to much time, I wouldn't waste my time building a house!"" Well that's why its a massively multiplayer server. You can get help from friends, or live in an inn that was already built by somebody else. You may also be thinking, ""If its massively multiplayer, and everything's destructible, won't it be anarchy? Will anybody's house be safe?"" Well, yes, because I believe I have found a way to make it so people will not kill each other. In games like, well, anything, people kill each other with no feelings whatsoever because the guy you just killed will respawn, and nobody will dislike you because of that fact. But in this game, when you die, you can't log in for another 24 hours, and must make a new character. Before you go, ""that's ridiculous, then I would never play, its too easy to die,"" let me tell you that that is the one thing that will make it so you don't die instantly. If somebody is afraid of having to go through 24 hours of waiting and making a new character, they won't kill anybody, because they are afraid themselves of being killed, that is what will make people make a society. Also, the chances of having a negative consequence to dying in a game (finally) will make fighting for your life, or assassinating somebody all the more fun, because it adds suspense. So that's how character creation, world shaping, and society works, now for combat. Being in a D&amp;D-ish world, there would be magic. I imagined the magic to be a hyped up version of VR Magic Gestures AI (Find it here -----&gt; [https://ravingbots.itch.io/vr-magic-gestures-ai](https://ravingbots.itch.io/vr-magic-gestures-ai)) and that's pretty much all that needs to be said. You can throw fireballs, force push, and lightning blast or whatnot. I'd imagine the spell list being pretty long. I think you could also cast spells by writing down a few symbols in your notebook and clicking on them with your finger. Now for sword combat. If you were sword fighting I feel like it would be a mix of Blade and Sorcery VR (here ----&gt; [https://store.steampowered.com/app/629730/Blade\_and\_Sorcery/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/629730/Blade_and_Sorcery/)) and Creed: Rise to glory with there phantom melee technology (here ----&gt; [https://store.steampowered.com/app/804490/Creed\_Rise\_to\_Glory/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/804490/Creed_Rise_to_Glory/)). You dexterity and strength with decide if the sword swings powerfully, but slow, or vice versa, directly influencing the phantom melee. If you were maxed out on Dex, a light sword or knife would give you best performance, and vice versa with strength. For bows, you have the option to pull back about halfway and then scroll down on the thumb pad to make your fake arm pull all the way back, and that's just for people that have headsets like the Windows MR headset that looses tracking if your hand goes behind your head. So yeah, that's combat. Also, if someone is targeting a certain player, no matter which character they choose, they should be banned and smited by a god. I fell like for locomotion, I would use something like the Freedom Locomotion system (here ----&gt; [https://store.steampowered.com/app/584170/Freedom\_Locomotion\_VR/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/584170/Freedom_Locomotion_VR/)) So that's it, my game idea. A game of kingdoms, run by players. A game of mercy, and revenge. A game of Gods and magic. Thank you for reading. (Unreal engine type graphics, forgot to say that)"
a5vujl,A Game with weird Sci-fi elements.,"Hi, r/gameideas.\n\nMy name is Xela, I have thought of this idea for one year and never shared it because I thought it was ""too simple"", and here I am sharing it with you.\n\nThe game will be an Platformer.\nThe core mechanic of the game is that the main character (UNNAMED) can twist the world to walk on the roof, offering new ideas for level design. This idea shall develop until an point in the middle of the game where the main character learns to twist the world to four directions.\nEnemies or props will stay in place even when the world is twisted and they're on the roof of the level.\n\nSimple as that.\nThe story, world or other mechanics should be decided by the developer who takes this idea.\nAlthough the world and story may fit more in a Futuristic setting.\n\nThanks,\nXela\n\n"
a5u0l7,Tropico Meets The Sims,"I want a game like Tropic where you make an island and a character. You are President and you are doing all the same things of Tropico. Except close to your election, you are randomly switched to a citizen of the country for a week. \n\nYou have to try and keep the citizen alive or else it has negative effects on your polls, which could already be bad. You have to feed them, clean them, etc. \n\nIf you have the island split where most is poor but 1% is rich. You could get a 1%er but the chances are higher of getting the worst off people. \n\nIf you are in the middle of a revolution or war, you are more likely to get a soldier then a civilian. \n\nI thought of this concept cause I like the idea of being the leader but also seeing first hand the ramification of your actions as leader. "
a5t8vf,Superpower for angel,"Hello. I'm currently working on story for my game. Game will be about angel with visions of future activated by interacting. The more players pass through the map, the more part of the story will appear. They can also change the details of story based on reactions.\n\nBut there is the problem. Visions of future is good idea (I think), but the game needs another superpower to combine. I would have to avoid the time and kinetic control."
a5qmlk,An MMORPG with SAO concept,"A large open world with some classic mmorpg aspects(skills, lvling, farming, looting etc) but with an odd twist. The game only progresses for everyone if a dungeon boss monster is defeated, but your character goes into a permadeath state where if you die within the boss fight, your character dies as well.\n\nIf you've ever watched Sword Art Online then you'd understand some of the concepts that inspires this game idea. The world of SAO is not class-based but each person has a unique skill set for each character. I would want a game not based upon hardcore grinding for higher levels but based upon the persons' skills. Some may be good at calculating shots and bullet trajectory, some have fast reflexes or some just likes to support. Combat is loosely based upon dark souls and Monster Hunter World where dodging and blocking are some main part of combat to make sure that -in a permadeath scenario- any hits you take is because you were greedy trying to hit the enemy or you didnt dodge well enough\n\nThe main aspect is the world building upon completion of a dungeon. The main world is filled with small monster or mini dungeons where loot are provided upon kills. This main world has respawning so you could always train with smaller monster or mini bosses. Main world is where you get to try out things, lvl up, get some unique rare loot etc\n\nOnly main dungeons are permadeath areas but upon killing the boss and completing the dungeon, a new open world area opens up with newer loot, towns, cities, monsters, dungeons and hubs. The previously defeated dungeon can be revisited and the boss can be killed again without the permadeath. \n\n**MAIN POINTS**\n\nThis entire concept is based upon the dungeon completion that progresses the game into a new area. The completion of the dungeon is not an isolated event. It would require a lot of planning and manpower to defeat a very difficult boss. More or less around 100 players in a session who are willing to fight and likely die to a boss that would benefit the entire server. Probably when the boss is defeated, it would take a day before the new area opens (as an update of sorts)\n\n**tl;dr**\n\nSAO style dungeons with permadeath, open world area like MHW with respawn, MMORPG aspects like WOW, ESO etc, and combat like Dark Souls and MHW. Its either semi futuristic like steampunk + magic or just traditional with swords + bow + magic"
a5l1oh,An alternative to FIFA Pro Clubs,"So Pro Clubs is my favorite game mode to play in FIFA... when I actually get to play it. EA has neglected the game mode so much that nobody plays it. Since there is usually only around 500 people online, it takes forever to find a match. But it has the potential to be amazingly fun and a huge money maker for them. They are so focused on Ultimate Team because that's the only game mode in which you can use FIFA points(FP). For whatever reason, they refuse to spend any significant amount of time on Pro Clubs because there is ""no money"" in it.\n\nIf you've never played FIFA or Pro Clubs, the idea is simple. You control your own player while you play against other players online. In a Pro Clubs drop-in match, you can connect with up to 9 other people for one game. If you play a match with your club against another club, you can fill up both teams with a total of 22 players. You'll be lucky to find a Club match, though, due to the lack of activity. So every time you play a drop-in, you improve your player's skill points based on your in-match statistics. If you play a club match, you have the opportunity to earn 3 skill points and use them on whatever skill you want to improve. I don't know if it's 3 skill points per match or 3 per win, but you get the idea.\n\nThe way this can be a money maker is simple. You could have only cosmetic items(so no pay to win) that players can buy with game currency which could be purchased with RL currency. Players could then buy things like hair styles, tattoos, makeup, jewelry, and boots. If you had teams play as shirts vs skins, you could have custom jerseys and players on the skins team would have their body art tattoos be visible.\n\nI really hope somebody considers making this game. It would be so much fun and I think it would put EA in their place. Once this game takes off with success, EA  will realize their mistake."

a596kt,V.engeance Day : A lite Tabletop RPG themed around a School Shooting,"So my friends asked me to DM a game with this basic premise: the player characters are four socially marginalized teenagers with the resources/lifestyle that would be available to typical middle-class suburban white high schoolers. Since these PCs are supposed to be social outcasts I was thinking of assigning each a random character flaw to explain why they get bullied.\n\nThe objective of the session is for each character to fulfill a personal vendetta assigned to their character (this may be killing a specific NPC, destroying a specific part of the school, or getting a specific message aired by the mass media), with the secondary objective of achieving a 'high score' by exceeding all other shootings in kills/damages.\n\nThe session will be divided into two distinct stages. Preparation, where the PCs have a limited time to gather the resources/training for their attack with the objective of avoiding detection, and then the attack itself.\n\nI was thinking of turning this into an standalone game with its own systems called\n\nV.engeance Day : The Column Pines High Massacre"
a594z1,Action rpg game idea????,"My team and I are working on ideas for an Action RPG style game. We have some core concept but we are terrible with lure. The game will play similar to a Skyrim meets dark souls game where you are individually fighting a great evil. We have character models and assets in play already so if you have an idea or have always wanted your story to come to life, go ahead and message us here and we will show you what we are working with. If you have any questions or want more specifics, feel free to message us below :)"
a57d73,Trading video game as side-scroller or top-down?,"Most of the time video games with focus on trading, the player experiences the world from a high-level, because the player sees most of the time the world map. For example in *Port Royale 2* and the *Patrician* series.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat about a trading game which works as a side-scroller or top-down? *Kingdom* shows that side-scrollers can work for simulation games. The player would experience the world on a low-level, which brings the opportunity to provide more or other gameplay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere are some examples:\n\n\- The player needs to explore the world, trading routes, shortcuts, cities and other places by itself  \n\- The player is able to really walk around in the city, talk to people and trade with them  \n\- During exploration of the world, the player may find goods to trade and is able to harvest thems  \n\- Maybe battles against bandits feels more exciting  \n\n\nThere are also some limits in comparison to the regular approach:\n\n\- The player is not able to control several merchants at once (But it would be possible to create routes and let a merchant trade automatically like in Port Royale 2)  \n\- Maybe the player has less of a ""I have built a big and successful trade empire""-feeling  \n\- Building a world with different landscapes and connect them needs more effort, especially in the side-scroller version\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis are just some ideas. But in my opinion, a trading game like this would be worth to give it a shot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do you think? Why are people playing trading games at all and can these mechanics be implemented as a side-scroller or top-down? What other pros and cons exists?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope you find that interesting."

One of our first projects is a MOBA.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe want people to be able to build their characters entirely. This goes as far as spell creation, in which we're aiming to allow players to create spells within a particular framework of the type of skill trees they've invested in. We're also thinking about allowing stats to be more customisable, to truly create your own hero, down to selecting your own passives. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis will break away from the norm of heroes and champions, but will lead to a more unstable meta possibly. We see this as positive in a way. Our intervention in the meta would be limited to what the tools we grant. We're not going to go wild by making tanks insane or nerfing magic users into the ground every patch. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe want to create a far more healthy business model and steer away from pay-to-win or unfair gambling systems which other games might have.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you have any ideas about features we could implement or things you think would improve the game, then feel free to comment and suggest away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou can follow our progress mostly via twitter: [https://twitter.com/oujoulia](https://twitter.com/oujoulia)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Thanks in advance!*"
a4y80j,What's the best approach for a Victorian werewolf?,"It's part of my dark themed brawler game. there's this character who is from the Victorian times and he can transform into a werewolf. the question is when he's in werewolf form his a strong, ravage, wild beast rushdown kind of play with super strength and reflexes. But in human form he's just an average height/size aristocratic gentleman which is weak in comparison. So when in human form what kind of fighting style would suit best for him? Just make him some zoner using Victorian magic? Or just have him being helpless, leaving the player to have to play it very safe and rush out of danger until his meter transformation can take affect again and turn back into the beast?\n\nAlso would it make sense for him to have an extended lifespan into the modern day?"
a4xj55,Battle royal set in the sky?,Would anyone here be interested in a battle royal where you’re flying. Not in jets or planes but maybe a broom stick or just flying in general. I was thinking spells instead of guns as weapons. \n\nLet me know what you think
a4t6z0,"Some fantasy, crazy hunters game.","I'm just thinking and I got an idea for a game just today. The main protagonist is a 14 year old girl named Cathy Anne. She lives in a log cabin with her single father who deeply cares for her. In the beginning, the player finds a newspaper warning people of animal hybrids that are 'freaks of nature that walks among us'. Later that day, Cathy takes a stroll on a dirt path in the woods. However, the path takes her deep in the woods. She starts to get scared since it was now night time.\n\nThen, she sees one of the creatures in the newspaper article. At first, she mistakens her as a human and tries to ask for help, The two of them both became startled and scared of each other until Cathy explains that she wasn't trying to hunt her down. The creature's name is Umbra who seems to be around the same age as Cathy. A new friendship forms between the two girls as Umbra guides Cathy back to her home. In exchange, Cathy swears that she'll protect Umbra from any hunters thus begins a new adventure. \n\nHonestly, I feel like the game mechanics and the controls should remain a secret because I don't want to give away my idea too much. Although, I feel like one important thing to mention is that hurting people is an option, not that it'll affect anything from the game. Well, that was my idea."

a4nee2,Dark Siblinghood: A refined and renamed ShadowBound.,"# Concept\n\nThe game revolves around the themes of risk, vunerbility, and loss. The games main mechanic is that there are real consequences to using your special abilities. For example, say you cast a healing move. The character who used it will get a small stat debuff and will risk getting closer to getting a very bad status condition. The 3 themes can also be seen in the story.\n\n# Story\n\nThe year is 202X. Monsters are fully integrated into society. They bring with them the ancient art of magic. One day, a plague sweeps across the world, affecting all magic users. To make matters worse, A giant behemoth is going on a mindless rampage. A month later, two siblings, Steven and Phara, are resting at a camp. They have goals to find their mother, who might give them a chance to stop this disease.\n\n# Party Members\n\nSteven: (A 16 year old, loves his guitar, and loves meeting new people. He can help the entire party, or hinder all the enemies.)\n\nPhara: (A phoenix girl who is Steven's foster sister. She is a magic based healer.)\n\nGary: (A skilled user of the Kamikaze style of fighting. He can damage himself in order to deal extra damage to the enemy.)\n\nScars: (An edgy skeleton who wants to do something good in his life for once. He is a magic based buffer/debuffer.)\n\nGrenda: (A lonely ghost, who is part in the physical world, part in the afterlife. She can use certain ""Ghost Items"" which are exclusive to her.)\n\nMore are going to be included.\n\n# Item Examples\n\nSome of the more interesting or game changing items are here.  \n\nTrash Burger (You got this out of a trash can, good? Restores 150 hp.)  \n\nPurifying Shot (Cures your body of dark magic. Restores all COR.) (COR is this game's version of SP.)  \n\nTrauma Kit (It’s like a hospital in a box! Cures Black Blood, Broken Bone, and Heart Attack.)  \n\nBrain Brew (Cleanses and jumpstarts your mind. Cures Insane, Unconscious, and Traumatized.)  \n\nHARM-ony (Beat the enemies out of sync with this guitar!)   \n\nScalpel (You are totally breaking the Hippocratic oath right now.)    \n\nRevolver (Your main attack will revolve around this gun.)\n\nRubber Knuckles (A piece of rubber with holes for your fingers.)  \n\nEnchanted Kevlar (A Kevlar vest enchanted with multiple spells and runes.)\n\n# What I need\n\nNot much actually, I would just love your input on this updated game idea.

a4hktj,Have a question,Making a game about 11 or 12 year old girl trying to rescue her friends from monsters in her neighborhood.

a4himh,Need a little help with my snowman idea :(,Ok I decided I would try and creat my snowman character idea for my dark toned theme brawler game and I think it would be cool to make the snowman some kind of trapping zoner all composed of ice and ice like attacks and abilities but right now it just seems really silly. What could I add to the design or plastyle to make the snowman character seem more serious and gritty? Or at least some way fitting as a cool concept brawling game character? Should he be from the arctic? Or somewhere deep in the Siberian forest or Himalayan mountains? Or some altered magic ice world?What would be a good way to make him look and feel opposing and not just some silly joke character? thank you.
a4h8c0,For Honor style?,"I have to say that For Honor is one of my favorite games, visually, also the combat system is a lot of fun. It also has a bit of difficulty that penalizes you for bad timing and spamming (in certain situations spamming works but you have to plan it, which is what I like about). I also enjoyed the solo campaign a ton and wish there was more to it. I feel like for Honor could make a really good coop or solo Dark Souls esk game where it’s super difficult and does not tolerate mess ups. In addition, it might make an amazing rpg, like the Elder Scrolls, where you find and make your armour and weapons, and go on quests and stuff. The animations are also amazing too, just watching the knight walk around in their armour is enough for me in For Honor. But I think they proved the capabilities of For Honor being a solo game with the pve and story modes. However, I wouldn’t want just a bunch of mini guys that are one hits, I would want each npc to be a challenge. Agree? Would you play it? \n+character customization too (like face and height stuff)\n+tons of different sets of armour"
a4glzq,Donald's bad day.,"I was watching some old Donald Duck cartoons with my kids yesterday, and literally everything in life seems to exist to make that duck miserable.\n\nLike he was trying to fill a bucket a water, and the water was doing everything it could to miss the bucket, or hit him in the face, etc.\n\nIt gave me an idea for a game where you play as this invisible force just fucking with Donald Duck's life.\n\nIf he tries to sit down, you pull the chair out. If he drives you blow his tire. Its kind of like hitman but your not killing him. \n\nEach level is Donald setting out to perform mundane tasks, and your scored based on how infuriated he is by the end.\n\nObviously Donald is copyright, but i love his flailing amd noises he makes when he gets really angry. If not Donald then and sentient Duck will do, but it needs a similar angry flail."
a4frrl,Game dev looking for ideas for a game. Combinatiok of LOL WOW Dota type of game with Hearthstone type of game,"So im a young game dev looking for a challenge. \n\nI want to create a game that have aspects of a MOBA and card game. Something like: u start a game with 3(more or less) champions that you control. They are like turrets cant move unless you use a card but you can equip them with weapons spells etc.\nSo the basic idea is to make something like a chess field and to put places for cards instead of the actual chess figures, just leave those 3 champs in the middle.\nThe goal is ofc,to win against your opponent in a way thar you combine your champion with cards that you got in your deck.\nSo for example both of then have 30 cards (10 for each champ) and maybe 10 extra (minions specials etc) then every turn u get a move card, which can move your figure/champ by one spot. You also get mana(or gold or something) to spend on placing cards. So you can Attack once with a champion every turn and you can attach different weapons on him (different for types like mage assasin warrior). The winner is the one that gets health of the opponent on 0 or less.\nI planned to make everythibg skill shot based (dont have a clue how to do that with static champs maybe i would put something that moves??) and every card can influence only a bit of the game (on the beginning) later ofc more mana means more powerful cards.\n\nI got this idea while i was playing LOL and when i realised how stupid the game is now, you cant fo anything if you dont pick the 20 most frequent champs, last 3 are pure oneclick cancer, and i wanted to bring back old strategy with new concepts. I hope u like the idea and I hope that u will have some ideas for me! \n\nIm also planning, if everything works out good, to make it AR conpatible so yoz can play it on the table with your friends(or even VR where you look trough the champions eyes). \n\nThe game is planned to be a singleplayer with a multiplayer edition for teams and solo. \n\nAny comment good or bad is welcome! \nSorry for typos im writing in dark on a mobile. \nThanks in advance! \n\n"
a4c32z,Sci-fi FPS,"#Gameplay:\n\n3 classes:\n\nTitan- Your hard to kill guy with only short range or Melee weapons\n\nMarksman- the guy with all the cool guns and whatnot\n\n3rd class (unnamed)- builder and healer\n\nThe twist on normal games would be that first it’s sort of like titanfall where exploiting every characters’ insane movement is key to actually not die.\n\nAnother would be that none of the classes actually fall into a Damage-Tank-Support category. Sure, they all fit very vague archetypes of those but all of them have similar firepower, it just changes where it comes from.\n\nEach class has their own unique mega ability (like ultimates or supers, I haven’t come up with a unique name) \n\nTitan- You get better speed and way more armour, but your only weapon becomes a massive axe.\n\nMarksman- You get a scope on your gun (no normal guns would ever have scopes or an option to zoom in) and no flinching or speed penalty while scoped. Your gun also deals more damage.\n\n\n3rd class- You get this massive mech that can’t use any of the mobility options but has super high hp and damage.\n\n#Story:\n\nFollowing technological advancement, Earth was plunged into a series of resource wars that left the entire planet scarred and barren. The last few survivors use crippled technology from the golden age to fight over what is left (which is where the maps are)\n\n\nSorry for the rough design when I have time later I’ll polish it and edit it in.\n\n"

a45yup,"Dream Product: ""Nintendo Motif"" (Not necessarily a game, but close enough)","Yeah, I know this post is useless to game devs, but I just want to get this off my chest since I'm tired of my VGM playlist getting ruined and its videos taken down.\n\nAlso, I do specify Nintendo music here (because of my predilection), but this could really apply to any company, or all of them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Introducing Nintendo Motif\n\nAn application where you can purchase video game playlists to listen to as you please.  Spend your money on MotifCredits (say, a dollar for 1000 Credits, or some other highly divisible number), then use these credits to acquire permanent access to any of hundreds of OSTs from Nintendo games of old and new, with new ones being added and made available all the time. (Price varies depending on OST size and age, with newer or iconic ones costing more due to profitability)\n\nIf you already have a 3DS/Switch games, you acquire free access to the playlists to those games.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Bells and Whistles\n\n* You can make custom playlists with as many individual tracks as as you want.  You can play the playlist in shuffled mode or syntactically, and you can choose to loop the playlist or not.\n* You can set a default amount of loops/listen time for every video you add, and manually toggle the amount of loops-listen time per track as you please.  Setting options: 1 loop, 2 loops, 3 loops, 3 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, instantly end track once it finishes, slowly transition out of track once it finishes.\n* Some iconic songs would get remixes that you can buy for some more MotifCredits.  Some examples of remixes are True 8-bit, Stylish 8-bit, A Capella, Orchestrated/Modernized, different soundfont, Techno, Jazzy, etc.\n* For a chunk of MotifCredits, you unlock the remixer tool.  You can use your creativity to make reinstrumentations and remixes of songs in an editor of a  complexity similar to WarioWare D.I.Y.'s, except you have more tracks, a time signature, and can choose how long notes last.  You can use these songs in your playlists and share them with others that purchased the original song.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# QNA\n\n""But Smash Bros. Ultimate already has a feature like this.""\n\nYeah.  It does.  Which makes me sad, since it prolongs the time until Nintendo makes a fully-fledged product/shop like this. I'm talkin' about a HUGE collection of entire video game OSTs, rather than quite a few hand-picked iconic songs and remixes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n""But I can just listen to these songs on YouTube.""\n\nYeah.  Which is illegal and unreliable.  Nintendo should just further prioritize taking those videos down once this market is released.  Maybe they could make a deal with YouTube to improve their copyright detection algorithm on these videos."

a25us1,A Burnout-style racing game in which half of the racers drive in the opposite direction.,"Each deathrace starting line has half of the racers facing the opposite direction. In a 3-lap race, racers would have to face bouts of deadly head-on collisions about 6 times.\n\nAll racing mechanics would be designed around this single concept. Control is tight and immediate. Head-on collisions send both cars straight into the air, so driving behind another car is a safety tactic... while playing chicken with an opposing vehicle (turning at the last second) is a counter-tactic. Crashes are visually spectacular with violent explosions, screen shake and excess debris on the track.\n\nSome tracks would be designed to have straightaways along the expected ""danger zones"". Other tracks make those areas more perilous. For example: Corners that force racers to either the faster inner raceline or the safer outer edge, hills that obscure the oncoming racetrack, branching paths that split into tight corridors, or a combination of any and all of these.\n\nTo raise the tension, seconds before a wave of opposing racers you will get a loud warning of oncoming traffic. **Shit is about to go down.**"
a25gah,A Hunger Games Twitch Collab,"I was recently re-reading my favorite book series of all time while watching some esports on twitch in the background and came up with something that I think would be very fun.\n\nThe game would be a hunger games multiplayer game, with 24 different people on different devices stationed outside the cornucopia until a countdown leads them into a massive killing spree that lasts until there is one survivor. The part that's different about this though, is that there's actually a gamemaker controlling things for his captive twitch audience, and making different events happen to keep things interesting. The watchers could also buy sponsors with bits (Twitch's Currency), making it interactive. Why not even add the stuff before the game like in the books, and let them have an interview, and design outfits to display to the watchers?\n\nThe possibilities are endless. Let me know what you think :)"

Dungeon Village is incredibly good per se, but in some places expandable. In addition, you could tackle some things / tasks in the game differently.\nMultiplayer Mode (Compete and Trade with your fellow Neighbors).\n\n**Graphic Style:**\n\nEither Pixelated or in the style of Banished.\n\n**What you do in the Game:**\n\n\nYou are the Major of a small Quest Hub in a new and exciting MMO Gaming Universe. You dream of being the Major of the biggest and most visited Quest Hub ever! For that, you need Interesting Quests. Create your own Quests to expand your Town in the Direction you want (you want to be a Trade Hub for Crafters? You have to create Quests for Hunting, Mining and so on). The adventurer, which took on Quests, are now visiting your town more often and are fighting, questing, resting, and crafting in your town.\n\n\n**Game Modes:**\n\nSingle Player (KI takes the place of other Players)\nSingle Player Mode has also New Game + and NG++ (+++ and so on), bringing other interesting Adventures\nMultiplayer (Ongoing Game)\n\nI'm open for Critic, Ideas and Offers (especially if you are Interested in making this Game :D)\n"

In the Oasis Kingdom, you can be a king, recruit an army and control castles."," \n\n[https://twitter.com/F4Code](https://twitter.com/F4Code)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the Oasis Kingdom, you can be a king, recruit an army and control castles.\n\ncheck out the game : [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.AlexSW.WarTB](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.AlexSW.WarTB)\n\nIntro\n\nMore than ten unique parts including forest, desert, volcano and more. Each section having multiple castles/buildings to fight over and conquer. There will be challenging battles that will require you to think and plan strategies for each of them. When a soldier dies it’s permanent while you can recruit more you need to be a good commander because your funds are limited. Conquer all the castles on a map to unlock the boss battle and move on to the next map. The Oasis Kingdom is a strategy game with an open map where the player can roam around, attack enemies and siege castles. Battles are turned based with the option to make them automatic.\n\nCharacters\n\nEach character will have different stats such as Hit points, attack range, attack factor, defense factor, movement points, speed, and action points (per turn). This stats will be different depending on the character, for example, a warrior with a shield will have high hit points and defense while a ranger will have a high range, high attack and low defense &amp; hit points. Current controllable characters: warrior, ranger, horseman, and spear-warrior.\n\nTerrain and Levels\n\nThere will be at least ten sections each with more than two conquerable buildings. The terrain will be different for each of them, on some rangers characters will have cover and the advantage while in others. In some instances, the terrain will be interactive and even while changing. In the forest, you will see medieval castles, while in the desert you can see the pyramids. In addition, there will be a secret (easter egg) section.\n\nInventory/Unit System\n\nYou will be able to recruit different units with different skills using gold. You gain gold by defeating enemies and controlling castles. Its permanent death, meaning when a unit dies you will lose it. The difficulty also increases the more castles you own\n\nHeroes - coming soon\n\nThe player will have the ability to pick a hero. These are customizable characters that will have the ability to level up and you will decide how to increase its attributes. In addition, they will have additional skills to power up your army.\n\nwhat do YOU think?"

a1vtax,"A planet colonization game, but with the entire Sol System","There are a good chunk of planet colonization games. We have Anno 2205, Planetbase, and Surviving Mars. Though these games are very good, I feel there's a lot of planets in our system that are typically ignored in gaming. So what if instead of a planet colonization game focusing on a selection of planets, how about all the planets?\n\nBasically, this game will allow the player to setup colonies on other planets, other moons, and even dwarf planets. Want to build a colony on Ceres or Charon? Go for it! Wanna make a colony ""on"" Neptune or Saturn? Sure! Wanna send people to Io or Venus on a potential suicide mission? Why not!\n\nOf course, our planets are fairly diverse. As such, each planet will have varying difficulties and would focus on given elements. Here are some examples.\n- Mercury for example is a very temperature extreme planet, so it's important to focus on thermal control as a whole.\n- Planets like Venus would require a focus on just cooling down your colony whilst planets like Triton or Titan would focus on heating.\n- Gas planets don't have a proper surface, so colonies will play differently since they would basically be low orbiting space stations.\n- Io has a lot of volcanic activity, so the player should stay on alert and be able to evacuate colonists from areas during eruptions.\n- Charon is fairly small, so you would have limited room to expand.\n- Luna (Moon), Phobos, Deimos, Hyperion, and other similar planets have no atmosphere and little gravity, making oxygen production a priority. These planets would also be more susceptible to meteor strikes and without an atmosphere to hamper the impact, they would do more damage to structures than normal.\n\nIn terms of resources, I feel it would play similar to Anno 2205 where each planet would have different resources and structures. Some planets would focus on harvesting resources, Others would focus on science production, Some could act as temporary homes, trading hubs, tourism, and so on.\n\nWhat would you add to this idea? What do you guys think?"
a1ve69,A steampunk game in which you climb colossal contraptions to repair them while they're still moving.,"I know what you're thinking: ""Steampunk Shadow of Colossus?"" Well, sort of.\n\nInstead of killing colossi, however, you're climbing all over giant mechanized vehicles, canvas-winged machines and steam-engine blimps to fix them. You're a steampunk mechanic. And instead of a vast and empty landscape, the game is set in an bustling steampunk city crowded with monorails, metallic skyscrapers and automated factories.\n\nAutomation has led to a mass exodus. Citizens left the metropolis to live in comfortable suburbs and enjoy a universal basic income. A handful of critical personnel stayed behind to keep it running, but you're the only one to *move in* from a small town because it's been your dream to work on those beautiful giant automatons.\n\n****\n\nClimbing is pretty straightforward: You can walk-on and slide-down flat surfaces, but you can't grip them. You can grip and climb on any *corner* surfaces, so long as your feet aren't dangling straight down. This means edges and seams are your best climbing routes. The contraptions you climb have lots of moving, rotating, twisting and tilting parts so you'll want prevent yourself from ending up on the underside.\n\nYour backpack has collapsible canvas wings to glide down. You also have a short-range grappling plunger to use on flat surfaces. The grapple plunger doesn't wind back, so you'll have to swing to safety when you use it. You can also use the plunger to cross short flat surfaces if there's nothing to grip (much like the climbing piton in Uncharted 4).\n\nThere's room for depth here. Sometimes you'll need to slide down a huge flat surface, use the plunger to stop in the middle, and wait for the machine to turn so you slide down in a different direction. Or wait until the surface is fully inverted and slide down the rope to swing to a new area.\n\n****\n\nThe basic premise came from R2D2 wing walking in Episode 1 to repair his fighter while under attack. It reminded me of grappling on huge vehicles in Just Cause 3, except instead of stealing them you would be repairing them. That led to imagining huge machines with flat surfaces and sharp corners...

a1ubd3,Smaller Battle Royale - Jenga/ Rainbow six,"Picture a tall building, or a construction site, or some other multi-floored map with destructible environments.      \n\nSet pieces or dynamic ones like rainbow six doesn't matter too much. The idea anyway is as you fight the area you are holed up in gets less useful.      \n\nAnyway, this might make Battle royales faster and naturally move players together thanks to collapsing floors, fires, lack of cover, falling debris and what not.       \n\nLower floors get safer as time goes on and so people need to push down.\n\nMaybe police snipers outside who will take pop shots if you linger in an open area too long.

a1sczz,looking for mobile game idea or partner,"Hi guys,\n\ncall me Franz.\n\nI am currently looking for some ideas for a new mobile game. Or might a partner to create one.\n\nI am personally mostly interestet in simulation or management games. Which also go deep into detail. So normaly my thoughts fly around that genre and I get stuck with thinking.\n\n**Most importat is the fact that I have no interest to make a game which core is based on violance, killing, shooting, betraying or theft.**\n\nmore to myself and skills:\n\nI program in Unity3D  with C#\n\nI know PHP and SQL for any serverside backend \n\nI know some 3D (modeling, shading, simple animations (no characters))\n\nI know how to use and edit with Photoshop and Illustrator **BUT** I am not an Artist\n\nI am native german and can create assets or text in german\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe last point is what hinders me to make like an RPG story telling game because I would not feel comfortable creating story text in english. Depending on the content translation cost can scale big.\n\nRegarding graphics or animation I can not go triple A title and I am also limited time wise by my fulltime job.\n\nAnd that takes me to the business side of things. I do want to monetize the game be it consumables ingame products or advertisement. So this should be considered inside the idea alwell. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust send me a text or comment if you wanna get intouch with me, I am not going to steal anyones Idea and go big.\n\nRather I am looking for partners do bundle up power and ideas.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ncheers Franz\n\n&amp;#x200B;"
a1pgjw,Assassins Creed Strategy Game,"So if you are a fan of Assassins Creed or just looking through game trailers or Assassins Creed based videos on Youtube. Then you would notice something called Assassins Creed: Rebellion. And out of curiosity, I downloaded it on my phone and after playing it a while, I have to say...It's pretty fun and has an interesting idea that I think could be explored more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, so my idea for an AC strategy game would be a mix of AC Brotherhood, X-Com, and Door Kickers. So you would recruit assassins like in Brotherhood. Pick who you want on your missions and their gear. Then, finally, it would be a top-down view like Door Kickers, where you can pause and think of your approach to assassinate your target, get info, or just spy on Templars. And of course like in Assassins Creed you would be able to parkour. That's all I could muster up for a game idea but it's whatever."

a1jso5,Battlefield style online shooter that takes place in a fictional world,"When I saw the controversy for Battlefield V (amputee soldiers, female soldiers, soldiers of varying racial background) it made me think ""they should just make the game set in a alternate world with its own history, but keep all the WWII weapons"". Sort of like Ace Combat's \[Strangereal\]([http://acecombat.wikia.com/wiki/Strangereal](http://acecombat.wikia.com/wiki/Strangereal)), but in the 40s. There can be nations based of of real life nations from our history. A democracy, an empire/monarchy, a fascist republic, a communist nation, an Asian style empire, etc. The player can create their character, then they will choose which army to join. \n\nEach army has their own weapons and vehicles. Since this is a fictional world you can take some liberties in the weapons. They can range from pre-WWI weapons such as lever actions and bolt action rifles, to early automatic weapons such as the MP-18, then to the WWII weapons we all know and love, then the highest grade weapons will be early Cold War guns like the AK-47 and M-14.\n\nCampaigns will be held over a large continent where wins/losses will take you to different maps, closer to the opponents capital city.\n\n&amp;#x200B;"
a1gv4n,Soviet Corpse Manager,"**Genre:** Arcade (unrealistic) management simulator.\n\n**Name:** I imagine the title would be **Soviet Corpse Manager**, but the in-game title screen would have something like the following title.\n\n#People's Workplace Hazard Director\n\n##Story\n\nThe beautiful southern nation of Paraguay has elected to give socialism a try. Dictator Galeano's five-year plan has decided to invest heavily in the unobtainium industry. This industry has a notorious and irreparable high workplace death rate, but the people of Sovoguay are willing to do anything *for the motherland*. Which is socialist rhetoric for ""or else"".\n\nThe gloriously efficient Sovoguayan government is able to replace any dead workers nearly instantly, but workers nearly always die in a position that prevents further use of the workstation. Which is why there was instituted the People's Workplace Hazard Ministry (MRTP), which is the industrial corpse-removal arm. Your job as a MRTP director is to make sure that dead workers are replaced quickly enough to maintain production quotas. If you cannot, your employment will be *terminated*.\n\n##Gameplay##\n\nYou oversee a large factory. There are two kinds of employees in this factory: *workers* and *functionaries*.\n\nThe *workers* are the factory workers, who will autonomously work their jobs. They will also frequently die while doing so. The factory is large enough that the average worker can survive for some days, but there are still a couple of deaths per real-time minute. You have no control over the workers.\n\nThe *functionaries* are employees of the MRTP. Their job is to carry corpses from out of their workstations when an employee dies. They will not move without being told, and you must give them the task to carry any corpses you see on the factory.\n\nYou will notice corpses by the fact that they stopped working, along with death animations if you can catch them happening. Then you will click on a functionary (or two of them, if the dead worker is too fat, which is rare) and on the dead worker, and they will carry it away and escort his or her replacement to the workstation.\n\nYou will also have a standard-issue **rifle**, with which you can shoot any people you see on the factory. Usually this is counter-productive, since it only means more corpses to manage. However, this is the only known *treatment* in Sovoguay for certain *behavioural illnesses* (status conditions) which your functionaries and workers can get. Some of those are:\n\n- **Chronic Slowness:** Functionaries with this condition will work slower than normal. You will have to watch their moving animation to notice. They also have a chance (25%, say) to pass on this condition to the replacement workers they bring to the stations.\n- **Ancient Jewish Priesthood:** Functionaries with this condition will not touch any corpses directly, because they must maintain Jewish ritual purity. They are easy to notice, therefore, because they fail to follow orders. However, not so much in the later levels, when you may have the aid of *forklifts* to carry the corpses. They will drive those forklifts without issue, but you may still notice them because they will also fail to work at all on the Sabbath.\n- **Right Wing Rebellious Ideology:** These counter-revolutionary infiltrates wish to dismantle the Sovoguayan dictatorship and bring back the old Paraguayan government. They will work as normal, but any workers they replace will start sabotaging the workplace. You will notice rebellious workers because their working animation plays backwards from normal.\n\nGame play will get harder as the game progresses. Workers will die more in certain seasons because of famine and plague, and quotas will increase. There may be a **mission mode** with increasingly harder objectives to meet, and also an **arcade mode**, in which you must try to survive as long as you can in your job as quotas increase over time and conditions get harder."

Trading, planning, transporting, etc, all of that is insanely fun for me. For example, having to trade resources with another player/NPC and allocate those resources and plan the logistics of transporting and then commencing the transport. \n\nIt's pretty weird, but are there any games where it's essentially that besides Elite Dangerous and Truck Simulator? Something lightweight that could even be played on a phone. \n\nIf not, that may be an idea for myself to make, or someone before me. "

a1aogo,A survival sandbox multiplayer game that encourages heirarchy and cooperative competition between players.,"Ok, so I've had an idea for a game that I've been juggling around in my head. Originally,  it started as two ideas that I incorporated into each other.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBasically, it'd be a massively multiplayer survival-sandbox game. Players would build structures and search for resources to survive and thrive. Communication between players would be via a local voice chat, so only people in a certain radius could hear you. Maybe have it adjust this radius according to how loud you speak into the microphone so you can whisper or shout. Players also interact by trading items and maybe have gestures they could do to each other.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe resources would be balanced in a certain way so that players have incentives to work together and form heirarchies in order to get them more efficiently. These heirarchies wouldn't be an actual mechanic in the game like the guilds systems in MMORPGs, but social structures organically created by the players. You might have to consult with a Machiavellian or Hobbesian scholar to figure out exactly how to do this, but as far as I can think, you'd have basic things be common enough for players to not need to fight over them, but also better things that are extremely rare and make the game easier, although a skilled player shouldn't need them to get by, even with competition against players who have it. I've also considered the idea of having stacks for inventory, where you must take out the most recent item you put in before taking out other ones. This would make large inventories hard to manage, and thus hopefully players will start trusting each other to carry stuff, or offer deals for it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd now, for the fun part: What happens if you don't survive, and end up dying in the game?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis world has 5 realms to it, numbered 0-4, where the players exist, along with NPC animals and such.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou start out in a random one of them. They could have different themes, different resource distributions, terrain generation, etc. to make it interesting and help you quickly identify which one you're on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen you die in, say, realm 4, you go down to 3. Die in 3, go to 2, etc. You also lose your items when you die.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen you kill something, whether a player or an NPC creature, you get a point that you can spend to go up or down through the realms. So with 2 points on level 1, you can go up to level 3, or spend only 1 point to go up to 2 or down to 0. You keep your items when you do this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you die in realm 0, you go back to the realm you spawned in, but become a spectre.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA spectre cannot kill or be killed. It cannot interact with the terrain, except for picking up the items of deceased players. They can be seen by other players, but not heard, and only interacted with through trading. The specture has the option of trading an item or number of items to a ""living"" player in exchange for being revived, becoming a ""living"" player, but the other player has to accept the risk of you immediately turning on them. This is where having allies and being trusted/respected really comes in handy."

He is planning on killing her.\n\nGameplay\nYou must find a way out of the house. You run around looking for keys and hidden paths. Avoid the crazy guy and solve puzzles. You need to pay attention to the puzzles or you may flip a wrong switch or hit a wrong button and get a spike through the head or some other gruesome death.\n\nThat's my idea.

Each level is themed, for example it could be a cemetry with a demon as a final boss, and the waves consist of witches, skeletons, bats, and much more, or it could be a medival themed level with soldiers, archers, trebuchets, knights, and a general as a final boss. Each level has a finite number of waves that you'll have to beat in order to make the boss spawn of course, and if it's important to note : enemys spawn from all/random directions.\n\n**But here is the catch :** \n\nAt the end of every few waves, you gain ""knowledge"" which you could spend to get some new skills, or upgrade the one you already have, and even upgrade some stats like HP, Magic power, Movement speed.... \n\n**OR** \n\nSpend that knowledge to place some buildings around the area, like towers which help you fend off incoming enemies, portals which periodically spawn some allies, a building that generates knowledge periodically, walls to protect you and your buildings and much more... But be careful as these can be destroyed leaving you vulnerable to stronger enemies without having enough power to fend them off yourself. \n\nBecome a powerful mage and have a heavily combat focused gameplay or play as a strategist and build your own empire, there will be so many possibilities but the choices you make will have a bigger impact as you progress further into the level.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI honestly think i might start coding this soon, what do you guys think ?  \n\n&amp;#x200B;"

There would be no other strings attached. However, you can only stay in said period of time for 24 in-game hours, at which point you must return to the present.\n\nYou have different skills or careers you can assign your character before you travel each time, such as if you're traveling to WWII era you can be an ace pilot and rule the skies, or if you travel to ancient Rome you can spec into intelligence to have a lovely chat with some philosophers.\n\nThe point of this would be to either better shape your present time, or completely ruin it.

a13jrl,A wholesome slice-of-life dating sim in which all your love interests have at least one glaring personality flaw.,"Let me first reveal the plot twist before describing the game:\n\nYou are presented with several love interests. Each love interest has both positive and negative personality traits (except one who seems to have no redeeming qualities).\n\nTwo thirds of the way in, you learn you are inside a dream world. *You are inside the mind of your spouse.* Doctors are using an experimental machine to save your spouse from a coma and you are chosen to go in. The doctors warned you that you'll struggle to recover your own memory while inside but you went in anyway.\n\nBut which love interest is the true personality of your spouse?\n\n### The Gameplay\n\nThe game plays like a classic top-down RPG minus combat. You and your love interests are neighboring business owners in a small dreamy town. As you get to know them, you learn their quirks, their likes/dislikes and what they need in a relationship. Some want help fixing their problems while others might want someone to just listen to their problems. Some want gifts, some want attention and others just want emotional support. Each romantic interest has a specific key role you must fill to be their partner.\n\nYou *can* have multiple partners at a time.\n\nThe game doesn't end when you start dating one of the romantic interests. It's not about making partners, but about keeping them. Getting them to confess was just the start. The real meat of the game for each of the love interests is in *maintaining* a stable relationship.\n\nOnce the in-game calendar reaches a certain date, you are both kicked out. Whichever personality/personalities you were able to save will ""take over"" your spouse. ...But that was only the normal ending.\n\n### Okay, I lied about giving away the twist at the start. Here's the actual story twist:\n\n**ALL** the personalities are your spouse's. Once the game ends, you learn your spouse had a mental health disorder that they had controlled for a long time with medication. However, the medication failed in the end and caused a break. Now you're trying to recover all the resulting fragments of your spouse's psyche. Each of the personalities (along with their merits and faults) all belong to your spouse. The scientist doctors tell you their machine has enough juice for one last jump. You want your spouse to be whole, so you start another attempt. In gameplay terms, this is NewGame+.\n\nThe perfect ending is when you save all the characters (including the character who on the surface was only unlikable) meaning you accept all of your spouses traits (including the faults)."
a0zmea,A deceptive dungeon crawler that acts as an analogy for addiction and escapism,"This is an idea I've had for a while, ""Deep Down"". Its kinda a lot to explain, so I'll walk you through the game from start to finish.\n\n**The Game**\n\nThe game starts off with you, the nameless protagonist, chopping wood in a forest at night. You are approached by a demoness. She bluntly states that she's a devil from the underworld, but the game holds a lighthearted tone. Like her being a demon is nothing more than a stylistic choice. She tells you about a fantastical dungeon that holds amazing treasures at the bottom, and offers to guide you on an adventure to the bottom of the dungeon. She leaves, and the cutscene ends. From here, there is only one button you can press. A button to go to the dungeon and begin the actual game. The player can take no other action and will continue to watch their character chop wood until they press the button. This might all sound trivial, but it’ll come back later.\n\nThen the game actually starts. It’s a pretty traditional top down hack and slash. The demon acts as a Navi type character who explains how to play, exposits lore, describes monsters, and is generally the only real character in the game, since the protagonist is silent. The dungeon is split into floors, with each floor being a level. Everytime you beat a floor, you jump down a trapdoor and enter the next level, without being able to go back up to previous floors. Everytime you descend, the Demon heals you to full health(there's no natural health regen). She always hangs out at the beginning of the floor. Anytime you die, she brings you back to life, functioning as a standard respawn system with infinite lives. As you play, you’ll get more equipment, unlock upgrades, standard adventure/RPG mechanics.\n\nOkay, at this point, the game starts showing its true colors. The player starts finding notes from previous adventurers. Up until now, the game has been very colorful and whimsical, but these notes are a bit more grim. They subtly warn the player about a few things. That the demon should not be trusted, and that reaching the bottom of the dungeon is not the true goal. As the player gets deeper, the game gradually changes. The demon begins acting more suspiciously, the monsters become more fantastical and whimsical, and the note’s warnings become more obvious. They also begin giving hints on an in-game mechanic that allows the player to climb back up to previous floors. Something along the line of equipping specific armors, activating items in a certain order, etc. Something specific enough that it would take a bit of time to figure out.\n\nOnce the player figures out the trick and attempts to climb back up, the demon drops her act. She states that she has been luring you down, and that climbing back up is near impossible. As soon as you enter the previous floor, the game changes drastically. The aesthetic changes from being colorful and whimsical to dreary and dark, replacing the fantastical creatures with uncanny mutants. But more importantly, the demon is no longer following you. Up until this point, she's been effectively the only character, making the game extremely lonely without her. You can continue to climb backwards through the levels, going from the exit point to the entrance, with the levels being altered with new enemies/traps/items. However, the game is MUCH more difficult now. Without the demon, you no longer heal at the end of every level, and when you die, you don’t respawn at the beginning of the level. You respawn where SHE’S waiting, at the lowest floor you’ve been to. From here, the goal of the game becomes clear, return to the first floor and exit the dungeon, but the deeper you went into the dungeon, the harder it is to escape. Once you finally escape, there’s no fanfare or epic treasure. Your character takes his axe, and continues chopping wood. From here, the game returns to exactly how it started. Your character chops wood and you only one have one button, “return to the dungeon”.\n\nBut what if the player continues going down the dungeon? They will eventually hit a point where the game just blatantly tells them to turn around and how to do it, but they can choose to ignore it. The demon starts being more honest, explaining that you’ll never be able to leave. At the last few floors the game becomes trivially easy. Once you hit the long awaited bottom floor, there's no treasure. It’s just a dark room with some skeletons in it. Once you hit this floor, the player can take no actions, all they can do is sit there and listen to the demon talk to herself/the protagonist indefinitely. The game effectively soft locks, forcing the player to delete their save data to start over.\n\n**Thoughts**\n\nThe protagonist is a blank canvas character, just a stand in for the player. But the demon and her dungeon can represent a lot of different things. Drug usage, compulsive gaming, porn addiction, depression, etc. The game’s main structure mimics the downward spiral and delusion caused by addiction. There’s an initial red flag that the whole situation is evil, but just about every player will ignore it. Everything looks wonderful from the inside, but the warnings from prior victims betray it. Only by trying to escape can you see it’s true nature and its grasp on you. And escape doesn’t grant you a wonderful reward, it leaves you right back where you started, with the constant opportunity to relapse.\n\nThe game also acts as satire, with the dungeon representing the game itself. It criticizes fantasy adventures as being a tool for escapism that disconnects people from reality, while being a fantasy adventure itself. It warns against obsessive waifuism, while desperately trying to get players to like the game’s own demoness, and the only way to win the game is to stop playing it. It has the same sort of spirit as games like Undertale or Oneshot, where they criticize the player for even playing it.\n\nThe main twist was something I came up with after watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwV_mA2cv_0) (as a side note, great watch. Totally recommend Game Maker’s Toolkit). He talks about a dilemma that mystery games have: how do you prompt a player for a solution without inadvertently giving them the answer? So I thought to myself, what if the game didn’t TELL you it was a mystery game? The player doesn’t just have to find the answer, they need to find the QUESTION. The game rewards observant and clever players, since the trek back is easier if you put the pieces together faster. Additionally, learning to not trust the demon can give you advantages, as she sometimes tries to trick the player (“Oh, don’t worry about hoarding potions, you’ll always have me to heal you!”)"
a0z7bp,An new Outlast 1 DLC where you are a patient of Mount Massive Asylum that survived the experiments without going insane and now you need to escape and go back to your family,"Lomg title, but that´s it. I know it would be really akward for Red Barrels to do a new DLC for  Outlast 1 bow, but... that´s just a idea I wanted to share with you all here,"
a0yt19,A different approach to a MOBA,"My problem with mobas is quite simple, since there are always a lot of variety of heroes to choose from and to learn. there's never room for variety in terms of map design. League of Legends have so many heroes but once you learn the few ones that you like, playing the same map all the time gets boring. But there is no room for new maps because they cannot risk to be very innovative otherwise it may turn chaotic in terms of balance. Plus, the idea of having 200 champions and 30 maps to learn would be overwhelming for a new player.\n\nMy idea for a moba would have these characteristics.\n\nIt's top down view like League of Legends and Dota.\n\nThere goal is to destroy the enemy base, with lanes and turret defense.\n\nIt is NOT hero based, instead there would be 7 or 8 classes you can choose from. With this, balance should be a lot easier and there would be more room to develop different variety of maps.\n\nInstead of making 3 modes (3v3, 5v5 and 8v8). there would be 2 modes 4v4 and 6v6 so there's less to work with and neither mode feels too big or too small.\n\nMinion kills give EXP, standing next to a minion when it dies gives 25% of the EXP, it doesn't give gold. Instead of a gold system, items are rewarded when securing objectives.  Some items would give stats boost, others will give you abilities, others will be weapons. Different sets of items will be avaliable on different maps so each map has it's unique experience.\n\nInstead of teleport items or spells there would be vehicles or other mechanism of transportation that would be avaliable every 5 or 6 minutes. Depending on the maps, some maps might have tanks that, others might have helicopters. Maybe a vehicle to make 4 man ganks.  \n\n\nThe goal is to make a game easy to get into, with different game experience based on different maps. It wont be necessary to release constant updates to balance champions, just release new maps instead to keep things fresh."
a0yry1,Thoughts on This Story Summary?," So I was digging through my files and found this story summary I wrote for a game that was being worked on. The lead developer had AAA and AA experience and had a small team together with what was at least a rough playable demo to get the idea across. The game was going to be a 2.5D puzzle platformer with some combat.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI joined the team to help out with the story telling. At this point, nothing story related had been done besides an summary and a rough outline. I really didn't care for the summary that much and thought it could be better so I went ahead and wrote a new one. I'm not saying I had anything to do with it because it was probably a few days later that I shared the summary I wrote but the lead had completely disappeared. After a few weeks of him being gone the team started dropping out, as well as myself (quite surprised they kept going that long to be honest).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, so here I am reading this summary I pointlessly wrote probably close to a year ago and I realized that I actually am pretty into the story and where I was going with it. It's not overly original but I really thought I had what was leading up to a surprisingly fleshed out world. Unfortunately with the game being dead I was never able to work with the other developers in actually flesh out the rest of the story into a playable experience. I was just curious about all of your thoughts and was looking for some feedback on the story. I won't actually do anything with it myself anymore so if somebody is interested in using the idea let me know.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSTORY SUMMARY: ""ROBYRT""\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPrologue\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe world is controlled by corporations. The government acts as a puppet in most cases. Greed and power is now what guides our civilization. Those without the money to afford even the bare necessities are left to rot away in the slums. Corporations vie for the public eye, doing whatever they can to gain the upper hand. None is more guilty of this than The Vondura Corporation (Vondur is Icelandic for evil). The Vondura Corporation is a robotics company that has a long history of performing malicious and illegal acts, some more serious than others though none have been linked to The Vondura Corporation or it's CEO Martin Vondura.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMany corporations, and even some consumers, use an advanced security system called “GATES” (potential acronym if something can be thought of). “GATES” is a security system that uses a series of barriers in place that prevent physical and digital entities to pass without the correct access code. “GATES” has proven to be such a successful system that it has been adopted by nearly all corporations and public services through the world. Entire cities use “GATES” to secure and control the access to water, electricity, food, and any other item that has a value attached to it.\n\nMain\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Vondura Corporation has developed technology capable of bypassing “GATES,” becoming the first to do so. Vondura launches a new program in secret to develop drones that can take advantage of this newfound technology. Within this program, they tinker with AI and have unparalleled success. They launch Jasmyn, the first AI robot to take advantage of the technology. While technically an AI is able to think for themselves, restrictions and motivators are put in place to guide the AI toward Vondura's goal. Jasmyn is much more capable than the drones previously developed. With faster reflexes and the ability to think for itself, Jasmyn becomes the ultimate weapon in corporate espionage. Vondura knows they can do better and begins work on Robyrt. A series two AI meant to eclipse Jasmyn in it's abilities.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBefore The Vondura Corporation is able to finish work on Robyrt, the government launches an investigation due to the mounting evidence of their work along with a massive spike in market control due to corporate espionage. Vondura cancels the program, erasing any history of the drones, Jasmyn and Robyrt. Jasmyn and the unfinished Robyrt have their drives wiped, are dismantled, and cast into the slums junkyard to be used for parts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLiving in the slums is an ex Vondura engineer, fired from his job and smeared after refusing to take part in the companies malicious deeds. The engineer (name can be determined later) spends his days scrounging for parts, repairing whatever the inhabitants from the slums bring him, making just enough to get by. Weeks... perhaps months after The Vondura Corporations investigation has ended with no results, the engineer comes across a small bot. The bot is rusted and brittle. Yet, across the side in small letters is a very distinguishable “ROBYRT.” The engineer takes the bot home, hoping to scavenge some valuable parts from the poor thing. What he finds is more than he ever expected.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom this point, the engineer would repair Robyrt and reactivate him. With Robyrts memory wiped, the restrictions and motivators alongside it, Robyrts is just a fresh mind. But there is this piece of him left, a memory from the past that will drive him to discover what he is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe engineer could also find Jasmyn in order to enable cooperative play."
a0y7z9,A Real-Time Strategy game where each team is based on specific genres of Pop-Culture.,"So it's like Starcraft or Halo Wars, But the teams are based on different movie/video game/book generes! It has teams like Traditional Monsters (Vampires, Mummies, Giant Spiders), Fantasy Races (Hydra, Griffin, Giant) , Zombies (Horde, Bone Blade Horde, Mutated Wolf Pack), and The Hive (Warrior Drone, Bombardier Beetle, Royal Jelly Transporter) just to name the more interesting ones. We also have Humans, Aliens, Robots, and Magic users/creatures as 4 others.\n\nEach team also has a special unit type which has their own properties. Like the Robot's Upgrader, which has a tier list of units that it transforms into, one by one. Or the Alien's Cloaker, which can temporally turn invisible to the enemy.\n\nThere are also Heroes. Heroes are unique to each team, but can have only 1 at a time. Like the Human's General Matt, who can call an airstrike, or the Magic's Merlin's Apprentice, who can create portals for most units to go through.  \n\nI also plan to design a campaign for each team, explaining their motives, and how they got to this connected world.\n\n# What I Need:\n\nI would like help with a good, interesting title, and some ideas for teams."
a0ttv4,Business management game,"Players start with one business that produces income every second only while the player is active.\n\nBusinesses can be upgraded to produce more income, players can buy and sell businesses.\n\nWhen a business reaches a certain level, the owner can issue stocks. Dividend yield is 2%.\n\nPlayers can issue more stocks according to their hourly income. Shares can be traded between players or sold to bots.\n\nPlayers can loan money from banks owned by other players or bots, maximum tenure for a loan is 50 days, interest rate is set by players (10-25%), 10% for bot banks.\n\nBusinesses can have franchises (lvl requirement)\n\nThe price of a franchise is set by players. Franchise owners keep 5-40% of the income (amount set by franchiser)\n\nThe player who owns more than 50% of a company's shares becomes owner\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat would you add or change about the game?"
a0t0ob,Meats vs Alters,"This idea came to me when I saw someone mention a spawning base in another idea post. I thought, ""What if it's not the main player respawning?"" \n\nThe game is a fps, multiplayer ideally (but not too many). Each player has one ""meat"" character and an endless supply of ""alters"" - artificial, spawned fighting machines. The goal of the game is to take out the other player's ""meat"" which is hidden somewhere. Your only clue initially is by where the Alters spawn. You can kill the Alters over and over, but until you take out the Meat, the game goes on.\n\nEach player has a base where they keep safe their Meat body. The bases are unknown at game start. The trick is to find them.\n\nA player can either control an Alter or the Meat. An Alter can only be controlled while the Meat is in base. A player can control and fight with the Meat - useful if the base is infiltrated - but once the Meat is killed, that's it.\n\nSort of like a normal PvP game, but the game doesn't end until the others figure out where you live..."
a0szpi,"A (mobile?) auction game with many collectables, infinite replayability, and all mind games.","I've never seen an auction mobile game before but, now that I think about it, one probably exists somewhere.  Forgive me.  \n\n\nAnyway, this would be one of those mindless mobile games, but it's just something I want to exist.\n\n\nThe gameplay is simple: You get matched with 3 other players, and your goal is to bid the most amount of money to win the collectable everyone else is bidding for, as with real life auctions.\n\nThe beauty comes with the amount of different match ups you can have: You be fighting for limited time, limited supply, or otherwise rate collectables.  You could be in an auctional bidding or in a sealed envelope bidding (which is where each player puts in a number to bid once, and no one can see each other's biddings).  The winner is randomly chosen to pay the first, second, third, or fourth highest biddings, or maybe all players have to pay what they bid regardless of whether they win or not.  Each bid could come with a randomized fine, encouraging you to bid less often and more meaningfully.\n\n\nImagine multiplying these different factors togehter.  Do the math, and there's endless possibilities.\n\n\nAlso factor in that everyone will view the collectable at stake at different perspective, such as whether or not they have it, or whether or not they need it to complete a set, for example.  This will change their bidding tactics."

a0rs2o,Comedy based first-person hack-n-slash RPG,"Comedy based first-person hack-n-slash RPG\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBasically, it's a normal RPG with adventuring, questing, looting, and sales, with a bit of a twist. Your skills don't start out at level 1. Every skill should have major drawbacks at low levels, but there should be no level requirement for use. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSwordsmanship, for example can have you knocking things over, randomly, and the level of the sword impacts it. You'll end up dropping your weapon, or swinging it, only to let it slip out of your hands, directly above you, forcing you to dodge. That can kill you, your enemy, or some poor fool who walked in at the wrong time. The higher the level of the sword, the heavier/bigger it should be. At lower skill levels, it will slow you down while sheathed, slow you even worse when it isn't, as it will be dragging behind you, and you'll be slowly, awkwardly swinging it at enemies.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLow armor skill should have the same effect of encumbrance. It should slow you, or even cause you to fall over from time to time, and bump into people, and things, knocking them over.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMagic should sputter and die if the spell is low enough in level. Higher levels can be truly devastating, but it's effects should be based on that spell. Failing to cast a healing spell, for example, could poison everyone around you, or literally wake the dead. A fireball spell can sputter out, fly in a random direction, send a healing spell at your enemy (who should thank you for the good deed), or blast a crater around you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThievery is the one that got me laughing at this idea. Imagine pick-pocketing someone in a crowded bar... ""aaAAACHOOOoo!!"" And the entire bar suddenly notices you, and tries to apprehend you. Burglary can have you falling out windows, falling in through windows,... onto formerly sleeping people... or stepping on a cat's tail, and alerting the neighborhood.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCrafting should give you some useless items in the beginning, and some slightly dangerous, but useful items as you go, like a chair for your base, that can fall apart as you sit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDo I even have to mention the side effects of crappy alchemy skills? I'm thinking poisons, burping potions, random twitches, and poisonous, or lethal gas, which effects anyone too close... lol\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSmithing might be funny... besides hitting your hand with the hammer, you could end up with a crooked sword, or something.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOf course, this isn't how the entire game should be played, just as you are at lower levels. What would also be interesting is if those around you, enemies included, had varying skill levels, with the same drawbacks, as well."
a0rqv9,Dystopian shooter masquerading as an animal crossing clone,"Hey, all! Created a Reddit account just to post this!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is a bit of a weird idea, and I'm not entirely sure how it might turn out, but I was thinking of one of those games that are pretending to be one thing but are actually another, similar to Doki Doki Literature Club, for example.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe basic idea is that the game is supposed to be a first-person shooter in the vein of Half-Life. A global oppressive government exists and is ruling humanity with an iron fist, and it's up to some nerd with a gun to overthrow them by shooting everybody to death. Somehow, not quite certain, the guys up top have figured out that the player character is coming and that there is no possible way they can stop him. So instead, they decide to pacify him. Before the story can get a move on, they shuttle the player character off to a Truman Show-like town off in the wilderness and decide to convince the player that they are NOT playing a violent first-person shooter, but a social building game similar to Animal Crossing or Harvest Moon.\n\nThey send clever actors and brainwashed citizens to work a quirky cast and convince the player to build them homes, plant them food and make friends with them. They set up arbitrary barriers around the town to keep the player contained and do everything possible to keep them from any form of violence at all. No weapons, no sharp tools, vegetarian diets, all that sort of thing. The player must be kept docile and compliant. He must continue to build homes. He might even be useful to the continued oppression of humanity beyond the borders of the town, especially if they take up manufacturing or something like that.\n\nThe thing is, the player will continue to advance and push the boundaries of what they're allowed to do. With each new discovery the government has to scramble to cover up holes and keep up appearances. From the player's perspective, they're playing a game with an odd sense of humor that capitalizes on the dissonance between setting and gameplay, but as they progress things start to feel out of place and the disconnect becomes harder and harder to rationalize. I'm not entirely sure how this might climax or what the player might do after the big reveal, but I think it'd be a fun mystery and have a lot of room for commentary, humor or whatever else the developer might want to throw in there.\n\nThere really isn't that much more to it, but I feel like with a bit of refinement I may be on to something. Tell me what you think!"
a0qxi6,A true perma-death game,"So i had this idea for a while, but what if there was a game where when you die it isn't the normal perma-death of ""Oh you died time to make a new save file."" But rather, ""Oh you died, now you will never be able to play again."" The game keeps track of who you are and everything about you so there's no cheating death. Once you die you are locked out, forever. The worst part about it is the gamme tries everything it can to make sure you die. It can range from a short game to an ultra long difficult game, but once you die it's over and there's no coming back in. No spectator mode to watch other players try to beat it. The only spectator mode you could have is watching someone play on YouTube or Twitch. The idea can also be expanded upon in any way shape or form."

a0myh4,Online DnD-like adventure game,"Imagine as the DM you had a repertoire of props, items, enemies, etc. you could use to create worlds and levels for your players to explore in 3D. The DM would have an aerial view of their world that they create beforehand and be able to manipulate it on the fly. The players would play in first or third person and the rules would be up to the DM. \n\nThere could be all different kinds of campaigns created: medieval, sci-fi, modern, etc. It would all depend on what the DM had available for props. There could be a few premade worlds so DMs didn't always have to create their own. Community made worlds, mods, and props could be shared like Steam workshop. Eventually you could even have AI DMs controlling the game.\n\nPlayers could rate DMs on how fun they were and vice-versa. There would be a lobby system to play with friends or find a server. \n\nThere's so much that could be done in a game like this. Does something like this already exist? I think it would be crazy fun."

It  would be setted up so if you get a correct ending ( where you character  becames what he is today ) you'd get some real life money.

These items are not like most mobas, they'll be upgrades to your existing equipment, and talking about equipment, there won't be heroes, instead you choose 1 of 7 or 8 classes. Different classes would be stronger according to the items avaliable in each map so each map has an unique experience.  \nThere will be lanes, and there will be a central objective (Destroy the enemy base).\n\nThe could be a campaign I don't really know but the game is based off a fictional universe called The Syncronverse.

a0jprf,Base management - You manage a gas station that is actually just a front for your secret surveillance base.,"My idea (TL;DR): You are the manager of a gas station that is a front for a government surveillance operation.\n\nHey everyone, I was thinking this morning about a fun game idea that I would love to see made. I played Evil Genius as a kid and really enjoyed the whole secret-lair concept, but I think it's a genre that hasn't had a good successor since then.\n\nI have some ideas on the game mechanics that I'll share here, if anyone finds it useful. As the gas station manager, buy land, build pumps, hire employees, manage emergencies (i.e. robbery, fire, explosions), meet interesting characters, manage your refueling fleet, and stock goods for sale. Maybe do a couple illicit deals on the side for some extra cash.\n\nWhile you're doing that, you're also building up your government-approved surveillance operation. Start with a small room in the back filled with computers and camera feeds, and expand to a sprawling underground operation. Upgrade your tech from basic camera monitoring, to audio/visual devices that are discreetly placed onto customers' vehicles by staff, to micro devices that the pump handles automatically install. Get compensation from the government that is proportional to the value of the target: passenger cars are low-yield, whereas corporate big rigs and cars of known terrorist affiliates net you big money. (But watch out, those drivers are easier to spook.)\n\nAs you upgrade, you also would get the ability to intervene on the government's behalf. Maybe it's a high value target, and you need to fill their tank with high explosive instead of gas (make sure you've got the right target though!) Maybe your refueling trucks can also be used to spy on people in the community. Teams of assassins? Who knows, it would go as far as you'd want it to.\n\nLet me know what you think!"
a0i5gu,How to make two fire theme characters different from eachother,"I'm working on a brawler multiplayer game and I have two character ideas but they both use the element of fire. One is a female fire dancing acrobat and the other is a male firefighter covered in flames. Since I want each character and their powers to be unique, how could I make sense of them being different uses with fire?"
a0hu4p,Story path = different powers,K I've had this idea for a while and just want to see what everyone thinks about it. It's a post apocalyptic setting and people have optains powers after some world ending event.  These powers reflect the kind of character you are. For example if you make decisions that are kind and considerate of others your basic energy abilities start to gain water characteristic while on the other hand if you make rash decisions they gain fire ones. In this world there are different factions and based off the choices you make in the main story line impacts the story as a whole and your powers. So not only does different play throughts give you a new story to experience but i whole know playstyle with new powers. Was thinking of gaving ark/rust like multiplayer servers too but that was just added flair because i like multiplayer games but my real focus was on the single player.\n\nFo you think people would get excited about a game like this?

a0f0pu,Open world RPG: Where getting stronger is based on the type of souls you collected.,"So I got the idea while I was watching Soul Eater.\n\nThe world is essentially divided between the humans and demons. The games events are based on which race or races you decide to slay. The protagonist can become more or less divine and demonic dependent on the players decisions as well. Ideally, if the player opposes one race they can ally with the other and socialize i.e. shops, inns, bounties, etc in both human and demon territory.\n\nHow does that sound?"

Stats of the equipment would be hidden, the effectiveness would only be determined by the use of equipment in combat. Weapons and armor could have a limitless amount of modifiers, from target penetration to slowing rounds. As well as weight, range, power, rate of fire, price, penetration, area of effect, etc.\n\nAll players would have the same options to choose from in every ""batch"" and would receive options to purchase new equipment at the same time intervals.\n\nThe soldiers deployed would be frames for which you apply your equipment. A mounted trooper would be benefited from a weapon which can be used while moving or one that is heavy so it doesn't slow down the unit as much.\n\n"
a7kz6l,Players help build game world alongside developers,"In todays Gaming industry, there is a disparity between what developers create and what players want. More specifically, the direction a game takes after the base game is released. DLC is here to stay for the foreseeable future, good or bad, it doesn't mean there cant be a way of developing DLC that supports the core players of the game. \n\nIn order to make sure players get what they want, as well as, sustain profitability as a developer, ask a series of questions to the players that have beaten the main storyline of the game. Questions that answer how that characters storyline may progress, in future DLC. For example:\n\n**Choose wisely...**\n\n*- The hero decides to pursue a lost treasure, spoken about in legend, do you choose to go after this?*\n\n*- The warrior decides to settle down and live a life free from war to focus on his homestead. Can a warrior leave his duties and live a life of peace?*\n\n*- The wizard has heard rumors of an ancient weapon in the far west, what perils will they face? Will it spell disaster?* \n\n*- A darkness is on the horizon, what is the best way to prepare? ( Then list options for where they travel or however they prepare)*\n\n*- We must find our brother who was taken by the beasts. How will we do it?* \n\n....\n\nThese are just simple questions, probably not the best, definitely can be expanded upon with more ideas put together. This is an example of what could be. Building DLC that follow-up these questions would be main storyline arcs. A developer could throw in side DLCS unrelated to the questions for added fun. However the main point is to help build a game world where the player community builds alongside developers. Maybe this would be a step in the right direction.\n\n&amp;#x200B;"
a7k29k,Dragon Quest Role-Playing Game With Party of Demi-Monsters (Very Long!),"Elevator Pitch: A game where your four party members are part-monster. The game will try to stray away from more political topics but will have some darker material due to the fact that without it things would get stale.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nParty Members:\n\n* Main Character: The main character is part Dragon and has well-rounded stats. His main stats being defense, strength and resistance against various conditions. Was adopted by a family of farmers consisting of a mother left a widow by a dragon and the daughter. He grew very close to the daughter of the family. One day on a trip through the woods your family is attacked by monsters. You transform into a dragon temporarily and manage to defeat the, but your mother is terrified. Later that night you are given a vision stating that a monster among monsters has risen and you must slay it with the help of three companions who are also demi-monsters. You tell your mother and friend about the vision and set out to find the other heroes. In typical Dragon Quest fashion each character will have a series of skills to invest in, the main characters are as follows: Great Shields (dedicated defense but sacrifices attack power in many of it's skills. Such as a skill that maximizes defense for the next few turns but minimizes attack for the same amount. Or possibly a skill that draws the focus of all enemies. Also buffs resistances), Spears (high-single target damage with many skills that pierce through defenses and deal more damage the more buffs an enemy has), Swords (Well-rounded weapon type. Has weaker attack than Spears but provides good utility such as a chance to disarm, counter-attacks after a parry etc.) and finally Drakeblood (this skill tree gives the main character unique magic that scales off of the resistance stat in the form of elemental breath attacks and also breath attack buffs for the party that provide resistance and increased damage dealt with certain elements, a skill that taunts enemies by challenging them and also has skills that can inspire allies)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Second Party Member: This party member is part Minotaur. While he serves purposes other than that he does fill the role. Functions as a thief and lives in a town that values strength above all else. Unlike other towns that would be afraid of him, he is beloved by the town as a celebrity for frequent success in the Tournament of Arms. This is a tournament that values strength, cunning and wisdom as opposed to just physical strength. He acquired his monstrous nature from his father who drunk a magic elixir hearing it would give him the ""Strength of ten bulls."" While he did receive this strength his son was born under the effects of the elixir. Unlike most Minotaur, our second party member is rather weak physically and relies on quick thinking and planning to win the tournaments. To recruit him the main character must beat him in the tournament one-on-one. After witnessing the main character's strength he joins the party hoping to grow stronger and smarter to one day reign as the supreme champion of the world. Signature skills include debuffs such as tremors that cause knockdown, swiping loot to forge new weapons and armors and poisons to increase damage. He can assume his Minotaur form for higher damage for a limited time although it charges very slowly making him more of a burst damage character. Skill trees include Daggers (good damage and can be dual-wielded to increase damage.  Has many skills that work when surprising enemies and deal fantastic damage but only under certain conditions and with high MP Cost), Unarmed (provides good damage although not spectacular. It does however give a lot of essential thief skills such as a steal skill, disarm enemies on dodges and even a stun skill), Poison (has many skills that allow him to debuff enemies. Gives a skill that adds poisons to crafting list which can be applied to only his weapons. Also allows him to swipe components in addition to normal loot from enemies) and Taurus (which gives him a transformation which allows incredible damage by increasing his attack and dexterity for a short time. Similar to the Morph command from FFVI it recharges based on turns used without it in effect. Meaning it is useful in a pinch but must be used sparingly. Also gives stat buffs and skills for dodging and parrying along with counterattacks should he perform any of those).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Third Party Member: A dancer who works as an circus performer and bard. She is part slime and uses it to change her shape and work miracles of costume design for her shows. She will not be purely a sex appeal character like Jessica Albert in DQVIII. She will have a very developed personality to complement her good looks. She will be made to be very attractive however as it works with her themes of seduction and manipulation.  Her introductory arc will involve her Cirque being attacked by a monster that steals an heirloom of her's. The Cirque hires the two adventurers acquired thus far to retrieve the heirloom and slay the monster. The soon to be third party member will tag along to make sure the heirloom is returned properly. After retrieving the heirloom the third party member's arc will conclude with her joining the party. Her skills include wands (increase damage dealt with specific elements and also give various skills to affect magic such as a reflect skill, elemental bane skills that lower resistance to certain elements), Boomerangs (which deal pitiful damage and scale of of strength but cause a multitude of status affects such as dizzy and stun), her final skill tree is Queen Slime (which increases magic damage dealt, gives stances that raise physical defense at the cost of magical and vice-versa, and also a queen slime skill that maximises magical damage at the cost of minimizing both defense stats, magical and physical, and also the resistance stat will get a capskill called Slimegeddon which can only be used in Slime Queen form, and expends all magic to deal 1.5x the MP expended as unavoidable damage).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* The fourth and final party member is the cleric. He is a clergyman who was turned into a vampire to save his life by a visitor to his church. He leaves his church to find the vampire who turned him and also assist in the hero's quest. His initial arc revolves around the church suspecting a vampire in their midst which the party is sent to various spooky (and haunted!) crypts to root out the supposed bloodsucker. The party fights multiple undead that the church thinks to be vampires before the fourth party member tells them the truth. He leaves the church with the party not because of any hostile action with the church but just because he doesn't want to cause any trouble. Due to the predatory nature of vampires he carries a holy locket left to him by the woman who turned him which staves off his hunger.  He states that the church is just afraid of something they've never seen and without that amulet he could very well be the monster they claim him to be. He is the healer of the group and his skill trees consist of Wands ( unlike the third party member his skills prioritize healing and dispelling debuffs. He also gains a skill that can turn undead which causes them to flee and still yield experience points. He also gains skills for reviving the dead which are featured in many jokes about how he can't revive himself to cure himself of vampirism), Instruments (which provide many skills that buff the party, debuff enemies and enhance healing given), and his final skill Humanity (due to Vampirism being actually evil the nature of this skill tree is reducing status affects which disable your healer such as silence, wound and eventually Doom. One skill I plan to include is a skill that inSome other feature of this skill tree include typical vampire abilities such as sleep, confusion along with a transformation that increases the power of debuffs and also your dodge chance for a short time.\n\nGame Mechanics: Much of the gameplay inspirations for this game come from a PS2 title called Wild Arms 3. A forgettable, poorly crafted JRPG with an outstanding combat system. Most notable here is the way the game handles your party speed. The game gives you many a meta strategy to outwit your enemy and specifically plays against certain strategies.  I wanted to capture something similar here with your party speed.  Since your mage actually works somewhat different from typical mages and takes more magic damage than physical and changing stance to adapt to what the enemy is using, many dungeons designed to be difficult will take advantage of things like this by using your party speed. Such as a damaging mage enemy being made to move between your mage character and your main character who move last in the turn order (who move first in the party order).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother interesting party mechanic are the transformations. Your main character can burn his MP like a battery to transform into his Dragonborn form. This gives tremendous buffs to his physical defense, magical defense, general resistances, and strength stats. These transformations are powerful to say the least. I plan to balance this by making the SP and Healing items finite meaning you can't just buy ethers and potions to cheat through a boss fight. That was another interesting mechanic in Wild Arms 3 that made the difficulty much more interesting until the later game where nearly nothing could kill you. Many enemies will actually be designed to counter these transformations in a way. Your priest becomes very weak to light damage in his awakened form. As such many enemies with light type spells will go specifically for him if he pops this willy nilly. What I was thinking of was having these transformations be more like the Pepped Up/In The Zone from Dragon Quest XI or Trance from Final Fantasy IX. They activate after being damaged enough times and afford combinations skills based on the users of these skills. Which brings me on to my next topic\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTeam Skills: These have always been a favorite of mine. From the fusion skills of Persona and Pep/Zone Skills from Dragon Quest XI. Being the rarities they are many of them bring a unique spice to combat which would usually be just repeating the usual skills until the enemy ""faints"" as is the case in Pokemon. I'd like them to be diverse and possibly situational. Obviously a skill that deals fire damage would be much weaker on a fire dragon and this metagame of knowledge and enemy types would work wonders for forcing players to switch up their strategies. In my opinion you should always throw a wrench in the party's strategies so they are forced to come up with new ones and adapt.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStats: Of course none of this would make sense without a general stat spread for the party members. A ""0"" in a stat is average where a higher number is excellent. Negative numbers represent poor skills such as the Mage's magical resistance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n||HP|Strength|Physical Defense|Magical Defense|Resistance|Magic|Speed|Luck|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Dragon|2|1.5|2|2|1|0|0|\-2|\n|Minotaur|0|0|\-1.5|\-1.5|\-1|0|2|1.5|\n|Slime|\-1|\-2|\-1|\-2|\-1|3|1|3|\n|Vampire|0|0|\-1|\-1|1|3|3|\-2|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet me know what I could do to make this idea better!"
a7jewp,ADD WHAT EVER YOU WANT TO MY BR GAME,"Hello, I'm gonna start working on a realistic BR game later this year and have many ideas and thought it would be nice to have what the customer want in the game IN THE GAME. So the game development will hopefully be manly open. Comment what you would like to see in the game or you might find me in the Bearded\_Baiter twitch chat talking about ideas."
a7ia5n,“Venari” - Hunters vs hunted PVP,"Short introduction:\nSo I’ve been working on this game idea for quite some time now. I thought that instead of just throwing out some random ideas spontaneously, I have been brainstorming, analyzing and thought in depth about this game idea.\nSomewhat wanted to keep this for myself in hopes of developing it some day, but I think it would be healthy to get some opinions. Enjoy!\n\nCore concept:\nThe whole game is based on the hunter vs the hunted theme that is brought to a competitive video game. A match would include 2 teams of 4-6 members, one team as the survivors/hunted who must complete a certain amount of objectives within a certain area, within a certain time, and a team as the hunter force with the task of finding, hunting and eliminating the opponent before survivors succeed their objectives. A match would span between 30-40 minutes, where the teams would swap halfway.\nThe game is a first or third person arena strategy kind of game. \n\nTheme:\nHaven’t thought this entirely through yet, because I’m not sure if the game is best suited for a fantasy theme (with magic and powers) or a medieval setup. I have worked with the idea of the game being set in a modern age but turned down the idea, because of modern war fare primarily being ranged. And I wanted melee aspects and close combats involved.\n\nI imagined the setup being some kind of a pre-war battlefield. The survivors are a group of scouts and soldiers with the task of preparing an area for battle. With the tasks of clearing camps, setting up camps etc. (will come back to this under objectives). And the hunter team being the defending side in the battle scanning and hunting down their territory for potential enemy’s. \nThis is maybe the part I need help from you guys. Finding the ideal setup and theme/story for the game.\n\nMechanics:\nSo supporting the main concept of hunters vs survivors, I want to focus on the hunting and fleeing elements.\nHunters has to first of all find out where their target. This they have to do by strategically scanning the map for enemy’s by working together. When enemy is found, decisions has to be made based on enemy type/strength/number, distance, awareness etc. Then the hunters must execute the hunt led by an attack.\nSurvivors must think the other way around. How to reach the objectives fast, without getting caught and in a condition to defend. Risks must be taken. Playing safe may not get your team many objectives, playing risky may get you caught.\nA thing players must be aware of while navigating the battlefield is the senses we have as a human. Sight, smell and hearing plays a major part in how to find or avoid enemies. Hunters use these senses to find the target and in some cases use stealth to come closer to the target without alert.\nSurvivors use these senses to alert teammates and avoid enemies.\nThis way players have to think strategically when moving around, as their actions may have an impact.\n\nMap mechanics:\nThe map where the teams will be playing is big enough for hunters being forced to go search for the enemy’s to find them, but small enough for them to be able to find them every game. The battlefield could be a variety of natural landscapes. For example wide fields, tight forest, mountain and hills, rivers to pass and lakes to go around, beach, etc.\nLocations could vary from map to map, but with each map having variety within them.\nWeather conditions would also vary, having fog, rain, snow, clear skies, wind etc.\nThese conditions plays a part in what decisions to make when you plan your strategy. Snow might leave behind tracks, the wind direction makes sounds and smells travel further, rain makes noise, fog makes it hard to see and so on.  Routes players take will thereby have influence on the success of going from A to B without getting spotted. For example would crossing a river loose the trace, crawling in high grass makes you harder to see and so on, but of the cost of speed.\n\nCombat mechanics:\nIn general the combat is based on medieval methods (swords, axes, archery, throwing knives, war beasts, etc). \nThe way players take damage has initial damage and bleeding damage. Depending on the attack type and character, the attacks will vary with the amount of initial and bleeding damage it does.\nBleeding damage will have an effect on your character. The character will be slower, leave a trace of blood and tend to be more noisy because of the pain caused. These things will make the damaged character easier found/heard/caught. The character can stop his/hers bleeding by stopping up and taking care of the injury.\n\nCharacters:\nThe characters you play will be different and specialized. All characters are balanced around a base stat with speed, health, damage, noise production and hear/smell distance.\nCharacters will all have a unique set of skills and wielded either with a ranged or a melee weapon. All chars can run, crouch, prone and sprint. The sprint is based on a stamina system helping balancing the characters (some may sprint faster in short distances and some may sprint slower but for longer distances). Stamina will also be the resource of your combat moves, used as a balancing parameter for the different chars.\nSome chars I have been working on:\n\nHunters:\n\n- Beast master\nHas a hound and a hawk. He can send out his hawk which will scan the area for enemies and make a cry if any found.\nHound will bark when found or heard something of interest. Can be unleashed to lead the attack or to track the enemy.\nThis char would be rather slow as he has benefit of his beasts. He is very effective of finding the enemy but may lack power in combat scenarios. \n\n- Scout\nFast but fragile and produces very little noise when moving around. Can set traps and uses archery for bleeding damage that makes targets easier traced and height initial damage blows with up close dagger sneak attacks. \nThis char would be used to send out when enemies are found and to help the team catch them.\n\nSurvivors:\n\n- Brute\nHas a lot of health and damage, but slow and noisy. Specialized in combat and protection. Has big shield and completes objectives faster.\nThis is the tank kind of char that would best at objectives and in combat, but is easily caught and slow when moving around the map.\n\n- The monk\nVery good in melee combat with high initial damage. Blind (instead of seeing like the other chars, the monk will have a kind of fog of war view distance) but exceptional good hearing making the monk gave extended hearing range. \nThis char would be a support kind of role. Having the monk in fog or woods would be beneficial because of his hearing range.\n\nI have a few more ideas for characters, but this will do for now.\n\nObjectives:\nThe survivors shouldn’t just walk around surviving in a pvp game with limited time. So I decided to give them objectives to force the survivor team to not just camp and hide.\nObjectives would be pre war relevant tasks. For example setting up a camp, clearing an area for wildlife (wolves/bears), build bridges over rivers etc.\nThe objectives would be spread out on the map varying in types and difficulty (this should be based on a system balancing the reward of going for certain objectives). \nHow the objectives are made has to be tested and balanced to make the game function. Objectives could be seen or heard from a greater distance when activated, interrupted by the hunters, and rewarded differently based in risks taken to make it.\n\nTeamwork:\nIt is important for me that teamwork plays a major role in the game. The different characters should benefit one another, helping teammates take care of their injury is faster, and the different roles of detecting/avoiding and combat. You should be punished by being alone weather it’s being vulnerable, or slow. For example would the brute be slow to make it for a objective by himself, and the faster ones would be vulnerable if attacked. And the hunters would have a hard time finding the enemies without a scanning string character. \n\nThe balancing in the game is very important. If you’re too reliant on teamwork and you’re down 3 teammates. Then players would tend to give up. It’s necessary with a comeback system where you still have a chance of winning but against the odds if you are behind.\n\nQuestion/thoughts:\nSo that’s what I got for you. Hope you find it interesting and worth the read. I’ll answer any questions and you’re thoughts are highly appreciated."
a7g26q,Meme Card Game,"In this hypothetical game, everyone makes their own cards. The cards don't have any stats, instead, they're memes. The goal is to have the funniest cards. There could be something to make sure that there are no identical cards so people don't just use the same few. For now I'll say that a deck has ten cards in it.\n\nThe game is multiplayer, with either three or five players. We'll assume three for right now. The game plays as follows:\n\n1. Lobby formed. Players have a few seconds to look at the other's decks, to gauge the other's sense of humor.\n2. Player 1 and Player 2 each put down a card. Those cards are discarded for the rest of the match.\n3. Player 3 votes on which card was funnier. If Player 1's card was funnier- 1 point for Player 1. Same for Player 2.\n4. Player 1 and Player 3 play, Player 2 votes.\n5. Player 2 and Player 3 play, Player 1 votes.\n6. Repeat until everyone is out of cards. Whoever has the most points wins the match.\n\nThe strategy part of the game comes from trying to gauge the other player's senses of humor to score the most points.\n\nOther details:\n\n""Edginess"" classifications might be a good idea. For example, Clean, 13+, 18+, and Too Edgy. \n\nThere could be a card-trading system. Players pay each other in-game gold for their cards. Since no one card is identical, the good cards would have value.\n\nA ranked ladder would help put people with others in their skill level.\n\n&amp;#x200B;"

a7erqf,Cities in Arms - A competitive civilization sim where a computer manages resources while the player plays from the first person perspective.,"A competitive civilization sim where a computer manages resources while the player plays from the first person perspective. Other npcs would manage the work between all the structures, which would act like drones from a birds eye view, but will also have procedurally generated dialogue and personality types. Quests would also be procedurally generated depending on the npc and their specific needs/occupation. And you could work up through a combination of quests and overall fame within an occupation in order to gain control over specific structures already in use by the simulated community, and get involved in city planning, resource acquisition, warfare, etc., in order to ensure the survival of your sim city over a competing simulated city. This is a game where the player has exactly the same stats as any standard npc, and they pretty much just treat you like one of them. You don't level, you can't get stronger, smarter, or faster. Instead you must rely on the infrastructure of a simulated community, and work with groups of npcs each with specialized tasks and that are able to follow commands in order to build something greater than the sum of its individuals. This game could also be a multiplayer game. And since each side would have dozens or hundreds of npcs, you could feasibly play 1vComputer, 1v1, 5vComputer, 5v5, or 50v50."

a7b052,"God of Gamblers, card cheat tournament","The title and story for this idea comes from a series of Hong Kong gambling films starring Chow Yun Fat, and *All for the Winner* with Stephen Chow (check Wikipedia for a list of *God of Gamblers* related movies--there were a bunch of them), but it could just as easily reference US card cheat movies or not reference any movies at all.  The developer would have to do extensive research on card cheating techniques.\n\nIn the universe of Hong Kong gambling movies, cheating is just being really good at gambling.  That's the basic premise of the God of Gamblers title; it's the world's best gambler, and it's always someone who cheats (or has special powers).  This game has the player starting out as a gambler who dreams of winning the God of Gamblers tournament in Macau.  In the ""career mode"" story/campaign you select from different gambling rooms and casinos where you play cards against players of different skill levels who use different techniques, learning new moves (which also helps you to catch opponents using those moves) and building your reputation/winnings so you can enter the tournament.\n\nGameplay would first and foremost be realistic/fair Texas Hold 'Em with competent AI, only players can also cheat.  On top of that, two mechanics:  1) You use a controller or keyboard and mouse to shuffle, deal, etc.  This shouldn't be as extreme as QWOP, but imagine something like Tony Hawk's Pro Skater for cards.  As the game progresses, you learn special moves like stacking the deck, dealing from the bottom of the deck, etc.  You perform these moves much the same as you'd pull off special moves in a skateboarding game.  2) Detecting ""tells"" and cheating would play like interrogation in L.A. Noire; there would be visual clues, and learning new techniques would reveal more information.  Also, talking to NPCs before/during the game could reveal information about tells or cheating techniques.\n\nIf you catch another player cheating, you can accuse them and end that game.  You normally wouldn't want to do that outside the tournament, though, because ending the game means you can't win more money off them; better to know how they're cheating and use it against them.  Up until the tournament, the player's main concern would be not getting caught themselves.  In the tournament, accusing a player and not being able to prove it gets you disqualified (though in some cases you might ""bluff"" an opponent and get them to admit they're cheating).  Some players might pretend to cheat, hoping to trick their opponent into falsely accusing them.\n\nIn the beginning, you don't know anything about cheating, but you soon learn your first technique and build up a number of skills, plus you can purchase or craft cheating devices.  Skills and devices are obtained from interacting with NPCs or from beating a cheater and forcing him/her to teach you; each time you earn a skill or device, you get a practice/tutorial session.  Part of the campaign (for both challenge and replay value) is you have limited time before the tournament, so you can't visit every gambling room and casino, so you can't learn every technique.\n\nMultiplayer games and tournaments would start with the players choosing a limited number of techniques they've unlocked through the single player campaign."

a75bo6,Deal-making game,"Hello, \n\ntogether with u/pan_rac we're designing a deal-making game called 'Vital Deal'. It will be set in science-fiction universe populated by ludings - joyful but short-lived creatures. You take on a role of enterprising luding that travels to various planets meeting folks and doing business. While it may sound like one, Vital Deal is not meant to be a classic  trading/merchandising  game. Of course you buy and sell stuff, but Vital  Deal is not about seizing a business opportunity – it’s about creating  it.  See the gameplay loop example and let us know your thoughts on the direction we're heading with this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n *You arrive as a newcomer to the city of Zubar, with only a handful of  contacts, some loose cash and cargo of guns hidden in stash in the  desert. First thing you decide is building up your prestige – you buy  some fancy suit, reflective shades and put a new paint on your dronecar.  Then you visit some local bonzos and try to spend some time with them,  rubbing shoulders, earning some trust. Finally you get the message that  one of your fresh contacts – a local ganglord Zed Zando is willing to  buy some firepower (X guns, to be exact). You call him and schedule the  meeting. You don’t know each other well, so you assume he doesn’t trust  you much – thats why a timeslot proposed for the meeting is dangerously  thin. The meeting will take place in smugglers den in commoner district.  Arriving there takes you some time and it seems that you need a  positive opinion of gang-thugs to let you in. You need to hang out a bit  with them, to earn some trust, but it takes you some time and makes the  ganglord awaiting you a bit angry (slight patience penalty for being  late on meeting). Luckilly, your pumped-up prestige and resulting trust,  makes a patience loss less painful. You know the contract conditions  and bid your price. It seems you missed a price tolerance of ganglord,  which results in further patience loss – his face is starting to look  almost enraged. You decide to play it rough. You burn some of your  esteem and press the negotiations – ganglord patience is locked for this  round and his price tolerance is expanded, but along with your esteem  you burn ganglords trust. You’re determined to take the risk and rebuild  the trust by professionaly completing this contract. You alter the  conditions of contract scheduling really quick delivery, and while the  ganglord doesn’t trust you much there is not much freedom in altering  the place of delivery. You only have about 10 real-life minutes to  deliver the cargo to abandoned LC military base. You rent a cargo  dronecar with some porters, leave your personal dronecar on the lot, and  rush to your hidden stash in the desert. You load the cargo with help  of porters and fly over the desert to the abandoned base. You make it  just on time, and after unloading you receive a fat money transfer,  prestige boost and significant bonus to ganglords trust toward you.* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you like that idea and want to know more in terms of game rules, see our reddit entry on deal-making mechanics in r/gamedesign [https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedesign/comments/a751gm/design\_of\_dealmaking\_mechanics/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedesign/comments/a751gm/design_of_dealmaking_mechanics/)\n\nWe also invite you to follow us on twitter [@A14Games](https://twitter.com/a14games) for updates on Vital Deal game development progress."

a723c4,River City Ransom Underground meets Dungeon Boss,"OK idea is similar to the other mobile games out there in the world. You get X amount of energy you can use per hour and replenish over time and the whole nine yards. The main idea of the game is that you are in a gang that owns its own turf that you are defending. You recruit various characters through different means (campaign, unlocking chests, quests etc). You then assign characters to ""defend"" your turf so when another player raids you it will use those characters. The defenders are controlled via AI or if you are currently on the game you can join and actually defend in real time. Other features:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1.) Campaign mode will be similar to levels in RCR where its a 2.5 side scroller type thing where you go start to finish. You can replay levels to obtain experience etc and unlock characters.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2.) Characters can be upgraded by various means. You can ""train"" them in certain aspects like punching, kicking, elbows, knees, slams. You can also train defense on all of those and some heroes have a natural boost in some areas. You can unlock various moves to use during battle that focus on on of the 5 attacks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3.) If the game becomes popular have sanctioned events where there are ""cards"" like the UFC in which people can watch in real time. Have lower level bouts and even big bouts for the best players. If the player doesnt log in real time they would be controlled by AI.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n4.) Have raids or gang fights which more than 1 person is on the screen at a time which encourages guild play.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI will never build this game but seems like it would be fun. The considerations is that this would be desirable in a mobile setting but maybe not on the desktop. This would cause some game play issues because it would be tough to have a ""virtual joystick"" that could allow you to effectively control the character well (or maybe not?). The main screen would be completely UI based. You would click on various UI components to perform actions that you want to do."
a71vms,A game based in a fictional operating system. Story Ideas Needed.,My idea is a game that takes place within a computer's operating system. I plan on making a game like this and have done some preliminary research to see if there is anything like it already available. I have come across a game called [Sara is Missing](https://kotaku.com/a-horror-game-about-finding-a-strangers-phone-1789275686) which appears to be similar except for the fact it takes place on a phone.  My idea is slightly different in that it will be more like a text based adventure game in which instead of exploring a world by giving instructions such as 'go west' the player will enter commands into a fictional operating system and explore the operating system. I would really like to play this and intend on making it however I am struggling to come up with an interesting story that could be told in a game like this.

a70gu3,"My big Exploration game idea, What do you think?","So I have been trying to think through some ideas on this big mmo type game. I have a few hang ups that I hope some people could help iron out. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo the game's working title is Tribes. In Tribes it is a survival sim but massive multiplayer variant, that is all about discovery. When you start the game you get to choose a tribe to join, let's say 1 of 100 different tribes. Each tribe has it's own God, that has created them, so when you create a character, your tribes god molds you from the clay and sends you into the world. The world that is dark save for what your tribe has managed to explore and uncover. So as you line of sight uncovers the world you are mapping it for your tribe. Say you uncover the Grand Canyon! such a significant landmark deserves a name so you as the explorer get to write the name for the canyon, and you call it 'Canyon McCanyonface' but this doesn't take effect unless you can update your map with the rest of the tribe. So you head back to Tribe's HQ and update the Tribe's map. This way you can compete with other tribe members on who gets to name the world. Because even if you found the canyon, if your buddy beat you back to base he gets the credit for the find. This also works for Tribe vs Tribe combat, remember there are 99 other tribes in the world, so if you find a tribe unknown to your tribe best got back to HQ and update the Tribe's map, before that other Tribe murders you to keep their location secret. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEach tribe starts in the stone age, and the tribe as a whole needs to invest in new technologies and advance, so each new crafting achievement needs to be shared with the tribe as a whole and elevates your people over the other tribes of the world. So say you send a lot of time with the wild horses of the world and manage to train them, then train them as a team and get chariot technology, you need to share that tech with the rest of your tribe so you and your tribe members can turn the tide with the war with tribe 76. \n\nI should touch on the main drive of the game, it is of world dominance. If you kill a Tribe God statue/HQ you have killed the tribe and that Tribe's members respawn as your tribe members. So eventually of the 100 tribes the game will eventually be an epic war of 2 tribes and the game will eventually end. Then servers will restart or Tribes 2 will be released, who knows? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut a dead tribe all their tech, discovered map, and members get absorbed into the victorious tribe. Any tribes men that are still alive after their Tribe's god has been destroyed become bandits, they have one life should they die they respawn into the new tribe. Should the bandit band somehow manage to destroy another tribes god then they could reinstate their own tribe. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nall the tribes are different, I don't want internet guides to pop up the whole point of this game is new discovery and exploration so I want all the tribes to have their own tech trees and their own abilities. That way there can't be a internet guide each tribe has to dedicate it's own efforts into advancing itself. I want this so badly that each tribe is gonna have it's own language. To you the player each building and signage will be in english, (or your language of choice) but to any other tribe the words will be gibberish. If you talk to a fellow tribe member then it will be in english, but if you talk to another tribe the voice will be garbled and distorted. Unless there is an alliance between your tribes, and you have traded languages. \n\nI want to add in fantasy elements, like a magic system for more tech that can be unlocked for tribes, just for more interesting match ups, say tribe 45 devoted a lot to the magic system and their members can cast fire balls where as Tribe 58 devoted more time to tech and have muskets. Then you have a tribe war with guns and magic that I think would be fun. \n\nBesides personal magic I want divine magic to be a prevalent force in the world. I also want death to hold value, so for example, say the standard game if you die there is an hour cool down before you can respawn (add fluff, your god taking your soul and blowing it into a new body). But if you make the right sacrifice to your god, you can cut the respawn rate in half. This would also relate to the tribes being different and making it hard for internet guides. So Tribe 1 sacrifices a horse to speed up respawn but sacrificing a horse to the god of tribe 3 does nothing or something else to improve respawn tribe 3 has to sacrifice oxen. idk some kind of system like that. Besides respawn rate divine magic should be other tribe related things, all tribe movement is increased, attack power increased, resource gathering increased. etc.\n\nWhere as personal magic is cast fire ball, magical armor, necromancy, other typical wizardy things. \n\nI also want events, like legendary beasts but like 1 in all the world. The effort is to try to create urban myth within the game. So a scout trying to map a forest discovers a giant! so he retreats and tells all his tribe members don't go into the forest up north because there is an all powerful giant that lives up there. \n\nAnd like the 1 off legendary monsters, I want ruins of past civilizations to be in the map to be looted, some might hold tech that can be gathered for the whole tribe but others could hold only a single use item, a legendary weapon. That way the explorer is rewarded for their own ventures, This too can create it's own myths. Tribe 1 finds the lady of the lake and earns excaliber but the player who welded the blade dies in the war and now Tribe 32 holds the mythic blade. That type of myth and cool game story telling. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo that is the game in a nutshell, it is the strategy game civilization, but you arn't the all powerful being controlling the civilization you are the pawn first person view and at the same time sharing the big picture responsibility with your other players. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI really liked No Man Sky's method of discovery that you can name the planets and the animals and everything, it gave me a Lewis and Clark feeling but it was short lived because it didn't matter there are too many planets and no one is ever going to see my named planet and my named animals. My game it would matter because you are naming for your entire tribe, and if your tribe conquered another your naming influence would only grow. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am just stuck on resource management and tribe government. How does Tribe 1 decide to have a alliance with tribe 2? How do the tribes negotiate trade deals? How does the tribe pool resources together? Then how does the tribe decide to spend the pooled resources on iron work, or destruction magic? \n\n&amp;#x200B;"
a6xv8n,"Dreamt of playing this game, I want it to be real so much it hurts.","I had a dream of playing this game last night and I cannot get it out of my head. You start out as an evil all powerful overlord who decides to leave the life of darkness and become good. Now, the mechanics of a normal game where you get stronger as you progress was flipped. You start out all powerful and crushing enemies with big strong attacks, but as your character draws their power from evil and darkness, the further they stray from evil the weaker the hero gets. \n\nI basically started out crushing enemies easily but, over time, I'd lose height, strength, and armor. Slowly becoming a normal man and having to use quick, evasive, clever tactics to take down these giant beasts I once rivaled. \n\nIn the end you start to draw power from light and and morality and use it to take down evil for good.\n\nThere wasn't much storyline other than that but in the dream the game mechanics were so much fun, starting out as a huge powerful behemoth, then having to adapt and switch up your play style as you progressed. I woke up like, I need to play some more, only to realize it was a dream 😫\nI know it may seem vague or silly, but it was a dream so don't be too harsh 🤷"
a6x22w,Need Mini-Game Idea,"The requirements are you have a bunch of NPCs and the player working on a job/task. The job can be something like blacksmithing in a workshop to make items, or working at a bar, or managing a store(like Recettear), or training in a boot camp.\n\nThe Player does not directly control NPCs but he can manipulate them, and the game is all about how the player and NPCs interact with each other, build relationship between themselves and achieve the goal of the job over a week's time(7 days) or maybe a month(30 days).\n\nWhat do you think is a Mini-Game(something arcadey? puzzle?) that can work with this?\n\n"
a6wajo,A first person horror game where the primary tool the player has to defend themselves is a hand mirror (and other assorted vision tools),"Everyone knows the most stressful part of a horror game is  ~~moving, talking, feeling emotion, having eyes, ears, heart, or a soul~~ turning around. But what if instead the game flipped the script, and the primary tool you have throughout the gameplay is a hand mirror? \n\nHere's the rules for all you out there in the audience: \n\n1) I don't mean/ don't want any Medusa-esk mythos or game design. I don't mean this idea as a ""the monster that's chasing us's greatest weapon is eye-gaze based and we use that against it"" I'm just presenting the idea of a hand mirror as a tooling for the player to survive and thrive- but if you derive anything from this than IDC. \n\n2) The focus of the game (eg its namesake, lore, monster mythos, etc) isn't central to object. Totally divorce this gameplay mechanic from the lore of the game; aka if these tools were applied to any generic ""walk thru a confined area with a monster, escape"" horror game (SOMA, Layers of Fear, Slenderman, Outlast*, Visage,) how could these tools be used?\n\nBasic uses that first come to mind: looking behind you- seeing over your shoulder; if the monster dude is behind you but wants you to turn around/ they're attention is only grabbed when you look at them then it could be a lifesaver. Advanced uses: looking around corners, looking under doors, looking to see what's real and what isn't if your game's brand of an insanity meter gets too high. \n\nThe point of these is, there can be fun inventive interactions in a game that are ""this may only work once but to hell with it"" that strive to give the player a sense of satisfaction and inventiveness for finding new uses for tools. Heck I'd probably include some kind of way to throw the hand mirror as an auditory distraction tool; yeah you may only get *one* but how much would you gamble in order to survive that *one more moment* and get a second wind at running away? Yes it's wasteful technically but whatever it takes. \n\n___\n\nExample of a Game Idea: **Midnight Manor**\n\nYou and a camera crew decide to investigate a haunted house known for the ghost of its mysterious matron haunting the halls at, you guessed it, midnight. Clock strikes, ghost binch comes out, spooks yall, *kablam* throws you and your camera team for a loop by murdering some of yall, knocking yall out in some individual jump scares for good measure, making this an infinite hallway puzzle and you're now trapped in the ghostly manor of this ghost's mind-palace. \n\nOur main character wakes up in her bedroom. Starts looking for key items, finds a key, maybe an old flashlight *but it needs batteries!* We've all seen this puzzle formula of horror game. *But!* the player picks up the hand mirror. Maybe they drop it, maybe they put it in their pocket for inventory, they can inspect it, thinking it'll show up later; boom first jumpscare, you died, restart. But!! If they equip the hand mirror- it is actually reflective-! It lets them see... behind them! Huge breakthroughs are had. \n\nOther ideas: you pick up the film camera your crew was using to record- we can do here in-game as we can with real life, where other games\* may not, you could use it to poke around corners, look up as high as you can stand on your tippytoes, or down into places where you can't go like reaching it into a pipe where you can't fit with so learn how to solve the puzzle of that room from the other side. You could take pictures of ghosts to heal your insanity or record audio-video of one ghost-mother scolding her ghost-son to ward off the immediate spirits chasing you at the sight of its one mortal fear(?) This isn't like some prompted, scripted event to get that recording however- if you just so happen to take a recording of the mother- and don't delete the file- and just so happen to play it again- it might just give you enough skin in the game to save your life. \n\n___\n\n\*I mention Outlast in this list because while it was hailed as new and innovative when it came out (at least to my perception) I don't really feel as if it really did very much innovation within the genre. The ""camera"" useage was effectively *just* a flashlight. The idea of having a ~~oil lamp~~ flashlight constantly draining battery life wasn't that new and while I commend it on its atmosphere it didn't really do very much in way of inventiveness. "
a6uz2z,Borderlines: CoD Black Ops style American Civil War game,"After playing Call of Duty Black Ops, I've really been interested in games with clandestine operations that ""didn't happen"" because were so secretive that they've been lost to history. \n\nMy idea is a primarily single player game that is in the same vain as Black Ops but set in the American Civil War. While it would technically be alternate history, it would be thoroughly researched in such a way that it feels grounded in reality and that it could have actually happened. \n\nThe game will center around the Union's Allan Pinkerton's Secret Service, the precursor to the United States Secret Service. The game would follow Pinkerton's elite soldiers on their clandestine missions against the Confederacy. \n\nThe rough outline of the campaign is as follows: The game starts off at the Battle of Antietam, the bloodiest battle of the war. This mission would very much be like the typical civil war battles you see on TV, with soldiers lining up and shooting at each other across wide open fields. Your character, a Union Army officer, leads your troops to victory, successfully stopping the Confederate offensive. After the battle, you are approached by Allan Pinkerton, who tells you he is impressed by your combat record. He is assembling an elite group of soldiers to defeat the Confederacy and that he wants you to join. You agree to join, and your career as a special forces soldier begins.\n\nSome missions would include taking back a Union telegraph outpost, ziplining onto General Lee's train to assassinate him in the Shenandoah mountains, stealthfully avoiding Lee's army in the Shenandoah valley, bombarding shore positions with an ironclad on the Louisiana bayou, sinking enemy ships in the USS Aligator, engaging in a tank battle with armored steam plows, assaulting a Mexican fort by parachuting in from balloons, and much more."
a6uikq,Scooby-Doo Detective RPG.,"Sizeable open world. Character-based RPG and dialogue trees with important decision making. There would be loads of minor side-missions that act as the episodic version, while the main quest would be more akin to an entire movie of content. It would be set in the Scooby-Doo universe and could explore more of the sinister elements of the fiction (see: Scooby-Doo: On Zombie Island). It would have Witcher/Batman style detective work while also having a much heavier focus on puzzles as opposed to direct combat (LA Noire?).\n\nI grew up watching some of the older Scooby-Doo series and it is still to this day my favorite animation. I'm surprised nobody else has brought something like this up."
a6ubcx,An Open World Zombie/Division/Wildlands Hybrid,"I’m thinking a game that’s Post Apocalypse Zombie infested, tied in with the division for hunting materials to make weapons and armour with 3rd person view, with wildlands ontop to train your character in tracking and spotting and tactical warfare to kill zombies efficiently then maybe add a Build a base aspect the more you play and savage you build a stronger fortification to prevent infected getting in, could also use the RDD 2 thing where you interact with people to see if they’d join you or fight? \n\nI know zombie games are all the rage now but they all seem the same "
a6r4lp,Cyborg who augments his himself,"You'd be playing as a cyborg in a distant dystopian future. At the beginning you would be a partially destroyed cybernetic skeleton, and as you progress through the game you work to repair your skeleton, upgrade your power core, and get to a point where you can add on and augment your body with unique abilities and weapons. I imagine different systems you could build like stealth, close quarters or ranged combat.  I don't have a story idea yet but that would be the mechanic that the game revolves around. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm thinking about building the game in a 2d engine such as construct 2 or gamemaker studio, and eventually recreating it as a 3d game in unreal as a get more comfortable with game design.\n\nCould i get some feedback on the idea and different engines for 2d game building? Thanks."
a6q16b,An online city where you can do whatever you want with other people,"I have always wanted to explore the cities in the backgrounds of games. I am imagining a city that is the whole game world that could possibly lead to dungeons depending on how you wanted to play. There would be an arena where your weapons, armour, style are from other games, the developers own designs and player designs. You could be a blacksmith, shopkeep, adventurer, racer or anything you want. The inspiration for this is like the oasis in the fact that you can do anything you want but with of course limitations and sword art online as it is a more limited world but where you can do pretty much everything"

Throw him the correct weapons and potions to deal with the enemies and obstacles he encounters. i.e. a shield when he's running towards arches, a warhammer when he's charging an enemy with a shield, or a spear for cavalry.\n\nThis would work pretty well for IOS as well, controls are minimal and most of the screen could be dedicated to the action."

Needless to say, i love ducktales, but i still prefer the comics . \n\nanyway i know about the ducktales video game, but it doesnt do justice to the whole Mc Duck universe. \n\nid like a proper high res, 4K , 3d gameplay  modern game with scrooge and his money bin with all the rooms, the roof, his office, everything. lots of potential with the beagle boys and magica de spell , plattformer ideas, with shooter elements. \n\nPlus, i ve seen ""official"" blueprints of the money bin, in a story, made by the  artist who wrote the story . \n\nyet i havent seen anybody  use these blueprints. (except from an  awesome lego build i saw on youtube )  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ni dont even need a game. i just want a 3d represantation of the money , \n\nRemember the Titanic honor and glory demo ? \n\nsth like that"
a6nxde,A fully customisable football (soccer) game with infinite leagues!,"I was playing Pro Evo the other day, and wile I like it, it's customisation is INCREDIBLY limiting...\n\nYou can only edit teams in the pre defined leagues, and thus my local low league team plays cup games at the camp nou and all the supporters flags are in Chinese... :/\n\nSo here is my idea, focus on building a great soccer game, but don't waste money on securing any real team licences. Just add as many leagues from as many countries as possible, I'm talking hundreds. All with placeholder names and logos. Much like Football Manager. Then players can go in and edit the teams they want (or download a save file). If their league does not exist then the can just make a new one.\n\nTeams and stadiums range from the bottom division part timers having a kick about in a field watched by one man and his dog, right up to big palaces worthy of a World Cup final. \n\nI'm talking hyper customisation, everything from importing 3D stadium models, to changing the add board and stadium music. \n\nThe other big feature would be the season mode. Unlike FIFA or PES when you set up a league and you only play games from that tournament (not cup ties or European games etc) you can set up a full league structure with teams getting relegated and promoted. But your not a manager (unless you want to) you just get to play a great game of football. \n\nThat's my idea. Don't know how successful it would be, but I would buy the hell out of it!\n"
a6iwgb,White Pants,A racing game where you unlock white pants for you driver which you never see. 
a6gros,Versus Roguelite between Heaven and Hell Realms,"The main mechanic comes from Terraria's ""creeping"" landscapes/tile sets.  Evil terrain spreads, but so does good terrain.  Killing all enemies in an area renders it neutral, and you could colonize or terraform it (i.e., bring AI followers or build structures) or just allow your terrain type to spread to it.  The player can choose which side to begin on and makes his/her way through neutral territory, all the way to the enemy base/boss.\n\nNeutral areas would contain enemies that attack any player, whereas evil/good area enemies would contain more difficult enemies that only attack the opposing player.\n\nRushing would be a valid strategy, but building up and expanding your territory would increase defense and give you AI followers that join you in battle (nothing super-complicated, they just spawn in your territory and can be ordered to follow you into adjoining areas).  I'm seeing something like a cross between King Arthur's Gold and Kingdom: New Lands, only areas/battlefields are stacked on top of one another.  It would play sort of like a platformer roguelite crossed with a 2D side-scrolling RTS."
a6ggo4,Meta-Fighting Game: Play as a pro-gamer,"The premise is that you play as a professional fighting game player competing in tournaments, playing out a real fighting game with more focus on RPG-elements and things play out via turns instead of real-time.    \n\nEach in-game tournament-fighter has their own unique skilltrees that mostly enhance their specific focus (like a heavily defensive fighter acquiring additional HP and the ability to ignore a failed block in a blockstring once per switch, as well as giving a buff to damage for combos coming off a reversal, a weak character with a great Assist might not get many options to develop their on-screen stats but their Assist might turn out God-Tier) and make them unique for this style of play even in ways that would be unwieldy, weak or overpowered in a more real-time game.\n\nBut the primary focus is the Pro-Player, improving their chances of blocking, giving additional options for consistent pressure that must be predicted by the opponent or spending hours developing 'Their' combo to give it more damage than it should receive.\n\nThere would be 3 common resources to use in the game:\n\n1: Health, the obvious stuff. Get all 3 tournament characters to 0HP and you win. Red Health is a thing too, some of the damage isn't removed right away but instead is converted to Red Health which won't stop a character dying but will slowly turn back into normal health if the character isn't the active. Typically all characters have the same amount of max health, though the resident Tanks may get bonuses that increase this.\n\n2: Bar, or Mana: Generates when your character moves towards the opponent, on taking hits and when dealing out hits. Slowly building up and then spent for Special attacks and a few other things.\n\n3: Reaction. The Pro-Players ARE playing a real-time game, even if the actual real-life Player is not. This represents their ability to react swiftly and perform feats of skill, or even activate specific Pro moves like a combo extending beyond where it should without Resetting, or to otherwise seemingly-violate the in-universe game rules. This resource carries between games but not through the whole tournament and regenerates a bit when the player has time to relax a little, so Cinematics (ie Supers, Ults etc when not chaining), Kills/Deaths and between games. Between matches it is presumed it regenerates fully.\n\nPro-Player skill points can be spent reducing the Reaction cost of specific uses, representing them focusing on that type of combat over others and there are other methods of altering the amounts (some slow characters might cause the opponent to react more easily, while fast characters may raise the cost or remove the option entirely in certain scenarios).\n\nBlocking: Blocking and attacking are very important aspects of fighting games, and very interactive for the pro-players, so the same should be said in this game.    \n\nThere are 5 main options for an attacking player, repeated multiple times.\n\nLow attacks, blocked by Low-blocks. Normal attacks, blocked by Low-blocks and Normal-blocks. Overhead, blocked by Normal-blocks. Cross-up which forces the blocking player to turn around and then block. And finally the Grab which can only be stopped with an Anti-Grab. Certain characters combo in different ways, following two or three 'strings' although it is possible to go off the string to catch the blocker off-guard at the expense of shortening your block string substantially.\n\nThere is also bait and other complex moves but those would be Pro-Player skills that are unlocked and require Reaction.\n\nBlockers must predict the coming attack and block appropriately, guessing before the reveal of the attack's nature. If they guessed inappropriately they can spend some Reaction to react to the character's animation though over-use of this will lead to running out of the resource and losing hard.\n\nGame Modes:\n\nStandard: The basic campaign, dealing with the player character rising through the ranks towards the world championships.\n\nRetro Edition: All characters for the NPCs and PC are almost maxed out already, since all their tips and tricks have been explored in the years since it's release.\n\nDay 1 Tournament: You use the basic characters and so does everyone else, You cannot improve them, only your Pro-Player skills. A shorter game mode, only a single tournament in length, but if you complete it you unlock the 'Day 1 DLC' character to use in the other two game modes."
a6bizg,An IRL horror puzzle mystery.,"You are the security guard (five nights at freddies or nighttrap style gameplay) at a location where gunmen have entered the premises.           \n\nYou have to figure out what is occurring using your limited views and hoping you find the right camera when you hear a ""commotion"".       \n\nYou also have choices with regards to locking doors, say due to a fire escape policy, that if you close a door another will open.       \n\nSo you much make choices about the victims of the gunmen or if you take too long to choose which door you lock... the gunmen kill both rooms.        \n\nIt's basically a FNAF game with ethics problems like the trolley problem in them and the difficulty of trying to keep yourself and others alive while figuring out the mystery.         \n\nMaybe you could also give limited control over the people and a way to tell them how to get out, but give us problems like misinforming one group so they serve as a distraction for a much larger group to escape.         \n\nMaybe the smaller group has younger people or kids in it and might make you choose the older group based on a value judgement.

a6bbsg,Another creature creator game,"IMO, the most unique part about Spore isn't the evolutionary aspect (there have been games like that in the past, as well as games like that currently in development), or the gameplay, or the vehicle/building creators. No, the thing that sets Spore apart from all the other games I can think of is the creature creator.\n\nI can't think of a single game like that, that involves molding a body and adding various parts from a chart and picking various color patterns to create virtually any creature you can imagine. The closest I can think of is the game *Impossible Creatures*, which mainly involves just sticking parts from existing animals together, like a wolf's head on a scorpion.\n\nAs a creative biology-lover, I really wish someone would try to make a more advanced version of Spore's creature creator, where as well as the creature's appearance, you can also alter its behavior and diet."

Over time you can add new buildings/upgrades, which attracts more people and allows your village to get bigger and bigger (maybe eventully becoming a full blown city). You have to deal with problems such as monsters and bandits, plagues, famine, etc. Maybe have wandering adventurers come through town every now and then who will do quests for you. And you have to manage the town's resources such as gold/food/people to maximize the prosperity of your village. If something like this already exists, please point me to it!"
a678uq,Very specific and currently undoable idea of giant MMO,"**DISCLAIMER:** This might seem like duplicate of my previous posts, however here i will be trying to flesh the idea down to bone. This isn't vague idea, this is instruction for ""perfect"" This is my subjective view of things MMO. TL;DR will be availble at the end.\n\n**Required set-up and controls:** Game would use VR Goggles, 2D threadmill, leg and hand trackers. Hand trackers would have to track movement of fingers as well. Game would require connection to server. There are nigh no UI-s and no crafting in its traditional form - you create items by DYIing the hell out of this world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Servers:** No-one can play this game without connection to servers. They are required to handle physics part of game and host worlds. Servers would need to be basically supercomputers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gameplay** (along with tutorial)**:** Everything can be destroyed. You see this plant? There is a way for you to harvest it. even grass. You can just grab individual tufts and throw them in bag that you made, or get an animal-drawn mower. Possibilities are endless. GUI are in small amounts. First you'd have to choose server. After that you can see the ""core planet"". It's the planet on which you'll be able to safely breathe. you have to choose approximate landing site. Exact landing location would make sure that you land no closer than 50 meters from place another player was in during past hour, so you can think of it as players leaving ""no land zone"" that degrades after an hour. Upon landing your pod will kick you out, leave small crate and disintegrate itself. The crate would have hinges, in it there would be some knife, bag and a small hatchet. All of those tools would be very weak material, however crate would be undestructible. You can get it out of existence by press of set key on your controller. Same key will bring it back. This is your persistent storage. No force except that of yours applies to crate doors, not even the gravity. Keep your valuables there, you can always recall it.    Materials always behave same if subject to same conditions. There would also be some fantasy stuff, but it would follow strict laws. Magical items would be divided in four types: activators, active compounds, upgraders and containers. Activators have few subtypes: hit activator - activates compund only if it is smashed against it, touchstone -  activates compund if it touches the compound, and proximity activator - activates compound. Compounds are what gives the function to the magic. Some of them use up power some collect it and some just modify workings of other. For example one of them would make fire and other one would direct it. Power is just temperature, so you have to balance use of it so you don't scorch or freeze your spell-wielding creation. Upgrader can upgrade activator or compund to next level if melted together. Activator of level n can activate compound of level &lt;=n, compounds of higher levels are more effective. Upgraders can upgrade only from certain level to certain level. Containers have extremely high specific heat so they work as batteries. After death you have to take a brake for 20 hours from playing on this server (so if you have strict playtime you don't lose whole next day if you die towards end of your session, however the time may be adjusted by server owner, that's just standard) so getting surgeries is beneficial to the player in the way that he can come back to play later. If player quits while his character is wounded healing processes will slow down, and character won't dissapear as usually. However, character doesn't get hungry nor thirsty during healing if offline, and after full healing character just lays there until player relogs. When player quits game his character *ascends* and then bubbles himself out of existence, unless he bumps into something. Bubbling is fine tuned to keep equipment on player and not destroy surroundings.\n\n**Worlds:** Most worlds would use genetic algorithms to make life. Some could even simulate plate tectonics. Worlds would come in few tastes. The basic ones would be:\n\n* Basically Earth - pretty normal. Has real life vegetation, fauna and geography\n* The two lands - Has mostly landmasses, with a lot of small lakes. There are numerous interconnected caverns full of hot air and cold walls, so there can be creatures developed there. The caverns would be full of poisonous gases, so players wouldn't be able to traverse them.\n\n**Modes of selling:** Game would be sold in three sets: Standard edition, Lifetime server edition, Lifetime server and assistant. Server managment is hard, that's why there is set with assistant. Assistant would be paid for serving others with help on tuning server to desired parameters. There would be free ""Server assistant"" app that would allow users to help server owner with managing server. Access for the assistant would be  revoked if it was not extended for ten minutes or if password wielder decided to revoke it instantly. Password wielder would have final say about if the modifications get implemented or thrashed. It is basically creating separate folder that doesn't auto-overwrite the original server.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR:** It's VR game with 2D threadmill, finger and leg tracking. You craft stuff by using your skill not some artificial skill points and no crafting GUIs, players get few weak tools and persistent storage at first and can build up on it. You can have your own server and all life can be evolved on the server. You have to try keeping yourself alive if you want to bingeplay. There is magic but it's more of alchemy and yes you can airdrop magical flaming bombs from diesel powered plane. Also you need to connect on server cuz it needs f\*cking supercomputer to run."

a5zvf1,A simple way to make the battle system from Paper Mario: Sticker Star work,"I'm posting this here since it should probably be made into a game inspired by the battle system in Sticker Star.  I'd doubt the battle system itself would be very difficult to incorporate; I'd say \*Intermediate\* difficulty, if you're including action commands.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# The main criticisms of this system:\n\n* No incentive to battle (rewards are just coins, health, and stickers, which were all expended in the battle in the first place)\n* Strategy is too mindless and linear\n* No customization in combat\n* Not very engaging combat (too simple action commands)\n* No partners or badges (as in 64/TTYD)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe lattermost one is subjective, so I'm ignoring it (Yes, partner and badges are what made the older games good, but the elements from those games don't have to be the same elements that make every other PM good).  The others, though, are quite objective.  I'll try to solve them without changing the battle system itself too much.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# No incentive to battle\n\n`Problem:`\n\nI'm against the idea of EXP in RPGs.  It's an illusive incentive; it just makes battles mandatory rather than optional, unless you're good at dodging attacks, in which case, congratulations - You now have the option of playing less of the game...for being good at it.  The only good part to come out of it is when you get to choose what stat to increase (as with Mario RPGs), but this could be done without a leveling up system.\n\nThe MAIN problem with EXP, though, is that you're rewarded for completing each battle regardless of your skill.  If you take up too many turns, you take more damage.  If you take damage, it can usually be healed back up afterward no problem, or the HP loss won't matter and you'll survive until you can get to a rest area (to restore your HP) anyway, or dying won't matter, since you just lose a bit of progress, and reengage the battle you died in over and over until you eventually get lucky.  *The point is, when a battle is inevitable, you get the same amount of EXP no matter how good or bad you did.*\n\nSticker Star, in theory, fixed this problem: You get a net gain of ""EXP"" (stickers) from each battle depending on how resourceful (good) you were with your stickers.  If you use less stickers and win the battle, you get a net gain.  If you use too many, you get a net loss.  At least, this is how it **should** be.\n\nIn reality, each battle in SS nets you...one sticker, usually, and if you're lucky.  And just enough coins to barely make up for the stickers you used.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n`Solution:`\n\nSimply make battles give out more stickers and coins, and make stickers and coins more valuable.  If your Sticker Book is full, extra stickers should be converted into something else, so there's still an incentive to battle even if your inventory is full (maybe even more of an incentive to battle if this ""something else"" is extremely valuable, like EXP that grants permanent buffs).  However, you will only gain this ""something else"" if you are resourceful with your stickers such that you use no more stickers in the battle than you gain from it.\n\nWith this system, you slowly accumulate more, and better stickers if you're good, just like the devs intended, minus the ""if you're good"" part.  It makes each battle a risk-reward, rather than just a risk or just a reward.\n\nAlso, make coins buy stuff other than just stickers, even if it's just cosmetic stuff that doesn't aid you in combat.  It's still an incentive nonetheless.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Strategy is too mindless and linear\n\n`Problem:`\n\nCombat boils down to ""use X sticker on Y enemy.""  Enemies are flying, spiked, or semi-flying.  That's it.  Only one enemy has any interactions with other enemies, and that's the Koopa Troopa (and Buzzy Beetle).  It's way too easy to be as resourceful as possible with your stickers, since you just don't use hammers on flying enemies, and don't use jumps on spiked enemies.  That's it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n`Solution:`\n\nThe arrangement of enemies should matter.  A lot.  Like in old PM, hammers should only target the frontmost enemy, while jumps can target any enemy, but are weaker against enemies with Defense, which there should be more of.  Make the Hurlhammer exceptional by letting it target any enemy.  Don't make hammers attack multiple enemies.  Add stickers with more unique, situational effects, like increasing your attack, or decreasing the enemy's attack.\n\nAdd more unique interactions to enemies.  Take the Roller Guy from Color Splash, for example.  It's just immune to Hammer attacks, I believe.  Why not instead make it so that, when you attack it with a hammer, it takes no damage, but it gets knocked back into the enemy behind it, if there is one?  That way, when Roller Guy is the backmost enemy, you should use a jump attack, but, otherwise, you should use a hammer attack to do more damage.  This is **variable strategy**.  Now, combat is ""use X sticker on Y enemy if Y enemy is in one of many situations"" (like in old PM).  Much better.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# No customization in combat\n\n`Problem:`\n\nYour options in combat are purely based on what stickers you managed to accumulate so far.  You either happen to have an option for every situation, or none.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n`Solution:`\n\nTwo or more Sticker Books!  Whenever you gain a sticker, you choose one of multiple Sticker Books to put it in.  When you go into battle, you can only choose one of these Sticker Books to use.  You may sacrifice a turn to swap your Sticker Book.\n\nNow, with this simple additions, obtaining stickers is a lot less linear and a lot more customizable.  You get to make multiple ""arsenals"" of options, but you only have access to one of them at a time.  You must choose to have variety in your sticker book (hammers, healing, jumps, etc), or sacrifice variety for an advantage against certain enemies you've been encountering (all hammers against spiked enemies, for example).\n\nAlso, it would be cool if, each time you found an ""Hp-Up Heart,"" you could choose to raise HP, maximum inventory, maybe First Strike attack power, or even your odds of fleeing from a fight, eh?  More customization, more replayability.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Not very engaging combat\n\n`Problem:`\n\nAll action commands are either button mashes, motion controlled, or timing based.  Without variety, this makes battles get stale over time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n`Solution:`\n\nPerhaps the easiest to solve.  Add more action commands.  Precision, judgement, reaction, luck, speed, memorization, risk, and visual distinguishment are all examples of elements that can be incorporated into action events.  They can be even be mixed and matched with each other.\n\nYou also only ever use one button, A (I believe), for all action commands.  Change this up.  Add joysticks, more motion controls, other buttons, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Thanks for reading all the way through."
a5zisf,From Grace,"TL;DR- a secular retelling of the Christian creation myth that has you playing as Satan before and during his fall from Heaven. If you are religious and find the appropriation of the story to be distasteful... well I don’t really care, stories are stories, get in line behind all the people who hate historical fiction. \n\n\nThe Core Gameplay: platforming/puzzle solving, and melee/magical combat.\n\nStory: This is a narrated story as told by Satan, a human has managed to make contact with him and wants to know what really happened at the beginning of it all. Satan, though tired and a little impatient obliges the summoner and tells his side of the story. Which goes like this:\n\nGod has just finished creating everything and looks to his angels for congratulations. (God is a sad figure in this story, he’s the villain, but he’s not actively malicious, he’s more pathetic and lonely. Almost like a  lonesome old man who’s sorta kinda losing his mind) The angels are like a literal captive audience, but they don’t even know it. For whatever reason Lucifer was created with a more curious and probing mind, after being charged with looking after his father’s garden, he began noticing an odd trend. \n\nEverywhere he’d go, he find himself asking “Why?” Why did God create these things, why do they do what they do? What is the purpose in all of this? The Humans confounded him the most, they seem so much like the angels and yet they are so shallow, they eat, and sleep, and play. That is all, it seems to be all they ever desire. These troubles gave Lucifer vivid dreams, dreams in which he found the answers he sought.\n\nThrough his dreams he learned of the Tree of Knowledge. Desperate to talk to anyone about his doubts and his feelings but nobody would understand, he saw the tree as an opportunity. He brought some of it’s fruit back to heaven where he began to share it with his friends. For a moment Lucifer was content just to have his small group of allies to talk to about his misgivings, but soon he begins to look on the humans with pity. \n\nAt first he was resentful as any older child is when forced to look after the youngest, but soon he saw. The man and woman were God’s playthings, not even allowed to dress themselves. He realized the Earth was God’s playground, humanity his favorite toy, and the angels, though led to believe they are his children are much more akin to slaves and servants. \n\nLucifer begins to plot. He sees god as unfit for his position. He saw God for what he was, a being of such power and complexity that he cannot maintain a sensible consciousness for long periods of time. The “person” that god is, the father Lucifer loved, is merely a sliver of a vast expansive being. Imagine what would happen if a being too complicated to understand developed consciousness and started trying to understand itself. That’s God, and Lucifer is the only one who really sees how precarious of a position that places all of creation in. And so Lucifer would turn more angels over to his side, explaining to them God’s flaws and the danger everyone is in if he is allowed to continue creating and acting with impunity. \n\nWhile on earth he learned that god created all these ecosystems and living beings, but actively suppresses them, only allowing what he deemed acceptable to be perceived. Lucifer discovers that outside the garden all those suppressed emotions and instincts have manifested themselves into what would become known as demons. He pities them as much as he is disgusted by them. Their discovery only further encouraged Lucifer that his father was out of control.\n\nThere were minor skirmishes between loyal angels and The Enlightened as Lucifer and his allies began calling themselves, but God was too busy to notice. If he wasn’t looking in on his favorite little humans, then he was out in some corner of the universe doing who knows what. He hardly spent any time on the angels anymore. At a certain point Lucifer felt he had enough support to oppose God, but he didn’t want to simply overthrow his father, he wanted his father to see, to understand why they had no choice in the matter. So he devised a plan. He would give the fruit of the tree of knowledge to the humans and they would present God with Lucifer’s reasoning. He believed God would listen to them. \n\nLucifer made himself visible and waited by the tree of knowledge, Eve saw him and was curious. He explained how the fruit works, that it will give you the knowledge that god has, and so thinking it would bring her closer to god she took and ate the fruit. Lucifer bid that she returns to the tree every night so that they may speak and she may learn of the truth. She did as she was asked. Over time as she learned truths about her life, she began asking Lucifer many questions, some even he had not thought of. Her curiosity endeared her to Lucifer and soon he finds himself “catching feelings”, as the kids these days say, and struggles with these new emotions. He’s never felt anything akin to what he feels for Eve, he doesn’t want her harmed or unhappy in anyway, but he can’t lie to himself. He has really no idea how God will react to his plan, he may very well vaporize the lot of them as soon as they’ve finished speaking. \n\nHe begins doubting himself. Doubting that he made the right choice, and that he actually knows any better than god. Then God demands more monuments be built in heaven to honor him. It’s kind of the straw that breaks the camels back. When not actively in service to God angels are much like us, they have hobbies, they craft things, they practice talents and display them for the entertainment of their fellow angels. But whenever God is home all that goes away, and everyone is rushing around doing something for God, and this time he didn’t even have the courtesy to stick around and let everyone know what a good job they’re doing. He made his demands and then left. It was too much for Lucifer.\n\nHe gave fruit to Eve and told her to share her knowledge with Adam. She did, but unlike how Lucifer thought it would go, he became very upset. He blamed Eve for showing him these truths, and felt jealous over her sneaking off to meet Lucifer. He began striking her. Lucifer appeared in all of his divinity, intent on killing Adam, however God immediately perceived the threat to his human and returned, saving Adam at the last possible moment. \n\nLucifer came clean about his activities, hoping for some kind of understanding, instead God flew into a rage. He branded Lucifer as a deceiver, changed his name, and he banished the humans he’d tainted from his paradise. Satan and all those who followed him were cast out of heaven, leaving it practically empty, they were cursed to wander the earth forever. This doesn’t make Satan very popular amongst his peers. And thus he goes into hiding, only to come out when he feels particularly obligated to assist humanity. He accepts his responsibility for what happened, and so when times are especially dark, he reaches out and does what he can to brighten things up. God changed his name but he couldn’t change who he is. \n\nThe human summoner is stunned, he always thought Satan was some kind King of Hell type who delighted in all things miserable and vicious. Instead he finds a dejected and tired soul who’s hated by everyone, even other fallen angels. And even then this supposed villain still would occasionally find enough kindness in his heart to do what he little he could to help people.\n\nThe lesson in it all really is just, things aren’t always what they seem, and just because our logic is sound and our hearts are in the right place, doesn’t mean everything is going to work out okay in the end. Sometimes you just need to accept something, cause trying to change it will only make everything so much worse. Kind of a bummer of a lesson, but it’s one I wish some kind of media had exposed me to, as I’d grown up thinking that all you really needed was faith and if you thought something was wrong you stand up to it. It was never explained to me (not with words anyway) that sometimes you’re just too young, you don’t know better, you’re too wrapped up in your emotions to see the issues clearly and when you stand up you make a fool out of yourself, or worse you bring harsh consequences down on you and those around you thanks to your ignorance. \n\nGameplay Details:\nPlatforming is the bread and butter of the game, it is the primary fun-maker so to speak as you’ll be doing it a lot. Lucifer moves swiftly, while in heaven his feet never touch the ground, he hovers and flits about like a ghostly hummingbird, on earth however you are much more corporeal, you do have a double jump though.\n\nIn Heaven the puzzle platforming is mainly done inside Lucifer’s dreams. Every time he sleeps you play out a level that is meant to signify the growing of his doubts. Perhaps there’s leaks that need to be plugged on a massive ship and try as he might he can’t seem to get all of them. Other dreams show him visions of the Tree of Knowledge and he must run, jump, climb, and fight apparitions to reach the tree. Others are literal wrestling matches with his feelings for Eve. \n\nWhen Lucifer is on earth the platforming is less fantastical, and more grounded, Lucifer must actually run with his feet on the ground, leap, pull himself up ledges, and walk across narrow precarious paths . You’ll also encounter demons that you will need to fight. \n\nSpeaking of combat, there is a distinct difference between Heavens combat and Earth’s. In heaven Lucifer relies on magical abilities that allow him to attack from a distance or to simply engage large numbers up close. He uses light as a weapon. On earth he carries a short-spear, the blade is made of light, as it also acts as your torch when exploring outside of the garden. The blade grows as you successfully chain combos, it eventually looks like a glowing javelin, at that point you can throw the spear to deal a big burst of AoE damage that stuns enemies it doesn’t kill. \n\nThe gameplay mechanics really aren’t that terribly complicated, which is why I feel the look of them is important, the style with which Lucifer dispatches foes and traverse the maps needs to be indicative of who he is, it’s not just hacking and slashing, everything about the way he controls and the way he looks when in motion needs to inform the player, it shows them what kind of character this is. He is young (cosmically speaking), talented, a little hot headed, but not temperamental, or overly-confident. He’s an idealist. Someone who believes there’s always a right way to do something and strives to do it that way every time. You need to see that when you play so when it goes to a cutscene and Satan is talking, you wonder “What happened to him?”  Hopefully this engenders a sense of curiosity in the player and draws them into the game further. \n\nIf you want to imagine an art style, I like to think of it as taking on the style of that X360 game, *El Shaddai: Ascension of the Metatron*, which funnily enough also dealt heavily in Religious Iconography. \n\nAnyway that’s pretty much it. Blasphemous as it is. If you’ve got any questions about story or anything just ask I’m happy to oblige. "
a9hsnj,Meditative Farming Game - Casual/Simulation,"I find myself playing ARK: Survival Evolved just to make a camp in the Redwoods. The lighting and ambiance is really soothing. If you need a game idea, you should try to make a game with beautiful scenery, for the purpose of relaxation and meditation. Farming simulator is fun... but I don't want my end goals to be money or reaching the next level, and I want it to be first person. Perhaps with VR compatibility. I want to wander in a beautiful forest, walk or fly through large beautiful mountains. I want to create a small garden and grow vegetables and tend chickens, but much faster than real life.

a9dn4j,Medieval Realism combined with 'grounded' or Folklore Fantasy?,"What about a game that does 'Fantasy' with Medieval Roleplaying Elements according to the suggestions of YouTubers' like Skallagrim or Shadiversity of how they would respond in conjunction with their existence to make it more realistic?\n\nAs in all the armours, attitudes, weapons, buildings, clothing and etc of the human societies are done as accurately to match real medieval standards as much as possible. While at the same time you have added at the same time folklore creatures and 'paranormal' phenomena that accurately match the depictions of medieval people.\n\nIn short imagine if Medieval people lived to see video games and developed a fantasy medieval game based on their experiences/culture.\n\nWhen it comes to huge beasts you sometimes cannot take them along, but it requires getting lots of people involved throwing spears, shooting arrows at it, lots of pikes pointed and possibly a ballista. And maybe not all creatures can be fought conventionally in the game."
a9a0h3,a warhammer 40k single player action game,"Ok so I was thinking there should be a game about becoming a Space Marine of a few of the major chapters such as blood angels and ultramarines, you choose your faction and you get a predefined story about your life on your death world or hive city. Then at a certain point you get chosen by the faction to become a Space Marine and play out the trials and tribulations of becoming one, eventually becoming chapter master or commander by the end.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was thinking this would only work if you got to play as a marine from the major chapters as in the ones directly made and serve the primarch that sired them, such as the salamanders.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThink Darksiders 1 with how the game play was presented and the story was told, or just Warhammer 40k Space Marine but only playing out the life before being one, becoming one and serving as one. Plus the selection of different chapters, each with the playable character having different personalities.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n and those would mean that the player would learn about the chapter, they're creed what they strive for and the hypnotraining can be done through cutscenes and with hallucination it can be played out like hellblade's hallucination scenes, maybe with a mini game attached to keep your sanity in check/ psyker powers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nkeep in mind the training would only be part of the game, life on the death world/ hive city would used to tell the player about such places, who's in charge and what not, in fact with a death world it could be that after like 10 missions with the player finally being the leader of a major tribe and then be told you have been selected by whichever chapter uses that world like the salamanders.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nsuch an example would not only give the player more lore about 40k (because i don't think many people look into it thats not already interested) but it also furthers the understanding of the chapter and how they gather recruits, this game would be designed for multiple play through's one for each chapter"

a8v7j9,Truly unique Items tied to players in online RPG's,"First off, this is more of an idea for a game mechanic in general and not a game in itself. Also the idea is based on the ExtraCredits video about Blockchain technology. (They do a lot of talking about game development).  \nLink to video that inspired the idea (\~7min): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywvTIM\_eOVI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywvTIM_eOVI)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDescribed in short (and correct me if I'm wrong), Blockchain ensures that a digital object is unique and non-duplicateable, as well as being owned by the player.\n\nPersonally, i think the idea of having a unique item is especially alluring to a RPG / MMORPG playerbase, especially if the item is also useful. \n\nAn example could be a decent staff worn by player A, which (s)he uses for quite a time and names with a naming mechanic, but eventually replaces and sells to a vendor. When the staff is ""released"" into the game system it could gain attributes (bonus for relating this to the specific player) such as +fire damage if player A was a fire mage. Later on, player B finds this (now somewhat more powerful) named staff originally wielded by player A and decides to use it until (s)he finds a better weapon. The staff could get released into the system again, becoming more powerful as it has been used for different deeds. Eventually this staff may pass down as one of the greatest staffs in the game as it's legacy grows and could possibly return to the original wielder of the weapon.\n\nApparently this Blockchain Technology would allow for such a system to exist, but I imagine such a system might also work on a smaller scale if a game allowed for ongoing creating of new items. Though i am no developer, so what do i know.\n\nMore specific and personal thoughts on the concept as for how it could be used as a gameplay-mechanic (or how problems could easily occur), as the idea above is the general gist of the idea and far from refined:\n\n\-Unique items should have their usage history accessible, such as original user, list of users, feats attained while wearing the item and so on. Even personal anecdotes/comments added by users to the item could be a thing, adding sentimental value to the unique items. Without this, they would really just be items with a name and perhaps other stats, but with this kind of feature, unique items could have a history of their own.\n\n\-Personally i think unique items should only increase in power when released into the system, like being sold to a vendor or thrown away. If unique items were simply items with another name there wouldn't be much to them, but if they scale in power as you used them, there would be no real reason to ever release them into the system, which in turn would rob other players of the joy of finding unique items when adventuring. \n\n\-Problem: Power scaling of unique items breaking the game: This could perhaps be done with a hidden-EXP system for unique items, which would then ""level"" the item and give it new attributes as it was released to the loot tables of the world. Implementing this would also allow for management of a power ceiling for unique items in a way so that they don't break the game completely.\n\n\-Problem: Bulk ""unique"" items flooding the game: If every item is unique, no item is unique - so implementing a naming/engraving system to mark which items are unique could be a benefit, such that not every item ever worn by any player becomes special. Also, a game would probably benefit from having loads of in-game items already, with the unique items being variations of these items that grow in power as they are used to accomplish feats.\n\n\-Problem: Unique items getting hoarded: Unique items could hold sentimental and gameplay value, so it could be a reason for a player to keep the items, to use on alts or to sell to other players. A ""fix"" to discourage hoarding could be a soft cap or hard cap to the amount of unique items you could own, creating a balance between the items you save for yourself and the unique items players can discover when adventuring.\n\n\-Problem: Naming unique items: Find a sword of xXxPenetrationxXx or robes of YoMama might break immersion depending on the overall game atmosphere, so regulating names might be a good idea - or a bad one. This entire idea could easily turn into a trollfest, but ways could probably be found around that.\n\n\-This one might be far fetched, but giving set bonuses for wearing unqiue items originally owned by the same player could be a cool feature, as it would give any unique item the potential to be worthwhile keeping/trading.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease feel free to comment, add thoughts, constructively criticize or explain why this idea is far-fetched and could never possibly become a thing. Personally I find the concept incredibly intriguing and i think any form of online RPG's is a type of game where this really might shine. \n\nOr, if you know somewhere except crypto-collectible games where such a mechanic is used, feel free to add that."
a8tyk6,Human simulator.,"Think of it as, like, DayZ but without the zombies. You get the point. Initially you gather resources, then you have to build farms to stay alive. \nWill players fight for resources? Probably. \nWill players create a government? Maybe. \nWhat I think is going to happen? Players will initially scavenge a lot, and I mean A LOT. Then they will start to fight for resources, initially like an FFA, later players will form groups themselves in an effort to live together. As players get enough resources, fighting will become rare and the groups will stay groups, now merely organizations that farm together and protect eachother. This is very unlikely, however. \n\nWhat do you think?"

a8ivpo,An idea for Phineas and Ferb game where you mainly play as Agent P.," \n\n**Premise**:The Flynn Fletchers won a ticket to all expense paid cruise trip across the Pacific Ocean after Phineas and Ferb won an online essay contest. Unfortunately, Dr Doofenshmirtz was also able to board the cruise after Norm (for some reason, he is legally considered to be Dr Doofenshmirtz's son) also won the contest.Now, Agent P have to use all his skills to thwart his nemesis's scheme while simultaneously avoiding detection from his host family for the duration of the cruise.\n\n**Gameplay**: Since most of Dr Doof's schemes are extremely near Phineas and Ferb's activities , a stealth based gameplay is encouraged.Perry has an ""Agent"" mode, which is useful for combat ,hacking and object manipulation but it significantly decreases your stealth and a ""Pet"" mode ,which is useful for avoiding any suspicion from the Flynn Fletchers(or any other significant character).In most of the levels( which are called ""Episodes"" in this game), there are multiple ways to defeat Dr Doof, and some episodes have multiple endings, that would have a major effect on the next ""episode"".For example, If you violently beat up Dr Doof for a scheme that he himself admitted that has no real evil purpose in one episode,he is not going to help you defeat a mysterious rogue agent onboard the cruise on the next episode, and he would instead attempt to join forces with the rogue agent."
a8ildl,"A story-driven game where the driving story element is a war, but play through much of the game without knowing which side you're on","Due to ambiguous writing, it is unclear to the player which side of the war they are fighting for in some portion of the game, either the first few chapters, half of the game, or somewhere near the end.

a8ijes,Another damn BR,"Alright hear me out. I know BR has been done to death and frankly i'm kind of sick of it too, but I feel like they're getting old because it's essentially the same idea every time. They're all fairly quick games where you're dropped into a world full of everything you need right off the bat. I don't want that. Instead of a quick BR game, I want a game where it takes a couple of weeks for the zone to close in. If you've ever been addicted to Rust like I have, you'd be used to the long server wipes and the slow growth of materials and loot. Picture that, but with the constant threat of a closing zone that not only shrinks, but randomises its movement every day. This prevents some guy from setting up a nice base in the middle of the zone and watching everyone else struggle. By doing this, it means that everyone has to deal with abandoning their base and moving, or logging on at a certain hour to escape before the slow zone engulfs them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow you might be like ""Ey my guy, what's stopping people from just joining in straight after they're dead? That ruins the whole idea of Battle Royale"". And yeah, it does - But I don't want it to be easy for them. If you try and join the server after the first 3 days or so, or after you've already died, you spawn in as a light scavenger. In this state, you're unable to open doors, build bases, or use anything beyond basic weapons. You're also unable to kill other scavengers, which creates a growing horde enemy for survivors to deal with. After killing (a particular number of) actual contestants, you're automatically reinstated into the game as a contestant yourself. This gives players who have died some motivation to rejoin and try to kill the people who are still playing. Even if it's REALLY difficult.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo add to the immersion, I think it'd be neat if the zone's movement wasn't readily available to the public. They'd have to craft items in-game, like a simple wind sock to indicate the zone's approximate movement over the next day or so. This could expand all the way up to a radar item that could be placed in their base to let the player know exactly how long they had before the zone reached them. No vehicles either. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nListen maybe this whole idea is a bit far-fetched or old, but I just feel like it's an angle that hasn't been tackled yet and could be really interesting to explore."

a7zu6i,A writer simulator where every little decision is included.,"You will be given options you have to pick as the production goes on.\n\nObviously, first you have to pick genre for your book or series.\n\nBut also, you have to pick a setting that the whole thing will take place in.\n\nStuff like: is this real world or a fictional one?\n\nIf it's real world, which country it takes place in? At what year exactly?\n\nIf it's a fictional one, you have to spend some extra time making background for it. \n\nThen you have to design the characters, minor ones, major ones, protagonists, antagonist.\n\nPick their traits, stats, personality, maybe physical description etc.\n\nThen you have to go part by part of every single chapter.\n\nYou have to pick what is happening, to whom, how does it relate to previous stuff.\n\nAs the production progresses you have to pick stuff like:\n\n"" scene is about how (Character A) spends some with (Character B) in a (one of available locations) ""\n\nYou have to then go into ""scene mode"" where you pick what sort of emotions characters are feeling, how do they show it, how does their dialogue go what are their wearing, what happens around them.\n\nSomewhat in a way that you pick ""Add start of dialogue"" ""Set the tone of the line""\n\nAnd as such, line by line, scene by scene, chapter by chapter you make a story.\n\nYou have to make sure that your story is not too generic, but at the same time it should have some logic in it.\n\nFor example you shouldn't make a character that was established to be an empathic pacifist to just go break into prison and shot a serial killer right between the eyes.\n\nThen, as you finish with your movie/book/episode, it get's published and game calculates what does people think about it.\n\nNot only a 1-10 rating from the critics, but also depending how you wrote the whole thing.\n\nFor example if you had your romantic comedy end with main characters dying together in peace, you will get fans that prefer some heavy stuff, while if you made an entire thing goofy and over the top, your fans will be people that prefer lighthearted stuff.\n\nIf you keep on making books with similar setting you will get a reputation depending on what sort of genre and theme you use. That way enthusiasts will become more devoted to you, and will not only grow, but will most likely buy your books sooner than later.\n\nIf you keep on trying a new stuff, you will get a reputation of ""flexible"". While you will have only few most devoted fans, you will have a bigger chance of attracting peoples that are not your fans. Kinda a gamble really.\n\nYour fans will also send you messages with feedback, praise, criticism and other stuff that will help you write future works. (Keep in mind thought that you have to still think for yourself, not everyone will like the idea of brooding anti-hero in your next fairy tale book)\n\nI just want to have a writing simulator that is semi-realistic and shows how much of time and effort it takes to make a single work, and how good it feels once you realize that people like it."
a7zquu,Bushido Baseball,"In Medieval Japan, warrior clans compete in a baseball tournament to decide the next shogun.  The game is like old school SNES baseball, specifically Dolucky's Kusa Yakyu, only the pitcher throws a ninja star or throwing knife instead of a ball, and all players have swords.  A perfect pitch can kill the batter, and the pitch can be deflected just right to kill the pitcher.  Outfielders can rush and attempt to kill the batter, who is only ""safe"" while touching a base.\n\nThe batting and combat come from Bushido Blade, specifically deflecting projectile weapon attacks with your sword and running around the map one-hit killing ninjas.  Players would belong to one of four classes; samurai, ninja, geisha, or kunoichi; each class having its own skill tree like in Diablo II.  I see the graphics as low-poly 3D with fixed camera angles and pixel art style.  Story/lore would be reminiscent of Blood Bowl, told through color commentary and one or more cut scenes.  Overall ""feel"" of the game would be like a Medieval Japan baseball version of Mutant League Football with added RPG elements, e.g., level up and skill tree progression."

ab9apv,An RPG where conflict is as much internal as it is external,"Meet Mike. You are [not] Mike.\n\nMike is a complicated man, with desires, needs, and whole personality. You should know, you're a significant *part* of that personality.\n\nOn the outside, you're doing RPG things with Mike, facing down whatever enemies and frenemies, and other challenges, like any good old game gives you. On the inside, you're competing with Mike, or indeed negotiating with Mike, for superiority and agency. Do you need to dominate and control Mike, but not *be* Mike? Would you rather Mike stop existing altogether, and you be the only one playing? Do you coexist with Mike, or submit to his will? Beware that if you drag him around too much, he might dissociate and/or go crazy.\n\nWhy is Mike a man? We have women who play games too! Yes we do, and if Mike is a woman, then she's not going to want to be called Mike any more, is she?\n\n\nThe point is that the game is playing you as much as you're playing it. You, the player, are being studied and psychoanalysed. Your personality is being grafted onto the existing personality of this 'Mike' character. If they complement each other, it'll be easier to steer Mike around and perhaps replace him entirely. If not, it's still possible, but you'll have to go slow and steady about it. Being consistent in your behaviour and choices also helps achieve this. Meanwhile, at some points, Mike's going to want to do his own thing. Gentle persuasion might mean that Mike's 'own thing' is exactly what you would do... i.e Mike is becoming you, playing as you, rather than vice-versa.\n\nYou don't have to 'beat' Mike. You can if you want to. You can be a willing passenger on his journey, or he can be the passenger on yours.\n\nI really don't know how any of this can make sense, or how to put it into a game, but I got a bit inspired by the latest Black Mirror where it comes to sharing control with an actual, fleshed out character, rather than being 100% in control. I figure it doesn't necessarily *have* to be a matter of that character being completely batshit, but could be an exploration of the perpetual question of identity."

ab69e5,A game where you play as nature and it's your goal to have a world which as much life and biodiversity as possible,"A win would be a rainforest or maybe something even better. A loss would be a dessert. Challenges include evasive species (haven't decided whether this includes humans) and weather. You can control weather to a certain extent to fend off evasive species (I saw a video where a forrest in the US reintroduced wolves, and it changed the whole park to become more green because they ate evasive species), but you mainly use other species or DNA points to change species in order to create a balance. If a bug begins to eat all the plants, you can create a new disease which might have effects on something else, or you can upgrade or introduce an animal that eats these bugs, but these might also eat something that is beneficial. You constantly have to weight pros and cons in order to make your nature the biggest and most powerful. "
ab5k8z,Stealth-based vampire game in the vein of the Theif games.,"Basically you play as a vampire girl trying to survive in a modern day city. It would have a lot of horror themes to it (only you're the monster this time) and would revolve sneaking into homes and apartments at night, stealing from blood banks and avoiding the police/FBI as well as criminals roaming the streets. \n\nThis game should make the players feel bad about what they do as it depicts vampires in a horrific and gruesome way, but also shows that they only do what they must to survive.

ab2fax,"minecraft/EVE:online style MMO, but the game world resets to zero if the players don't save the world","So, one server MMO; \n\n*  player driven economy through an auction house and contracts\n  * seed items and money can be procured through questing\n\n* PVP is always on\n * players can teach one another combat or crafting skills\n* One centralized city, the farther you get from the city the more dangerous it gets\n * Players can make outposts and townships outside of the city ala minecraft and boundless\n\n* On death you lose your items \n\n* every time the gameworld resets the procedural generation kicks in and the entire world is regenerated from scratch (different monster spawns, landscape, resource spawn areas etc)\n\n* every time the big bad is defeated, it resets the timer and he'll come back stronger (on a curve), and different.\n\n\nThe Main design thrust with this is creating a social, player driven MMO with alot of potential for emergent game-play. Players need to rely on one another or else everything just falls apart and the world ends. Everyone loses everything. And when everyone loses everything the entire status quo gets shaken up, suddenly there isn't the one guild or oligarchy of guilds with a stranglehold on talent and horded wealth. Its a free-for-all every so often and new and exciting bonds and betrayals can happen!\n\nAlot of the core concepts are very well tread upon but i feel adding real stakes to an MMO could be very fun to play in and/or watch. Power creep, inflation, wealth hording, and invested labor have always made MMOs really imbalanced for new players, but I feel this would be a much healthier small-mid-sized MMO."

aaqyrr,Idea for a story game set in a very cold climate in which the main characters story is told through flashbacks triggered by environment or activities,"A first person, relatively short narrative set in a snowy area where the protagonist lives alone in a cabin... no electricity so candles and fires for atmosphere and such\n\nstory is told by like activities the narrator is doing... no voice over btw just music and atmospheric ambience... but like the protagonist would be chopping wood in the evening and when he bends down to pick up a piece of wood it would trigger a flashback in which he was picking up a ball from when he was a child (all memories still take place in the same area around his old home in which he now lives) or when he looks across a frozen pond it would trigger a memory of him skating with a girl he liked... \n\nstory basically along the lines of he lives alone in a cabin having to hunt and stuff (not survival just implemented chores into story) and while he doesn’t suffer from amnesia or anything his life story is just told through flashbacks. possibly he lived there with parents before and had a couple friends that would come over and then showed memories of them and one could be a love interest who he ends up marrying and then she dies of hypothermia or something which is made known at the end of the story for an emotional climax... \n\nidk i guess i just want a super nice looking first person atmospheric story teller like just something i think would be super cool to see\n\nForgive all my grammar and punctuation errors... wrote this in like 3 minutes only caring about getting the idea across"
aaoj30,"An FPS where your gun can shoot many different things, but every so often, certain abilities will be removed from the gun.","# Gameplay\n\nSo the player starts with a gun called the Matter Morpher, which can shoot almost anything you can dream of. Bullets, Rockets, Lightning, Flames, Balls that reflect off of surfaces, etc! It also has a soul inhabiting it, and a personality. But near the beginning of the game, your gun gets attacked with a digital virus. (this makes sense because your gun is energy based with lots of electronics.)  During certain events, your gun will lose a shooting type. These events will cause a random ability to be lost, or 1 ability that will always be lost during every play-through. \n\n# Story\n\nI could imagine the story being similar in concept to Xenoblade 1. Two races inhabit a planet, Athreans and Sprawlers. The Athreans are human like aliens, with advanced technology and intelligence, but weak defenses. The Sprawlers are physically strong with a very tough hide, but they are a simpler race, run by many different chiefdoms. These races have always been hostile at times, even at the point of war occasionally. In one of the major Athrean cities, a young man named Flindrake, go through a coming of age ceremony. During this, he is encountered with the Matter Morpher, to see if it considers him a worthy user. He sees that he is a stronger Athrean, and can feel the hatred for the Sprawlers in his conciseness. He finds him as a worthy subject, and chooses him as his user. Flindrake then gets in contact with the Athrean council, and gets hired as a super soldier to fight in a surprise war against the Sprawlers.\n\n# What I need\n\nFeedback! I need to know if this would make for a good game, or if it should be something else entirely. Also, maybe come up with some more shooting types?"
aao2nu,Silent Shooters,"This is the premise of a multiplayer FPS. A bunch of sumo wrestlers with huge hitboxes are dropped onto a very small flat wasteland. Nobody can see: everyone's screen is black. People must use their headphones to locate others and shoot eachother. People must keep moving, but their sumo wrestler footsteps are very loud and the loudness is proximity based. If you stop moving for five seconds you become visible on everyone's screen until you start moving again. Rounds are short and contain approximately 16 people. A visible forcefield closes in as time goes on that brings the final players closer together. Everyone has unlimited ammo, but only one bullet in the chamber and it takes 2 seconds to reload. You're shots are also loud and may give away where you are.\n\nI think this would be a really cool game for anyone who is blind, or just wants to experience something a bit different."
aal5a6,Not shitty Second Life,"Completely serious on this one, wrote a pretty kickass core backbone for a MMO in unity with C# already. I was thinking of building a mostly first person second life with, less-than horrendous graphics, procedural voxel terrain with parcels for building and resource gathering obtainable in a similar fashion to the homestead act using in-game currency. The game will be free but since I'm a cashwhore and probably having a kid to pay for around the time I have something worth advertising, it'll be slightly pay to win with, at a point certain elements as far as up-scaling becoming only obtainable with real currency unless you have a steady means of in-game income from something like being a landlord or the always available option of no-lifing the shit out of the system working your way up which will be at-least somewhat realistically viable granted you're willing to put the time in (cough cough unlike second life, con-artist asshats lmfao), I digress; other aspects include a starting city for public testing then hopefully proc. generated in the future. Design pictured from the inside out starting with a local government district where you have municipal buildings, county jail, patent office where you can import user generated content; 3d models and animations for personal use and moderated market-placing but designed using precious resources only used for inventing then built with regular resources the size of the import and materials it consists of determines the cost of design and assembly, other buildings like the town hall where you can rent in-town property that would be located past the municipality; player run shops for selling, buying and trading goods followed by residential property customized either by a selection of house frames with the intentions of building with gathered resources or coming pre-built with optional coloring and coming empty unless purchased from a player. Outside of the city are free plots with short term rental that regenerate after expiration used only for resource gathering, past those is voxel land that you can rent in various sizes and past a certain point you aren't restricted to what you can build. Restrictions are strictly to reduce griefing considering there will always be people out solely to ruin the fun. elsewhere are private player controlled ""sectors"" which are essentially servers with private parcels for you, your friends and other co-creators separate from public servers free to host on your own hardware for reasonable sized sectors with the option of renting a permit for anything bigger than 20 or so acres which is probably sufficiently large enough for 10 friends two acres each. TLDR; take second life and imagine a lovechild with the objective based on realism and creativity, by pairing it with the best aspects of Rust, Minecraft and 7 days to die and the end result is my shitty Frankenstein of stolen ideas because I'm utterly autistic when it comes to creativity. I'm most likely going to waste the next year or two of my life building this. UNLESS someone has an idea for an original survival game that hasn't been done a trillion times."

aaj5gk,A Jumanji inspired rpg,"I recently had a dream about being in a more immeraive version of Jumanji, and today read what seems like Jumanjis spiritual successor, Zathura, and now I kind of want an rpg game inspired by both franchises and Dnd.  It would preferably have original character creation, and similar to dnd each adventure would be in different locations.  As opposed to fantasy though, it would have more of a realistic fiction feel.  You could do an obscure jungle like Jumanji, England during the time of the Black Death, maybe even have your GM illustrate a crusade scenario.  Restricting it to the original games 2-4 players, youd do dice rolls to play out different scenarios and could either be a friend or foe to your teammates, completing the adventure as one or throwing your teammates under the bus to achieve a solo victory.\n\nThis is more of something I'd like to see than a fleshed out game idea, which is why I'm sucking at explainign it, but I'm curious if anyone would be interested"

You can send agents(you choose how many) to kill targets or steal secret stuff. \n\nThere are consequences for each choice you make and your agents can die. You can even lose your job or go to jail(game over) if you screw up really bad. "

a9vnjp,Thirdperson camera idea for PvP games,What if the thirdperson camera was a drone or some sort of insect/bird that was flying after you that other people could see? That would eliminate the ability to hide behind a corner and peak it with a thirdperson camera without anyone on the other side having any idea about it. \n\nPossibly even have the camera as a gear loot for battle royales where it can also be shot and broken so you would have to be careful with it / only use it when absolutely necessary.

a9qvuk,Platformer based on medieval illuminated manuscripts,"This idea is for art style and theme, no game mechanics.  I'd like to play a game that feels like a playable medieval illuminated manuscript.  Like how Cuphead feels like a playable 1930s cartoon.\n\nIlluminated manuscripts contain weird drawings of knights fighting rabbits and snails, elephants with trunks that look like brass horns, and demons wearing priestly garments, among other strange and fantastic things.  The imagery is just as weird and surprising as Japanese yokai or the nonsensical enemies in old games.  It's not something I've ever seen in games either.\n\nThe source material is all public domain, so you wouldn't have to worry about copyright.  It would just take a lot of time to research.\n\nFor story, something authentically medieval involving alchemy and magicians.  The game could feel like a cryptic instruction manual, recipe book, or bizarre allegory.  To do this right would take tons of research and consulting with historical/literary experts, but it's not an unachievable goal.  Just off the top of my head, The Book of Lambspring (1556) could serve as a basic template for a game with fifteen levels.\n\nCalligraphic text in Old English could provide story/lore as well as clues for an adventure game element--say, for example, you have to combine ingredients or use an unusual object as a key to exit a level.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Smithfield Decretals (late 13th or early 14th century):\n\n[http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/record.asp?MSID=6549&amp;CollID=16&amp;NStart=100504](http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/record.asp?MSID=6549&amp;CollID=16&amp;NStart=100504)\n\nOther examples:\n\n[https://io9.gizmodo.com/bizarre-and-vulgar-illustrations-from-illuminated-medie-1456202572](https://io9.gizmodo.com/bizarre-and-vulgar-illustrations-from-illuminated-medie-1456202572)\n\nThe Book of Lambspring (1556):\n\n[https://www.compendiumnaturalis.net/the-book-of-lambspring-1556/](https://www.compendiumnaturalis.net/the-book-of-lambspring-1556/)\n\nRock Paper Shotgun article about the potential for authentically medieval games:\n\n[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2017/08/16/middle-ages-rpg/](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2017/08/16/middle-ages-rpg/)"
a9nlia,Best fishing mechanics for casual game?,"I have played many casual games that have fishing, and all of them have either annoying or boring fishing mechanics. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn Stardew Valley, even though I would love to go fishing and collect fish, the fishing mechanics are so annoying that I don't even bother doing anything related to fishing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn Terraria, if you dont have any good fishing items, fishing is just boring and random, just sitting there doing nothing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd in most other casual games, fishing is just simply click, wait, and click again when a fish bites, the end.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you could have any fishing mechanics in a game that could make fishing fun and interesting but while still maintaining the casual style, what would you have?

a9lm56,Alternate reality game - phone,"I know there are some mobile games that require you to research the internet and social media to find clues and answers to questions it asks. Here is an example called NoStranger that does that: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.BVP.NoStranger&amp;hl=en_US\n\nMy idea was to make something similar. But instead of searching the internet for clues , you had to call various phone numbers.  For instance you call phone numbers and obtain part of a passcode. The user arranges the small passcodes obtain to form one large passcode. Then he calls a phone number and enters the passcode to receive the next instructions. And you know those phone menus that operate by your voice, so you could just speak out the password or a phrase. In addition to phone automated messages and menus , talking to a real person on the phone is something that I'd like. You would also get callbacks, plus there would be real sms texting too. So I imagine the  costs for maintaining phone numbers and creating virtual call systems would be expensive. But if anyone is aware of a free solution then I'd definitely give it a try and make the game myself. "

ad83nj,A game inspired by The Glitz Pit in Paper Mario TTYD,"The glitz pit has always been my favorite of the paper Mario chapters. It’s so interesting and I feel like it could be tweaked and expanded upon into a full game.\n  There are games *like* it, but not exactly what I’m envisioning. They don’t have the same spirit at all. The core is what needs to stay the same.\n\nImagine your character is an aspiring fighter, or whatever it is. It’s about competing against others and you’re putting on a show for tv and the crowd. \nSo your character up and leaves their life and joins. You work your way into it and earn your place and your name. And then you’re part of the championship. \n  Maybe there are several different arenas(for lack of better word at the moment) and each one of these areas will be a different chapter in your game. Each area will have its own story you’ll have to complete on top of winning the competitions. \n\nAs you progress you earn different perks, some to help in battle against your opponent, some perks are for pleasing the crowd. Because a big thing is you are putting on a show and have to make the crowd love you too. \n\n\nIt would have heavy rpg mechanics, turn based combat, and would have mystery and exciting stories to uncover. \n\nI’m not saying I’m making this game, obviously not. It would cost millions to make probably. But this is my dream game. And maybe some of you are millionaires and can make it happen. Anyway. Good day. "
ad7hz3,Zombie Survival [with twists],"First post to reddit, came here for this community! \n\nAbout me: I’m an amateur game dev (been doing art for years but finally jumping into coding and developing in Unity). I love all the unique ideas and coming here to get my thoughts going. I believe that, as Indie Developers, it’s our job to create truly unique game experiences that the big developers would never touch due to the high amounts of risk.\n\nCore Idea: Psionic zombies, mutant zombies, good ol’fashioned zombies. Players are dropped into a zone  and have to complete random tasks based on the character type they choose (tbd) such as paint a target for a drop or a tactical assault (if you’re playing a military character), get to your family and rescue or kill them (if they are zombified), bring the electrical grid back online, clear the hydro dam of dead bodies to make it work for the settlement downstream, etc.\n\nStandard Mechanics: \n - Noise draws old fashioned zombies [ofz] and mutants\n - Electrical signals draws psionic zombies [pz]\n - First player to complete their task wins points with points decreasing for every player that finishes their task thereafter with stats (comparative to character chosen) being additional points/bonuses.\n\nTwist Mechanics: \n - Can work as a team with other players (queue as a group to split rewards and points [higher success chance but less overall reward potential])\n - Being killed by zombies gives you two options\n     a. New character dropped into map with new random objective, loss of points but gets you back into the action quickly\n     b. Spawn as a zombie of the type that killed you (ofz, pz, mutant) and try to keep other players from achieving their goals. Kills grant you points which you can use to create a new character with more gear based on how well you perform. You can’t get win points as a zombie so there is tradeoff for each game mode.\n\nWin Condition:\nComplete your randomly assigned task. \n\nLoss Condition: Exit game or all players are dead simultaneously. I’m not quite sure how to handle this condition as far as points go, does nobody get any points? If the loss is due to all players dead, should I calculate the number of player kills made by each zombie and give points based on that?\n\nI think the biggest design challenge is, “What keeps the players engaged between matches?”\n"
ad1w8r,Harvest Moon meets Frontier Town Builder,"**OVERVIEW:** Imagine a story-driven *Harvest Moon* or *Stardew Valley* style RPG, but in addition to farming you also help to design, build and grow the town you live in or just outside of, attracting new residents and building up from a small, remote outpost into a bustling city.\n\n**SETTING:** Could be anywhere rural in any time period, but specifically I imagine a frontier town of the ""Wild West"" of America in the 1800s. But, like I said, anywhere ""frontier"" works - even a Fallout-style sci-fi wasteland, for example.\n\n**BACKGROUND:** I came up with the idea for this game when wondering ""100 years ago, how would a towns/villages/etc. start?"" Who ""starts"" a town, and why? How do they grow from nothing but empty land to a collection of shops, hotels, etc.\n\nWhen you play *SimCity* or *Tropico*, for example, you're taking a barren plot of land and building something on it more or less from scratch. \n\nBut, in the real world, not all cities or villages are ""planned"" in the sense that one person just took some empty space, started building roads and zoned some space for houses and factories to appear.\n\nInstead (though I absolutely admit I am no expert on this), I imagine most cities grow much more *organically* around just one business or residence, as there might be a nearby resource to harvest and sell (i.e. gold, fertile land, fresh water, etc.) or a good place to rest and/or trade goods and resources. From there other, others businesses decide to move nearby, the people who work there need somewhere to live, those new residents require goods and services, the cycle continues and the city grows organically around that one starting point.\n\nSo, in this game, you start as an individual who has either built a small camp/farm/mine/etc., or has created an inn for travellers to stop at along a busy route. From those humble beginnings, you meet and convince others to move in and, as this cycle continues, a town organically builds up around you. Every resident that moves in has their own story and their own problems, and the game becomes the story of how all these people come together and form a community, with the player character being the de facto leader.\n\nRather than being a *top-down* city-builder like *SimCity*, *Banished* or *Tropico*, I imagine the player's perspective of the game is from the *ground-up* as a character in the world. Instead of having a God-like overview of the world all the time, the player is a character in the town they're building, interacting with their fellow residents.\n\nThe best example of a game similar to what I'm imagining would be a Japanese PS2 game called [*Metropolismania*](https://youtu.be/K92p3W9ZNfM?t=1517). In it, you play as the mayor, and you design the city by walking around it and interacting with residents. Those residents tell you about what kind of amenities they wish were in town, and you ask other residents if they know anyone who might move in and start up a business to provide that service. \n\n**GAMEPLAY:** I imagine the game would start with the player choosing one of four scenarios:\n\n* **Mining:** You've found a rich deposit of a valuable mineral and staked your claim.\n* **Farming:** You've recently claimed a plot of land with some rich, fertile soil.\n* **Foresting:** You've found a forest of old growth trees that could be harvested for timber.\n* **Lodging:** You've found a good spot along a busy trade route where travellers might rest. \n\n**Objective 1:** You start by building up your mining/farming/forestry/lodging business. At first, the game is simply about building and managing this business (a la *Harvest Moon* or *Stardew Valley*). In the first three scenarios (mining, farming, forestry) some of your initial challenges involve transporting your harvested goods to market. In the lodging scenario, though, your challenge is attracting customers to stay at your inn.\n\n**Objective 2:** Once your business is built up, you'll need people to come work for you. So, your next challenge - once your business is off the ground - is to convince a few people to move nearby. This is where the city-building aspect starts, as you plan where in the town they should build their residences.\n\n**Objective 3:** After the first few people move in, they'll eventually want some nearby amenities - i.e. stores, restaurants, etc. So, your next challenge is to attract more residents to move in and start up businesses that provide these goods and services, plotting where they should go. (If your business is profitable enough and you've saved up enough cash, maybe you can even start these businesses yourself, but in either case you'll still need people to move in and work there.)\n\nFrom there, the rest of the game is about balancing and managing the needs of the town's residents, along with your own local business (or businesses). \n\n**FEATURES:** Ideally, I imagine there being a story-driven element to this progress. New residents might be fully-written characters, or maybe just have a random set of traits that help determine what amenities are most important to them, and how they spend their day. In either case, they give the player, as de facto mayor, a set of challenges or objectives for what they need done to remain happy and willing to stay. \n\nI also imagine a day-night cycle. Throughout the day, residents go to work and go home, stopping along the way to patronize other local businesses like a tavern or a shop. As the player character, you can choose how to spend your time, either working to improve your business, visiting residents, etc. \n\n**PLATFORM:** I think ideally this would probably end up being a PC game, but given that you're playing a character in the world it could probably work on consoles too?\n\n**CREDIT:** Hey, if you're an actual game designer reading this and you're interested, just go for it and make the game! But message me and let me know, because I'd love to play it and help anyway I could!"
acvmly,The Virtual Pet Ideal - A feasible and worthwhile way the idea can done.,"Free smartphone application.\n\nA fixed pool of 20~ or so characters, each with distinct physical features. (Breeding mechanic where these characters breed and create offspring with distinct looks based off of descended physical features (similar to Tamagotchi m!x series).)\n\nUpon loading you receive one egg. Upon hatching egg, you receive one creature, which is random. Cannot be reset or changed. You can only receive one through this.\n\n\nMeticulous AI with emotive reactions and consequence to every action and every combination of them. A range of raising, caring, and training features to be carried out be the player which use typical internal game mechanics as well as smartphone hardware features such as location, gyro etc. Eg. This may involve needing to take your creature for a walk, if you shake your phone your creature may become dizzy/excited/disturbed depending on its nature. There may be geographically-defined locations with interactive features, like that of Ingress, such as a virtual playground the pet can be taken to.\n\nTo avoid excessive notification spam, which could be an especial issue in a game like this, the game makes use of a single persistent and minimalist notification with all necessary information.\n\nThere is little/no internet functionality. The game is based on local interaction, community, and economy. Supports direct 'multiplayer' where players can let their creature's interact with each other, through such activities as raising/caring/training mechanics as well as breeding. There is also a 'StreetPass'-similar feature for more reserved players, where people with the app who physically pass within a certain distant can share content, such as satisfying creature social need.\n\nMain accessory is a 'Home'. Physically a ~7-inch square sub-HD touchscreen in a box, sold for under $50. Whereas the phone application primarily makes use of a creature habitat called a 'Pod', with more dynamic and mobile actives in mind, the 'Home' features, well, a home, and which supports larger, less limited, static activities.\n\nThe 'Home' is an always-on display and one of the appeals is that it will display the behaviour of the creature persistently, giving it a passive entertainment quality and making it more smoothly fit into the player's lifestyle. Intended way to play is to leave the creature in the home accessory when the player is home, and to bring the creature out when the player leaves. Can be done relatively seamless with Bluetooth. Has proprietary connections on the 5 other sides other than the screen, allowing multiple 'Home' units to be connected and therefore have creatures be able to seamlessly (interact similar to the 'Cube World' series of toys).\n\nGame has no microtransactions which makes it more broadly palatable and distinct. Monitised through accessories like the 'Home' (which is somewhat essential to get the full experience) and other enhancing accessories.\n\nThe game design is intentionally inconvenient to the player, and this is necessary to properly do the idea of a 'virtual pet' justice. Of course actual pets are a real responsibility, and that is part of the reason why it is especially rewarding with the fun parts of pet ownership. Tamagotchis in the early two-thousands and late nineties were controversial for the design that meant the pets could die if they were ignored for the day. This meant an actual perceived importance which is necessary for distinguishing this as a rewarding unique experience, and not a novelty which players will quickly bore of. It also made the product a household name for a spell.\n\nThe strict way in which the creatures can be obtained is also similar to this design philosophy. Everyone can receive one pet, but it it's not just up to your own discretion which one you end up getting. This means there is a more natural/incidental nature to the attachment and a draw for multiplayer interaction to obtain a different breed due to rarity.\n\nMost current 'virtual pet' applications are just throwaway novelties, because they are essentially self-contained mediocre games, with no broad reactivity or lifestyle integration and so players have little reason to keep playing once they bore of each activity.\n\n"

There's also a GIF in the replies that looks like a rabbit hurdle race game.  It oddly reminds me of the Game of Thrones opening, those handmade/clockwork models that grow out of the map.  Imagine a game where your character never leaves a 10'x10' room, only the floor/back wall/ceiling keep changing.  It would be kind of like an idea I'd swear I've seen before but can't place--a game that looks like an Ancient Greek play with moving set pieces rolled out onto the stage and things flying overhead on wires.\n\nI like the low-res 3D pixel art style.  It reminds me of the Grow series of games, like little animated dioramas.\n\nA related concept:  Maybe a game in which you're a prisoner playing a futuristic AR game inside your jail cell."
acsoia,A realistic fighting game,"Untrained fighters with rapidly depleting stamina, the potential to off balance themselves if they try too many moves (button bashers beware) and a momentum meter that reduces the efficacy of your block when you spike DPS.      \n\nSimply moves bordering on comedy mixed with fighters that require strategy and mild micromanagement to avoid being exploited, combo'd and cleaved.             \n\nCould have perks or variants like drunk (less damage taken, but worse balance) or ""I've had a few classes of MMA"" (more damage done, but less effective block due to over confidence)...         \n\nI know fighting games are tricky to make though, but I think this one has enough underlying things beyond ""fighting"" that even if one character becomes too ""meta"" they would be easily fixed by tweaking their balance loss during a combo or something.           \n\nOutside of this you could go crazy with the speeds regarding transition frames and effect on balance or stamina from moves depending on what they follow in the combo.

I have an idea that could take the br games to a new level, atleast I think.\nSo you got you're typical BR, players are dropped, looking for loot and forced to a center Point during the game, but why not creatie a 3th party treath? \nThis is a concept I've been playing with: you are a convict and have been given a change to win your freedom in a BR. But what you didn't know is that this is the perfect oppertunity for the goverment to test out there new experimental weapon. This can be different things. \n1. Creatures: multiple creatures are set lose on the island. There tough, fast and deadly. As player you do not want to encounter them, when you do, you are torn to pieces and other Players hear you scream. When a player enters the place of the massacre there is blood everywhere, the body is placed like a scène from Predator, so the player knows the creature is close and is going to need it's wit to evade it. They can be killed, but with effort or teamwork. \n2. The fog: A fog covers the island, those who breath it start to hallucinate, the land and other players start to you like they Came wright out of a nightmare. If you breath it to long, you go crazy and commit suïcide, so players need to find a gasmask, but the masks don't last forever.\n3. The collar: every player wears a collar, it activates and deactivates at random times. There are turrets in the map and drones in the sky. When your collar activates they target you. So players need to be carefull and watch for save spots when they collar activates. \n4. The labyrinth: Instead of Being on an Island, players are in a 3d maze, that keeps changing.\nThe creature van be used in this mode.\nThe match Starts as a regular BR game. At some Point players hear a fog Horn or something that that Starts one of these scenarios or not. Players never know what's going to happen if something is going to happen. \nThe thing is I like games that are always different when you play them, games with a Big randomness factor, so you don't get bored of them soon and it keeps you on Edge. I love the br games but there's so much more you can do with it."

acf9w2,"A MOBA game where you control a group of soldiers, instead of a single champion. More soldiers will be added overtime, so the more battles you win, the better your soldiers and the greater their number. There are different kinds of soldiers, and the goal is to acquire capture points","The soldiers include Support Troopers, Assault Troopers, Artillery Troopers, Armored Troopers, Scout Troopers, Shock Troopers. Players must determine the optimum combination of troopers for specific situations, such as attack, defense, capture, hold, and trap setting. The player can request that the newer soldiers can be any one of the selections. The goal is to win capture points, to the point that the opposing side has no more resources to counter, and cannot reverse their losses. Different maps require different strategy, as level grounds are different fighting environment than valleys, mountains, hills, and forests. \n\nEach team of eighteen players will each control an army, and they can decide which player goes to what role, so one person can be in charge of attack plans, another in charge of defense plans, one in charge of reinforcements, etc. If one player is AFK, another player can be allowed to temporarily take control of his units, until that player returns. The game is played till one side surrenders, or a goal is reached (for example, after capturing 20 points, or holding a position for certain amount of time, etc.). Soldiers that win battles gain experience levels, which gives them better stats, such as firepower, armor, movement, or abilities, such as invisibility, digging-in, leaping over terrains, or building watch towers, calling in aerial bombardments, etc.  Players can also work together against an AI, called Swarm, where they have to destroy an enemy base, or as a survival mode"

They'd debate where to put that ""sexy bitch"" (i.e. the trophy) within their starship.\n\nGame Name: *T And T*\n\nLogline: The HIGHEST octane FPS is recent memory, looking to be a better game of its kind than *Duke Nukem Forever* (which I hear was a huge flop).\n\nTagline: Gaming's next iconic duo. We bet.\n\nStory: This game follows bounty hunters Trevor and Turam, otherwise known as the eponymous  player characters *T And T.* They are the Milky Way's deadliest duo, and even have their own commercials advertising their ass-kicking services to the darker parts of the universal map (since it's illegal on planets like Earth). Trevor is an Earth Marine veteran, while Turam is a hulking space alien vet who served in the Terra-Chi'Lum War (in which Humanity nearly lost but was aided by Turam's people the Ulkoans). They are the best of bros, and are given the assignment of a lifetime come the second cutscene: Reach a piece of technology from Andromeda before the bad guys do, and blow it up. \n\nGameplay: Campaign mode sees the player taking turns as Trevor and Turam with each level. Each of the dudes has their own abilities, and species-special weapons. The game has the real benefits if you choose to play on the two highest Difficulties, which are called Bullpoint and Mess. Gonna break down the gameplay in other parts of this, since Campaign just seems like I'd be talking more about the story...\n\nThe catch of *T And T* is that, unlike most FPS's, it has fun, diverse SINGLE player modes where you won't get easily overrun by enemies after twenty minutes or killed in one shot. Other FPS's are online-geared and emphasize multiplayer as keys of why people by them. There's humorous dialogue from Trevor and Turam as you play as them in side modes such as Hitting Ducks. Latter mentioned is where you get a kill job but it's ONLY on Mess difficulty, but you can still go to settings to choose infantry and even what gear your character has on, some of which gives extra health. As stated before, completing the story has a lot of benefits.\n\nAnother mode (which would ideally be DLC) is Ebonblood, a half-story half-misc. mode where you fight new enemies who are genetically enhanced space pirates called the Type-Blacks. They are competing rivals of the Genohood from Campaign, and spew black blood and gore when you defeat them. \n\nAny thoughts? I might actually go to an intensive where I live that teaches 3D animation. Here's hoping I can put some digital shit of Trevor and Turam on my flash. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;"
acc1bn,Perhaps a mafia style game with some crusader kings 2 mechanics?,"(Sorry for any crappy grammar btw)\n\nJust came up with this idea today while watching some game dev videos on youtube. No idea if this already exist but how about a game where you take control of a certain character (randomly generated or created by you) who is a in charge or simply apart of a generated mafia family.  The goal is to make money, grab new territory, wipe out other families and to go as long as possible without having your own family destroyed. \n\nI have a few other ideas but I just wanted to see if you folks think that this is an interesting idea or not.

acb7yu,Universe: X9,"The game is an open world type of game where you travel to various planets. It  is a FPS. \n\nThe main story concerns you finding pieces of X9, a powerful weapon used to destroy the spaceships of an evil alien species that will invade the universe soon.. \n\n\n--- You can build and customize your own spaceships, and even guns.\n\n\n---- Each planet is unique. They have different weather and(the inhabited ones) alien civilizations in various stages of evolution. \n\nOn certain planets you can find civilizations like we had on Middle Age with castles, kings, etc. \n\nBut they are different, small architectural differences you would not find on Earth, they worship different beings, etc..\n\n------ You can visit planets that are unrelated to the main quest. Think Skyrim in space. There is a ton of side quests and other storylines..\n\n---- If you are rich enough, you can even buy(and name) your own planet. You decide who lives there. You can hire troops to guard it while away. \n\nDepending on the planet, some alien species might invade looking to plunder its resources.\n\n----- There are multiple types of currencies in game and each civilization uses its own. You have to keep an eye on them\n\n---- New quests can be constantly released and integrated within the game(even if at first were not present). \n\nNew main stories, new villains, even new items. Even new planets. All these can be structured in expansion packs or dlc. Can be free or sold to players separately.\n\n------ A level editor to make your own planets and quests that can be shared between players in future online communities. It should be an easy to use tool(not like some editors we see). \n\n\n"

ac32bx,A ritual kinda horror-storyline game,"**Storyline and Gameplay:**\n\nA guy or a kid who is a fan of rituals and paranormal stuff chanced upon this ritual titled The Midnight Game. (More details of it here [https://theghostinmymachine.com/2014/03/31/the-most-dangerous-games-the-midnight-game/](https://theghostinmymachine.com/2014/03/31/the-most-dangerous-games-the-midnight-game/)) One night his parents left home for a business trip, and he found himself a great opportunity to conduct this ritual with his group of friends. \n\nFirst part of gameplay can be locating the necessary items for the rituals, to build up the atmosphere. Because the midnight man has to begin at midnight, the player has all time from the start of the game till midnight to find the items. Once completed the time will move straight to 12 midnight. And player begins the ritual (Can be in a form of a cutscene)\n\nMidnight man is summoned. Players need to keep moving about in the house with his group of friends, each holding on to a candle. If either one of the candles is extinguished, it means the Midnight Man is near and the player has to either relight the extinguished flame within 10 secs or quickly surround the person with the extinguished candle in a circle of salt. If the former is done, the game continues to 3.33am. If the latter is done, the person in the circle has to sit there till 3.33am. (Which is not ideal for a game, so you could think of ways to improvise this. For example, having the friend disappear. You can then improvise this on the later part of the storyline) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**How to make the midnight man:**\n\nThe Midnight Man can be coded like Slender man (There are some similar source codes to Slender man AI, I know because i have successfully coded it on Unity) , where it teleports around the house but gradually go closer and closer to the players and his group of friends, with the indicator being the candle light they are holding. You can also tweak the gameplay such that players have to search for somethings while walking around the house, just like the notes in Slenderman.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo anyways that the major and pretty short part of the gameplay, but to make this game a more fulfilling one, we can continue the story, assuming the player finishes and survives till 3.33am.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Some details for the gameplay too:**\n\nPlayers have the option of having a digital watch and setting the alarm at 3.33am which it will ring and signal the end of the game for the player.\n\nOR\n\nHaving working and coded clocks around the house which helps the player tell the time.\n\n(The latter is preferred, especially if you would like to continue the storyline)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**If you want to continue the storyline to prolong the game:**\n\nPlayer and his friends, seeing that the time struck 3.33am, extinguished their candles and switch out to their flashlights. Those in the salt circles stood up and left the circle, thinking that they had survived. The next morning, (Even the one that disappeared if you improvised the above that way) found each other alive and well. (Not knowing that those who disappeared are actually already dead and the Midnight Man has tricked them via illusions) and the friends pretty much left the house. The player cleans up the house and found something wrong. All the clocks in house stopped at 3am. Player knew something was wrong and summoned his friends again that night and they began to think that they were tricked by the Midnight Man and they had actually lost the game. The solution they found online was to re-summon the Midnight Man again, and this time kill it for good. (How to kill it, it is up to developer to decide, like you can say use a knife that is washed in holy water, whichever, this will help build up the story towards the end). So again, you gather candles, however, this time, no salt because you want it to appear.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSummon the Midnight man and all of a sudden, all the candles extinguished together, leaving the player in complete darkness, but player is able to relight his own candle, to find that all his friends were missing. So player then moves around the house with his candle to find his friends. (Jump scares come in) as the midnight man then appears. Note that at this point in time, it is the first time player sees the Midnight Man, so if he is freaking scary, then the effect is only going to be... freaking scary. (He can be standing in some corner too, it's fine, just find a way to scare your players) Anyways, player must be then able to fight the midnight man with his equipped weapon. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**How to fight the Midnight Man and how to link it to the story:**\n\nFirst, depending on the number of friends that was with the player, if the midnight man was successfully dealt damage, it will disappear and be at a new part of the game map, which player must locate again. The midnight man is only killed if the number of successfully dealt damage equals to that of the number of friends. (By the term successfully, it can be up to developer, like maybe when it reaches a certain threshold on the Midnight Man's health)\n\nNow linking it back to the story:\n\nThe Midnight Man was killed. Or so the player thought. After the Midnight Man ""dies"", the light in the entire house light up. And all the player sees, are the dead bodies of his friends, all slashed up and killed by the player himself. The front door opens, and the player's parents screams can be heard.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe end.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome notes:\n\nI have actually done bits of it - Not as a 3D game, but an ambitious pixel art 2D platformer game. But i doubt i can finish the game proper as pixel art 2D platformer game on an idea like this is a fairly difficult task for me at the very least! So I shall provide this idea for any promising developer to adopt! If you are keen to know more, or even want to work with me on such a project, just let me know! Thanks!"
ac1vj5,"A 4-Player Co-op game about Scooby-doo style group of kids. Scavenging weapons, investigating, and killing Occult monsters.","I’m very aware the Blackout Club is coming out. But, I feel like that has very different tones and mechanics. So I’ve decided to make my own concept for this type of game.\n\nSummary: Welcome to Woodbury Square. The heart of the American dream. With a thriving and happy community. But, one day, that all changes. Strange symbols are appearing around the town, people have gone missing, and very peculiar animals are showing up around town. But things don’t really get crazy until a new face, Dr. Soldat, shows up in town. A master of all things occult. He recruits a skilled group of local students to hunt down these terrors and the greater threats. Armed with only their wits and guided by a consistently-wasted leader. They face terrors man-made and supernatural. And will soon have the whole world looking for assistance from those “Meddling Kids” (tittle). \n\nGameplay: The game is a mix of Hitman and Resident Evil. The kids gather information throughout the day. Talking, sneaking around, and other dubious tasks to find their objective. All while avoiding the police. If they can’t find it by nightfall. They need to hunker down and stand against the hordes of monsters after them. But only have a maximum of five days to find what they’re looking for. If it’s found, they’ll have find a way to defeat terrifying beasts. \n\nExample Mission: A wealthy cheerleader has gone missing. Leaving only the ruined remains of her home. You decide to start your search for answers at her home. Which, hours later, is still being poked around with by a cop. You make a phone call to lure him away. Choosing the right options to make the operator direct him away from the house. Inside, you find evidence that her parents were deeply involved with a club of strange people. Who operate out of a country club on the edge of town. You wait till the club goes empty before breaking into the main office. Discovering the name of the club’s members. Who are using fake names, but Soldat checks if it’s been used elsewhere. Discovering a trailer rented on the edge of town under the same fake name and info. You break into the trailer park and investigate. Where you find the group is a part of a much bigger Cult. Which believes that a worthy girl of seventeen must lose her life to summon a dark beast. Cult members quickly rush to the van in an attempt to stop you. You can’t call the cops. So you must try to find the keys and drive away, Hotwire the car (if you have that skill), make an all-out dash, sneak away, or brawl with them. Giving you the location of where the meeting will be held.\n\nExample Raid: You have everything you need. Now it’s time to get in and save the girl. You arm yourselves with makeshift weapons crafted with collected scraps. Putting together weapons and tools that can be used to save her. Such as a Spiked baseball bat, Slingshot, A flash camera, and a drone. You break in and unlock a puzzle to unlock the underground ritual area. Getting past traps, and beating on guards. You have one last fight with the supernatural terror the cult is trying to summon. Saving the girl. You may choose to either take everything to the police, or have one last fight with her parents for extra rewards. \n\nAftermath: The club posts their investigation online (taking care not to reveal their identity). Exposing everyone involved in the small cult. While they intentionally choose to leave the occult monster out. There’s more than enough evidence and outcry for the police to arrest the parents. Soldat takes liberties with the Cult’s cash. Handing it out to the members, and expanding their supernatural hunt. "
abye3i,A Survival game placed in a bahama like enviroment,The Game could be like an ark survival evolved style game where u start of on a random island maybe 50 islands on the server with 25 players on a server aswell as npc islands that u could eventually raid but essentially u would start with a small sloop style boat and move up to larger shils like man o wars etc and everything on the ship has to be manually placed like beter cannons beter crew etc crew couls have a slave like system where u could either recruit men through combat or hiring them at the npc islands every player can conquer a single island where no one else could build but u can still get raided and for base building u could add a fort style building method.\n\nJust got the idea after wayching black sails sorry if its a bit big but maybe it gets seen😝
abwyra,Giant robot game played as a tiny human,"I love giant robots, but I enjoy playing as a tiny human even more.  It boggles my mind that there hasn't been a Mechwarrior game where you can get out of the mech.  A game based on the pen and paper Mechwarrior RPG could be amazing.\n\nMy ideal version of this would be something like Fallout 3 meets Shadows of the Colossus, but it could be done with simple pixel art or even a minimal roguelike interface.  Roguelike would probably be best for simulating an open world MMO.  You could play as an engineer, pilot, infantry soldier, any class you want.  The key feature of the game would be those giant battle mechs, which only skilled pilots can operate.\n\nI can think of only two games I've played that touched on this concept:\n\nBattleTech: The Crescent Hawk's Inception\n\n[https://www.mobygames.com/game/amiga/battletech-the-crescent-hawks-inception](https://www.mobygames.com/game/amiga/battletech-the-crescent-hawks-inception)\n\nMetal Warriors\n\n[https://nfgworld.com/rediscovering-metal-warriors/](https://nfgworld.com/rediscovering-metal-warriors/)\n\nOthers on Reddit have mentioned MechAssault 2 and Titanfall let you exit the mech on some missions, and Lost Planet has mechs.\n\nFor copyright reasons, I'd develop a semi-original (i.e., not BattleTech) world inspired by tokusatsu shows and movies.  The Earth Defense Force series is a good example of playing as a tiny human in battles with giant enemies.  Imagine kaiju-scale destructible terrain--skyscrapers collapsing and giant radio antennae used as weapons.  But maybe that's getting out of hand.  Low-res graphic with as much detail and depth as possible is the way to go."
abwmsm,Father,"Hello Everyone! I am currently creating a game, and thought about posting here. Feedback is well appreciated! ;)\n\n\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\n\nMain Concept:\n\nA game about loss, grief, life and memories, disease and death. You are a father, have a wife and a kid, and a day you get a disease which puts you in coma. It's here the gameplay starts. You ""spawn"" in a small world/city, and you need to protect the city from the ""disease"" monsters, who slowly will try to eat away the city into void as the city is surrounded by a black void. Ultimately you will maybe not be able to keep up, as the monsters will spawn more frequently and with more and harder monsters.  At the endgame only the heart of the city is left, and you get to accept your death. In the meantime you can communicate with you family through the heart of the city.\n\n\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\n\nThis game will mostly focus on the story, and the gameplay focuses on collecting memories, fighting monsters, and talking to your family. When talking to the outside world, you can only get a lamp to light red or green. I have not decided  how to limit talking to the outside, but I think you need to use collected memories as a currency for such. The game will start slow, but pick up pace as time goes as you need to fight the monsters and collect memories at a faster paste to keep the monsters in check.\n\n\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\n\nThe Monsters:\n\nThe monsters is obviously a symbol for the disease, as the city is for yourself and your body. \n\n* Eater: Simple enemies found earlier in the game. A blob of goo. No special attack but will eat the terrain.\n* Voidwalkers: Identical to eaters, except with legs, and arms. Walking speed would be about 1.5 times an eater. No special attack.\n* Shader: Humanoid figures found from 1/4 of the game throughout, and they have just 2 white eyes. The Humanoids attacks citizins and you. Their walking speed is slower than the player.\n\n\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\n\nThe Story:\n\nThe story will start of as you choosing how you live your life. You get to name yourself, get to choose where to go to eventually meet your wife, choose your childs name and so on. You will start to fell something is wrong, thinking about going to the doctors, but refuse. (that you can't frustrantingly not choose to do). When you finally collapse you get rushed to the hospital and gets into coma. I haven't thought that much about the rest, just that the father and child have a strong bond, and talked maybe about a land between life and death. Just in the end an emotional story.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\n\nWell that was the most of it. I haven't come up with a fighting system yet, but if you guys have an idea it's welcome ;).\n\nI am making the most myself, including music and coding, but need a guy to do the artwork. Oh, btw it's a 2d top down game, with prite 64x64. If interested, dm me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks if you read it all, feedback is welcome :) Have a nice day"

abgjux,Plot Idea: Amber and the Attack of the Company,"**Story**\n\nAmber Owens is a 13-year-old girl living with her parents on Planet Misteen. One fine morning, a mysterious spaceship belonging to the Kalovan Works Company (KWC) connects itself to the planet and begins mechanising it. The military of the nations of Misteen attack with everything at their disposal, but their weapons are no match for the KWC's advanced technology. During the attack on her hometown, Amber's parents are killed and she is left an orphan. After the dust clears, Amber sees that her parents are dead, and vows revenge against the KWC. She finds a weapon of the player's choosing and sets out.\n\nAfter Amber defeats Mecha-Maple in Resolution River and the Holographic Defense System in OS Ocean, Amber enters the third world, Bitmap Bay. Here, Amber first encounters Julia, the secretary of the KWC. Julia tells Amber that their Misteen Mechanisation Project is already underway, and she will not have a native interfere with the KWC's plans. However, Julia's mech suit proves unable to defeat Amber, forcing her to flee.\n\nAmber then defeats the 8-Bit Heavies in Overlord Outlet and encounters Julia again in Terabyte Tropics. Julia tells Amber that she has improved since the first battle and that she will not give an inch of ground. However, Amber, making use of an HWC mech she hijacked, is able to destroy the battery of Julia's mech, defeating her.\n\nAmber next journeys to Internet Island and defeats the Internet Virus Guard there. Amber finds a hidden control panel for the mysterious HWC spaceship, the Central Core, and manages to use it to get in. The road through the Central Core is long and arduous, but eventually, Amber is able to make it to the head office of the company. When she gets there, she encounters Julia yet again. The two clash once more, and Julia is defeated. It is at this point that Amber notices a mysterious device attached to Julia's chest.  Checking the model of the machine, she finds it to be a hypnosis device, and Amber smashes the machine, freeing Julia from the KWC's control. At this point, the president of the KWC, the robotic President Gigarobo, reveals himself.\n\nGigarobo explains that he is mechanising Misteen to use as his base to conquer and mechanise the universe, but he cannot do so if Amber keeps trashing his machines. Amber retorts back that she will always fight for the Misteen that she knew, not this Misteen. Amber then engages Gigarobo, and the final battle commences. The final battle is hard and exhausting, but finally Amber is able to expose Gigarobo's core and rip it out, destroying Gigarobo and ending the KWC's threat. At this point, Julia comes to her senses and thanks Amber for saving her from the abusive Gigarobo. She then activates the Central Core's self-destruct mechanism, and she and Amber are able to escape the Central Core seconds before it explodes.\n\nThe ending will change whether Amber has collected the 100 De-Mech Stars scattered throughout the levels. If Amber has not collected them all, Misteen will remain mechanised and Amber will lament on the cold status of her home. If she has collected all 100, they will react above her head to free Planet Misteen of its mechanisation. As Julia flies off into space, Amber vows to keep Misteen safe from any further harm."
afaw2u,I need help with my game,"I’ve been developing on a game akin to Dead By Daylight. I am a fan of both DBD and Friday the 13th, but due to F13 being dead, I’ve decided to reinvent it. Imagine if DBD met F13. I’ve tried to make my game like that. However, I’ve got everything sussed our (killers, maps, explorers (my version of survivors). Apart from one thing. You can escape in a variety of different ways: repairing a car, repairing a phone box, (think red England one) finding moneys and a phonebook, and calling the SCP Team, which either appear as vans at one of the exits or a helicopter with ladder in a random space on the map. You can also escape in the elevator, similar to the DBD hatch. It’s opened by installing a fuse into a fuse box. However, I feel like the elevator escape doesnt fit with the car and SCP Team Escape. Do you have any other potential escape ideas?"
af8jqm,Nations And Kingdoms (NaK),"**Lore Wise:** The game takes place in a fantasy world With many Different nations and kingdoms. first of all, there will be basic kingdoms that will start on game launch and then kingdoms and nations would start developing from players that had the most impact on the game. when time comes an element stone will appear and the players would choose which player would posses this ""Element stone"". the player who won the ""Element stone"" would plant it in a object called ""stone of creation"" that would growing a kingdom that has the special features according to the element stone.. for example:Dark element stone would start growing a dark empire .the player who were granted the stone would be promoted to a king and would lead people who follow his kingdom. there will be many different element stones that are only usable once to build the MAIN kingdom and other minor elemental stone for conquest. at the start of the game you will be a ""Lone Wolf"" wandering across the kingdoms and you can choose anytime for which kingdom you would like to join or keep being a ""Lone Wolf"". being in a part of a nation grants you perks to your combat according to the kingdom you chose and as the game progresses the element power you posses from your kingdom gets more powerful.  \n\n\n**Combat:** The combat would be fast action . as your skills gets stronger it would be seen in a visual way (more destructive ,size ,power) and effect.   \n**NOW IT GETS INTERESTING: each time you reach a certain point in progression of your skills you could choose from MANY different options what to add to your skills (visually , effects, damage types, weapon enchantment) and it would have no limit to how many times you add something to your skills but as you progress it would be much harder to progress your skills further more(like leveling in BDO) so in that way you'll never get bored from using the same skills over and over and your skills would never look the same like other players have so each player would have a unique set of skills.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Equipment:** as for equipment it will be much different then wearing armor because instead of armor you will absorb a magical stone that boosts your stats changes you visually (you can choose that it wont change you visually if you dont want to) and adds more depth to you abilities and skills.  \n\n\n**PVE:** even tho the idea is heavily based in Nations/Kingdoms vs Nations/Kingdoms PVP ... there would be huge events for pve that might require alliances . slaying the PVE threats would grant a resources Magical armor stones and maybe some cosmetics that would look like a trophy of defeating the boss.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**PVP:  the pvp would revolve around a competitive friendly / conquest / practice friendly and etc.**   \nfor pvp in the MAIN kingdoms would be built a large Colosseum arena that visually will look like its kingdom style .  \nthere will be different types of arena Colosseum  :  \ncompetitive arena: where players will show their power in field against one another and rank up  \nNormal arena: where you can practice combat\n\nchallenge arena: arena with unique objectives that are required to fulfill in order to win.  \n\n\nKingdom Championship arena: where everybody can join the spectators seat and see who wins  the title as the strongest\n\nplayer in the kingdom.  \n\n\nhow pvp would look like: because the tremendous amount of different skills and abillities the player would need to learn his opponent abilities while fighting . so the battles would look very unique and interesting to watch .  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;"
af62te,An open world moba inspired battle royal game with a focus on story and characters.,
af61th,Shoot em up maybe idk,"A game that is made as one single level that continues to zoom in, i think this could be interesting as maybe a shoot em up or a puzzle game and i feel the graphical way to approach this would to literally paint picture from small to big. The change in gameplay from when the player begins to progress through the level and the geometry of the level becomes more simplistic as the detail is taken away by the zooming in \n\nIt would be up to a developer to think of the rest of the game how they shrink whether it has something to do with the amount of enemies left on the level eg 100 enemies equals 100% size or if they go into some sort of zone or solve some puzzle to shrink down.\n\nI think another approach to this game could be a 3d game that takes place on a single cube by zooming in and rotating around the cube. The objectives could be as simple as influencing the colour of a face which involves zooming in on a sort of planetary scale to reveal hidden detail under or on the surface of a cube.\n\nAny suggestions please add them in the comments"

af53nk,🌽 An idea for a Children of the Corn stealth/survival horror game 💀,"**I’d LOVE a quality psychological horror experience that makes engaging the kids genuinely scary (almost a Rule of Rose vibe) while building dread &amp; intrigue behind the cult. Apologies for the length, feedback is welcome:** 👍  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Setting:** Loosely adapting Stephen King's 1977 short story of the same name, most of the game takes place in the fictional town of Gatlin, Nebraska, a once average rural community long since largely forgotten by the passage of time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlthough the occasional soul still passes by on the road, typically from or on the way to Grand Island (70 miles away), the area has accumulated a reputation as something of a ""ghost town"" after a string of disappearances dating back to 1964.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese are dismissed or rationalized by most folks as tall tales, exaggerations, cold cases, or news stories people get the location of wrong. Nevertheless, nobody seems to have positive proof of anyone visiting Gatlin and returning.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRumors range from it being haunted to having been occupied by wild animals, serving as refuge for violent/territorial homeless &amp; drug addicts, hiding a family of cannibals, and other popular additions to Nebraska's urban legends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou play as one of a couple on a cross-country vacation to California (hoping to save your marriage) until accidentally hitting a boy on the road. Upon stopping, you see that his throat was slit. He was already dying while fleeing something.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Plot:** It follows much of the original story, except you investigate &amp; solve the mystery of Gatlin at your own pace (if you choose) without exposition spoon-fed to you. You’d start by choosing to play the man or woman and name yourself. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSimilarly to **Fallout 4**, dialogue could be voiced and your spouse would address you in the name you choose (provided it makes sense and fits with the many pre-recorded names, or he/she would simply refer to you as ""dear, honey"", etc).  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou move the boy to the side of the road, debating with your spouse whether to take his body to Gatlin or Grand Island. Examining the damaged car, you insist on finding the closest mechanic until your ride conks out shortly outside town.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith little choice but to leave your car to walk the rest of the way, you request your spouse stay with the vehicle since it has your things in back + the body in the trunk in case someone comes, before entering town for help (a phone, gas).  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou don’t see any kids for the first hour or so but discern from dilapidated environments, missing adults, old calendars, and signs of bloodshed that something’s wrong. Exploring reveals notes, drawings, odd improvised religious displays.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSearching deeper uncovers adults' rotted corpses + a couple-few docile kids in hiding. Much like **Silent Hill**, the amount of effort you make determines how much lore you earn. The cult initially stalks you, only making noises &amp; disappearing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne divergence from the short story is that this version of the cult had a brief ""civil war"" years ago (some kids left with nasty scars), leading to a few defectors trying &amp; failing to flee or hiding. Hence, the rare docile children you meet.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen the danger begins, you return to the car only to find your spouse missing and the tires slashed. At this point, the game fully opens up. You decide how it ends: **A)** Find parts around town to repair your vehicle and escape Gatlin alone. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**B)** Locate your spouse before he/she is killed. Like the **Deadrising** series, there's a deadline to this. If you take too many days, you'll find him/her crucified as described in the story before ""He Who Walks Behind the Rows"" traps &amp; kills you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**C)** Collect clues on “He Who Walks Behind the Rows” to learn a banishment ritual. Defeat it by following the instructions, which involve setting fire to the cornfield, and escape in the chaos alone or with your beloved + the few innocent kids.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis experience brings you closer and you later adopt the kids. **D)** Upon confronting ""He Who Walks Behind the Rows"" at the ritual, sacrifice yourself instead so your spouse can escape with the kids. He/she takes care of them, grieving you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**E)** Drive as far as you can in the opposite direction to Grand Island with the body, assisted by a passing stranger along the way, and avoid Gatlin altogether. You're arrested/investigated but ultimately let go, divorcing months afterward.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gameplay:** Somewhat like **The Evil Within**'s early chapters, the kids can quickly overwhelm you in numbers if alerted. You can sneak around them or stealth-kill them one by one. When better armed, you can fight off small groups.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile the concept of killing children is definitely controversial even for an M-rated game, their designs here would differ from the Amish-clothed descriptions in King's story. Many would appear dirtier, bloody, clothes messy, hair unkempt.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few of the older teens, who've fought more and accumulated more scars, would look almost inhuman. Only the more elite kids with the most authority in the cult would have cleaner clothes &amp; hair but none would appear fully normal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHiding or laying traps can be equally effective. Your actions will have consequences though. Patrols will frequent areas where you’ve been detected repeatedly. The tougher teens (with better loot) also eventually replace foes you kill.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTools &amp; resources can be looted off kids or around town. Weapons break and/or wear over time. Guns &amp; ammo are VERY scarce. There's no upgrading or skill tree. With enough supplies, you can fortify a room in one of several buildings.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis acts as a safe-house until you move supplies elsewhere. The rare nice kids will also shelter you in small hidden spots. Wander too far outside town into the cornfields or woods, however, and “He Who Walks Behind the Rows” emerges. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne hit from this entity is fatal. You can't kill or hide from it but can slow it down with fire or outrun it if you pace your stamina. Lastly, a day/night cycle and dynamic weather influence how easily the children see you, especially outside.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEx- You're more likely to be spotted under a clear sun, cloudy day, or moonlit night than in mist or a heavy rainstorm. This affects your health too, as you'll need to maintain temperature in addition to food, water, and avoiding infection.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**So, that's everything I've got for how I imagined this in my head. I sincerely apologize again for the long length** 🙏 **but hope this will encourage discussion. Feel free to offer thoughts, suggestions, and/or criticisms!** 🤷"
af36aq,Demonic AR,"So had this game idea back when I first started hearing about augmented reality games. I think it was back when Microsoft first showed off some glasses with the idea of turning your living room into an interactive game. \n\nThe idea is basically to survive a bunch of demons trying to scare or lure you outside of a protective circle to your demise. The AR comes in by having you map out your room first for basic structures like furniture and doorways, fire places, etc. You then lay out a phyicsl circle, maybe on a mat or large paper for ease of cleaning later.  Now you turn down lights so that it is dim and sit or stand in the middle. \n\nGame starts with maybe some lightning effects, spooky sound, etc  to set an atmosphere. Slowly little monsters start to appear from behind things, out of shadows, and so on. Eventually bigger monsters, jump scare type encounters, and so on try to lure you out of the circle. Maybe throw in some fake doorbell sounds or door knocking out phone call rings to trick the player. \n\nCould also add in some digital candles around the circle you must protect from being extinguished to add another element?"

aeryyo,A multiplayer game but with ghosts?,"I’ve been dreaming about a game where, if you die, you get turned into a ghost. When a ghost, you can talk to living humans close by. You can either possess your corpse while it still has a little bit of life force, you can possess another person’s corpse, giving you their loadout and class, or you can resurrect someone else on your team while they’re ghost is still remaining and they can live and you get to choose a different loadout.\n\nGhosts can identify who’s ghost is alive by a blue aura surrounding their corpse and ghosts can see other ghosts. Here’s the control mapping I was thinking of for ghosts;\n\nXbox:\n\nX for Possess,\nB for Resurrection,\nY to just quit (respawn)\nA is jump\n\nPS4:\n\n ⏹ is for Possess\n ⏺ is for Resurrection \n 🔼 to just quit (respawn)\n ✖️ is jump\n\nKeyboard:\n\nC for Possess \nQ is for Resurrection\nR to just quit (respawn)\n[SPACE] to jump\n\n\n\n\nWhen possessing someone’s corpse you have the same name, but everything about you is different. I realize this might be a problem with bodies piling on the floor, which I think that corpses that have no life force should just be discarded/despawned. “What if their ghost has already possessed someone?” Well you can still\npossess them as long as you hurry, every minute that a corpse’s ghost has possessed something then the corpse despawns. “What if someone takes my corpse but I wanted to possess it?” Then just quit and play with the same class as last time. “But what if I resurrect someone who is possessing something?” You can’t. Simple as that.\n\nI think I have covered every problem, but if you think of problems that might happen just say so and I’ll possibly reply with a solution.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

(They can not actually steal)\n\nThe round runs on a timer until the store shuts down, if you do not leave before the timer runs out, you are kicked out and all points are lost. This does not apply for officers.\n\nWhen caught, you loose all your points and get kicked out.\n\nWhen kicked out, you go into spectator mode where you can watch the whole game go on through security cameras."

ae6mj9,The Four Horsemen,"I haven’t thought this idea through to much yet but I wanted to write it down quickly before I forget.\n\nEssentially it’s a very cinematic linear game in a mix of the style of God of War and Uncharted. It follows the Biblical Apocalypse  depicted in the book of Revelations, and you get to play as one of the four horsemen of the apocalypse. Pseudo RPG sort of gameplay, with a skill tree and small scale gear system but not too much grind. Each horseman would have a different playstyle, pestilence would be a poison/ ranger type class, war would be the typica warrior class, famine is harder to imagine but I think it would involve drastically weakening enemies with rebuffs, and finally, death would be a necromancer/ mage. Story I’m pretty undecided on, there’s a lot developers do as the bible doesnt go into too much detail on the events of the apocalypse. The story should be gritty and it would be cool to give each horseman memorable characters. In terms of gameplay, it can be 1 player or coop, and when you’re playing alone, the other three horsemen could be NPC’s similar to Atreus in God of War or the Side Characters in Uncharted. \n\nAnyway, that’s just some ideas I had for a game I’d love to see one day.\n\nAny thoughts would be appreciated :)"
ae4dxc,"A 4-player party game about trying to beat your friends to the punch for powerups, often with disastrous results.","Players control animals in other animal costumes (e.g. a chicken in a cow costume) through a gauntlet of quirky mini-games to get the highest score. However, the core gimmick of the game is its ""Quick Draw"" events:\n\nEvery so often the current mini-game will pause and, after a short countdown, a random powerup will flash on-screen. The first player to press a button on their controller will steal and keep that powerfup for the remainder of the entire round.\n\n**The catch is:** Almost half of those powerups are *gag* powerups that make things worse. They're wacky debuffs. For example, one might set you on fire so now you're a little bit faster but you also can't stop moving. Like... ever. The result is that players become torn between wanting to be quickest at nabbing a powerup and wanting to carefully consider the powerup they'd be stealing.\n\n****\n\nThat was only one kind of Quick Draw event. There are more.\n\nAnother Quick Draw event displays four powerups in order *before* the countdown timer starts. Once able, the first person to press a button gets the first powerup, the second to press gets the second powerup, and so-on. Depending on the powerups and their order, you might want to be the first to press your button but would hate to be a split second to late and end up with the second. If nobody is pressing buttons, either fake sounds will play to trick players into pressing or the items will reshuffle without warning.\n\nHalf of the fun is players doing otherwise straightforward mini-games while dealing with a nonstop stacking buffs and debuffs. You might have earned yourself a ""sticky"" powerup that prevented you from sliding/skidding during the Thin Ice Tricycle Race, but now it's making you slower during the Potato Sack Slide... and now you got the dreaded ""hiccup"" buff that presses a random input on your controller at the worst times (even during Quick Draws)."

adrevx,Why you should write a Game Design Document for your project,
adqqwg,A Read Dead/Rockstar style game featuring an agent of the British Empire as the main character.,"This could be set around the same time as the RDR series, in the late 19th or first decade of the 20th century. It could feature the protagonist traveling to different parts of the world and participating in various conflicts of the time, such as the great game, Indian uprisings, the Beor wars, the arms/naval race against the German empire, etc. \n\nIf this sub is more geared for practical game concepts, and not the “this style game in this setting” format of this post, I apologize. Just wanted to see if anyone would want to spitball off this as a Red Dead fan or as someone interested in the time period. \n\n\n"
adpteh,The game of life.,"A VR game where you wake up and go to your 9-5 office desk job.  Return home to eat dinner with your wife and two smart-ass kids.  After 3 minutes of sitting in awkward silence, everyone at the table starts yelling at each other in the language that the sims use.  After the fight is over you clean up and go to sleep on the couch and do the same thing the next day.  Before you go to work every morning you have the option to drive your car off a bridge.  The goal is to survive as many rounds as you possibly can.    \n\n\nThe game will succeed since its VR and sounds like fun to a child.    \n\n\nA later prequel where you play as a younger version of the main character in the first game.  In this, you attend high school, goof off, vape and do homework all whilst you have visions of your parents fighting and there are ambient sounds of parents yelling at each other. "
adlfo0,Rpg. Co-op multiplayer 2-4 players,"I dont know if this is the correct sub, but i was talking to my brother about games like runescape, fallout and skyrim and such. And we came up with the idea that a rpg with the possibility to play co-operative/split screen would be amazing. Imagine doing a skyrim run with 4 players at once. I cannot think of a game that has this exact feature. If you do let me know! Thanks for reading :)"
adl5jh,Tangerine Dream Game,"Listening to their 1986 album ""Green Desert"" and my partner asks if I'm working or playing a video game.  How cool is this music and how perfect for a video game?  This style is pretty ""in vouge"" now, and many people probably have no idea that they pioneered this stuff.  No idea if they would be into the idea, but a game paying homage to their music and influence would be awesome.  Some kind of retro game, of course."
adjzgs,i want to create a hero for my fighting game but..,I can't decide which is a better option. He's supposed to be like Ryu from Street Fighter. Either I make him a mixed MMA fighter with torn worn gloves and a champ looking for the next big challenge? Or make him a former warrior monk that left his village after his temple was destroyed?
adikfd,Park in time,"You start the game with a view from the top, the parking is semi-full, you have to drive the car to the nearest free parking area, when you look for the parking lot, the game zooms the scene up to see your car and a narrow corner of the road, you no longer see like a map.\n\nWhen you succeded to park, you go to the next round with a bigger one and a more crowded parking lot.\n\nIf you do not park in time, you lose a life.\n\nWhile you are driving you can find a clock that lengthens you the time, a chewing gum that slows you down the car and other gadgets.  \nWhat you think?  \n"
adhspv,2d beautiful pixel art hunting rpg,I wanted to make a really good looking 2d hunting RPG where you could go hunting in the day for normal animals and in the night you could go deeper into the forest and then you would be able to hunt supernatural beings. You could upgrade your hunting weapon along the way and forge new ones. I will expand on this idea as I thought that it was a good idea and there's nothing like this out there.
adetw2,Looking for theme/additional ideas for my hypercasual game,"My hyper casual game involves sending A's to the left and B's to the right, and I'm wondering if anyone has any fun ideas for a theme or reason for sending blocks to the left and right. I also added a bomb (tentative depending on theme) which can be defused with the middle button, and they will eventually be on a timer to force a game over. This may be replaced by a button that rotates the tiles allowing for 2 options per tile that drops. Maybe I'm overthinking it, maybe it needs more ideas, what do you think?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExample of how the game will work : [https://dreamy-wing-88681b.netlify.com/](https://dreamy-wing-88681b.netlify.com/) "
9hjeqy,John Wick-esque open world RPG!,"I would love to see an open world RPG shooter based on the John Wick universe! With the undercover crime society, the glammorous environments and ""casual violence"" present in the movies, alongside with the fun side characters and ""npcs"" (like the gun/suit vendors from the second movie).  \nYou would get to create your own character and decide how they would ascend,  by being an hitman and getting big bounties, building an crime empire or other things like this.  \nIf you screwed up, you could get a bounty on your head, and every single NPC out there could be a killer after you!  \nIt's just an idea, and i think that maybe an small team could pull it off by using an cool 2D aesthetic (maybe something along the neon lines of Hotline Miami?), but i really would like to see it done!"
9hi2hg,Black and White Sketch sidescroller,*this is my first post so I'm not too sure but here goes* \n\nThe game would be completely black except for the player being a white 2D sketched stickman with a light radius around him. The scenery will be similar style to the player (white sketch) yet will only show up if it is in the light radius. It will have a dark western theme with the player being made to feel extremely isolated and lost if not too careful. \n\nThe objective of the game would be to find out what has gone on in the town both which would be done through gameplay and backstory (not entirely sure on the details here). \n\nIf someone wants to do it I'd love to see how it goes and could maybe provide some basic ms paint sketches if this sounds too confusing.\nThanks and hope you all like it.

9hde3z,A Top Down Base Building/Defending Game About Cells And Evolution,"It's like AoE but you instead defend your base with your cells. You can move them just like in AoE by selecting and left clicking to attack/move. You start with the main cell\nthat moves slowly and is unable to split and some worker cells. You will collect resources like\nATP for multiplying your troops or moving them, Sugar, salt and other minerals for special\ntroops. There will be lots of enemy types and mostly random. You need to use different\nstrategies to defend your base. For example, when a new type of virus comes to your base,\nyou need to get a sample and give it to the main cell, then research and easily defeat them\nnext time.\nYou are going to get evolution points as you kill enemies and collect DNA's from them, and\nuse it to research new troops and upgrades. Collect amino acids to synthesize special\nantibodies. And maybe build walls with special materials, and so on. It's an open idea, i am\nthinking to make this game but it needs more depth and improvements.\n\nFeedback is appreciated."
9hbkr6,Need some plot ideas for a current-day RPG where you recruit people to your cause,"To give you some context I can't put in the title,\n\nI want to make a turn-based RPG where you form a group from recruiting members, mostly enemies that fight you on your path, and a subset of that group is your party. It'd work not too unlike Pokémon. Now I need a plot that justifies that mechanic.\n\nI have decided a few things. The game will be on a current-day setting - most likely in a fictional universe - and characters would have a certain set of superpowers, while also justifying the setting not being completely different. Below is what I came up with. It has a bunch of holes right now, but here's what the plot looks like right now:\n\n&gt;Everyone wakes up to find out they have superpowers. Nobody understands what's happening, but some people take advantage of their newfound powers to take over the government and start a dictatorship. Turns out this same group is part of a conspiracy, which found out how to gain these powers, but the side effect is that everyone else gains powers as well.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A month after the superpower phenomenon, our protagonists start organizing a resistance, while training their powers to be able to eventually overthrow the tyrants. The game is basically them going out there, recruiting both bypassers and criminals that try to mug them with their powers. As the group grows, they liberate cities they go through, until they eventually get to the central government.\n\nOf course that begs some questions:\n\n* Why conspire to get superpowers if everyone else also gets it?\n* Which group would benefit the most from superpowers-for-everyone? I'm assuming the military, since they are already trained for combat, but don't they currently have the upper hand already by having weapons? Why risk it?\n* Wouldn't that tyranny be easy to combat if superpowers level the field?\n\nI need a good excuse for each of these items, plus others that I didn't think of. Either that or come up with another plot in some or most points. Anyway, that's why I'm asking! ;)"
9haqa6,A top-down pixelated arena of spaceships. Where no match will(statistically) ever be the same.,"A top-down, pixelated arena of 20 ships that fight to the death with a variety of weaponry. \n\nThe ships can fire a variety of weapons at each other and each have a health bar starting at 1000 until it is depleted into 0. There is a field of asteroids in the middle of the play area that each have 80 to 10 health, depending on their size. They are spawned randomly and can be used for cover or strategic plays. All projectiles except laser weaponry are blocked by asteroids. At 5:00, a solar flare destroys all remaining asteroids, leaving opponents vulnerable. Powerups like health kits, cooldown reducers, and shields can also spawn randomly, or in a abundance around Supply Stations. Which should always be bustling with activity. \n\nThe main menu has 6 buttons. Play, quit, settings, training mode, and weapons. Nothing else. \n\nControls are WASD to move(touchpad for mobile) and mouse to aim. Weapons reload when their clip is empty, and weapons usually only have one shot per clip. Others have a continuous reload system. \n\nOnce you start the game, 5 weapons from an inventory of 30 or 40 will be selected for you and your opponent. You can get repeats of weapons and your opponent gets different ones. So no match is ever the same. The match ends when there is one player left on the field. Different modes can be thought of later, like team vs team, capture the flag, and stuff like that. \n\nLoadouts will be unique, but they can also have restrictions. Like for some weapons, certain amounts of them have to be limited for you to actually do something. Like the radar, which deals no damage. If you get 5 radars, what's the fun in that? \n\nThese 5 weapons all have unique stats and play styles. Here are some examples:\n\nPhoton Missile:    \nThe most balanced of all missiles, deals 100 damage in a medium radius. Like all other missiles, once you fire it, it stays at the fired location and then shoots towards your opponent in a straight line with tremendous speed. 7 second reload time. \n\nRailgun:\nA high-powered, extremely fast traveling rail gun that deals 450 damage and passes through all asteroids. Takes 1 second to charge up, in where you move 40% slower for the duration. 15 second reload time. \n\nLaser Minigun:\nA weapon that puts quantity over quality, spraying a set of 30 bullets that each deal 30 damage over 0.8 seconds. Each projectile has up to 15 degree deviation. Continuous reload, at 10 seconds when empty. \n\nLaser Net:\nA weapon that fires out a shotgun blast of laser nets that deal 50 damage to anything it comes in contact to. When activated again, the laser nets will gather at a midpoint and then shoot back into your ship through asteroids. Damaging anything it passes through for 350 damage. \n\nPlasma bolt:\nA fast-moving bolt of plasma that deals 75 damage to the first thing it hits. All attacks that land on the enemy after that will have x1.5 increased damage. You cannot get more than 3 of these per loadout.\n\nRadar: \nWhen activated, your screen zooms out further and you get +25% range on all your weapons for 5 seconds. You cannot get more than 2 of these per loadout. \n\nAsteroid Miner:\nA high-powered kinetic minigun that fires around every 0.1 seconds that deals 10 damage. Does double damage to asteroids. \n\nThe Tommy Nuke:\nA tremendously dangerous nuke. When fired, channels for 1.5 seconds before launching a large missile that deals 800 damage in a large radius around it. 45 second cooldown time. You cannot get more than 4 of these per loadout. \n\nThe Gravity Gun:\nFire on an asteroid or ship to pull them towards you. Once they touch you ship, you can launch it outwards again, damaging the ship/any other ships in the projectile’s path for up to 650 damage. 12 second reload time.\n"

9h853x,VTOL Evacuation,"I propose a game where the player flies an Attack/Transport Vertical Take Off and Landing (VTOL) aircraft in a scenario where an endless swarm of Zerg like Alien invaders are trying to consume a human population. The player's goal is to get as many humans to safety as possible before the swarm reaches the evacuation ships. The player can do this one of three ways:\n\n1) Manually pickup human survivors and drop them off at the Evacuation ship.\n\n2) Deploy ground transports that will pickup groups of humans and ferry them to the Evacuation ship.\n\n3) Destroy the forward elements of the alien swarm so that the humans can reach the Evacuation ship on foot.\n\nThis game will be played from a 3rd person top down perspective similar to AirMech. The player will have a limited quantity of ammunition, health, and fuel. These resources can be resupplied at the evacuation ship or at forward bases that have not been over run yet.\n\nResupplying takes time that the player could be saving more people.\n\nThe game starts with survivors scattered around the map with an Evacuation ship landing and signaling imminent enemy attack. At this point all survivors will walk towards the evacuation ship along the shortest path (probably roads). Scattered among the survivors will be VIP survivors dressed like scientists.\n\nThe player will have a map screen to show where their VTOL is relative to all the survivors, enemies, and Evacuation Ship\n\nThe player will be able to take off and land the VTOL anywhere there is enough open space. When the VTOL lands the player can Call for survivors to ""get to the choppa"". The player can kick survivors out of the chopper so they can continue on foot to the Evacuation ship. \n\nWhile on the ground the VTOL will be vulnerable to enemies who attack with melee.\n\nUltra light ground vehicles can be picked up by the player's VTOL by landing on it. Any people in the vehicle leave it before it is picked up. When the vehicle is dropped off it will automatically drive back to the Evacuation ship picking survivors up along the way (until maximum capacity is reached). Enemies can attack these vehicles to kill all the survivors aboard. If the vehicle makes it back to the evacuation ship its passengers will offload and walk to the evacuation ship leaving the vehicle ready to be picked up again.\n\nThe enemy will spawn outside the play area and move towards the closest humans, if unopposed they will overrun the fleeing humans and eat them. The player will be able to kill enemies with direct fire from the VTOL, however some enemies will shoot back.\n\nThe play session ends when there are no more survivors on the map either because they have been killed or have made it to the evacuation ship. The game will also end if the player's VTOL is destroyed. Score will be tallied by the number of survivors evacuated, if the player survived, and number of VIP survivors were evacuated.\n\nThe core idea of this game is to play as the looser. To experience a battle from the side which can not win but must find a way to make defeat less painful.\n\n\---\n\n*Well that was a brief overview of a game idea I had a while ago. I probably started on it a dozen times but always got distracted with another project. For those of you not familiar with AirMech, here is a wikipedia link:*\n\n[*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AirMech*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AirMech)\n\n*This game will probably have a similar control scheme but much slower paced action.*"

9gv6nn,A futuristic RPG set during an election,"Hi all,\n\nThis is my first time posting here and here is my idea for a game that I thought of.\n\nThe game will be a top-down RPG set during a general election that is being held in the future.  The game is set during an era when the fusion between humans and technology is beginning to accelerate - humans now have implants in their brains which mean they can now access information through a global cloud.\n\nThe hero is an employee on the campaign team for one of the two main parties/candidates in the election.  The hero discovers a plot by their party to manipulate people into voting for them by transmitting messages and signals to them via their implants that distort their perception of reality.  When the party finds out that the hero has uncovered their secret, they must go on the run.\n\nStylistically, it would consist of 16-bit-style graphics, with a strong cyberpunk aesthetic.\n\nOne possible idea I have for the gameplay is that the player can choose which party they work for and that could possibly influence how the narrative unfolds.\n\nWhat do people think of this concept so far?"

9gs10h,Gathering ideas for development show.,"Currently, [I am designing a series](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/9gilk8/a_game_dev_show/) in which I spend a weekend to develop a game, Ludum Dare style. I'm still designing and planning and determining whether or not I should do it. In the meantime, I am pulling up any and all concepts for projects that I can work on. This sub will be a resource to draw from, but if you have specific ideas, feel free to reply to this post so I can see your ideas!\n\nBackground on me: I am a developer of \~6 years of experience and worked with a variety of projects and engines. My personal favourite engine is Unity, but I have used CryEngine, Leadwerks, Unreal (3 and 4), GameMaker, RPGMaker, and GoDot. Because of my familiarity with Unity, I will likely use it for these projects. I have worked on RPG's, MMO's, MOBA's, survival games, and shooters. \n\nSummary of the rules: I must develop the game over the course of the weekend, so 48 hours of development time for me to use as needed, +20 hours for prototyping and testing. Essentially, I have 5 (Friday 7pm) hours before the weekend begins to plan my prototype and gather assets, and then another 15 (Monday 3pm) hours to be used only for bug testing and final touches before submitting. Actual development must be performed in the 48 hours in between. I can use any concepts and ideas, but I cannot use premade projects or tutorial projects. I can, however, reuse code and systems so long as it is not a complete project. (I cannot make an RPG game beforehand, and then reuse that project to make another RPG). I can use assets and individual systems, (such as Fungus), but I cannot use complete frameworks (such as UFPS or Ork Framework). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, feel free to hit me with anything you have, just remember that I cannot use premade projects or frameworks and I must develop the game in 48 hours. (so no AAA quality games. :P )\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFeel free to also offer opinions on the format and, if you are interested in this project, do let me know."
9grzeh,Apocalypse [Game Concept],"Apocalypse brings realistic gunplay and warfare to a free-to-play market. Putting groups of scavengers against each other in a quest to get the most loot in a Pixar-style world. Where death doesn’t just mean losing your stuff. But can mean losing your people...\n\nApocalypse is set in a destroyed version of New York. Supplying a mix of urban fights in the buildings and long-distance sniping in the overgrown forests. Players can use boats to traverse flooded areas of the city. Avoiding the risks of hypothermia and disease at the cost of alerting other players with noise. \n\nA.I monsters roam the wasteland. From hordes of shambling undead to winged beasts that scour the skies. All of which can be killed in a variety of ways. A horde of undead? Cook a Molotov. Giant bird just grabbed a friend? Craft a scope and shoot it down. The tactical possibilities are endless.\n\nThe main form of monetization are characters. Which can be earned by completing challenges or paying a small fee. Every character comes with a set of custom gear and look. Adding a new twist on the normal gameplay.\n\nMatches are about an hour long. Players must kill bosses around the map to find clues. Each of which lead them closer to a final boss they must kill. Once killed, they may call in a flair to bring the helicopter. Which will alert all remaining players and monsters to their location. If they escape, they win. \n\nWith realistic combat, a vast open word, and a fair monetization market. Apocalypse plans on taking the world by storm. "
9gp6sz,IDEA: The Stars Like Dust - the ultimate last word of 4x galactic gaming?,"&amp;#x200B;\n\n***This  is just a rough sketch, some very rudimentary ideas thrown on   paper...er, a webpage...this is by no means a complete game idea, just a   bunch of random thoughts thrown out there. If people have other ideas   or think this is good stuff, I'll make a more serious game document. At   this point I don't even know if people would be interested in a game  of  this complexity or not. I've always dreamed of making ""the ultimate""   galactic strategy game...something like aurora 4x or distant stars but   with even more meat on the bones. While I am a programmer, I don't  have the kind of know-how to even get a bare-bones model of this  working...but I would be interested to know if people find this idea  interesting...perhaps with some more work I could get a team together  that could get a basic model of this going...***\n\nThe   game will be a real-time, pausable strategy game. It will take place  in  a randomized galaxy that can be customized according to a few   parameters. There will be a certain number of races in any given game,   each with their own unique gameplay style.\n\nThe Player\n\nThe   player will play the role of a galactic statesman, guiding his faction   from humble pre-warpdrive era to galactic empire-hood. The player will   have some control of the economy, can direct colonization, can govern   planets or assign planetary governors, can direct fleets or appoint   admirals, can conduct espionage, can direct construction of planetary   infrastructure, space-stations, star-ships, and even   super-weapons...players will also direct diplomacy, signing treaties and   other such actions.\n\nThe player will be   able to design star-ships and star-bases, using many different   components, or they can buy designs from private companies. Everything   will be customizable...even the components themselves. The player can   design engines or laser emplacements if they choose (or buy specialized   ones from private companies) the only limiting factor is technological   levels, weight, and cost.\n\nSuper-weapons   will play a role in the game...they are massive and can be   customized...ultimately the player can even destroy entire star systems,   though they will suffer a massive diplomatic penalty for doing so.\n\nThere   will be several different resources in game, each of which are  required  for building and maintaining certain components. Some areas of  the  galaxy will be more rich than others, creating asymmetric  game-play and  encouraging economic warfare\n\nDIPLOMACY:  \nThe   player can sign mutual defense treaties, line-of-sight sharing   treaties, formal alliances, and federation treaties (federation treaties   are alliances but between multiple empires, not just one). They can   alternately close borders, declare war, and embargo other empires.\n\nECONOMIC MODEL:\n\nAs   time goes by, each empire will start to have certain private companies   arise, there will be mainly three types of industry: mining, trade,  and  military. These industries will arise without the player's direct   control, thus simulating actual economic growth. However the player can   interact with the companies by subsidizing or leveling tariffs,  building  infrastructure for them or conversely seizing assets, and some   government types will even allow the player to nationalize a industry   entirely, though doing so will be risky as it could cause other   industries to move away from one's empire.  The strength of each company   will be determined from the relative strength of the player's empire,   population, low company tax rates, and certain policies.\n\nMining   Companies – almost focus solely on mining planets and asteroids, can  be  nationalized, player can subsidize or level tariffs, can be granted   mining charters to build mining colonies, which are semi-independent   extensions of the host empire the mining company comes from, which   cannot be controlled by the player but have increased tax revenue\n\nTrading   companies – focus on trading with other planets within one's empire,   and can trade outside the empire with other races if certain policies   (like free-trade) are passed can be nationalized, player can subsidize   or level tarrifs\n\nMilitary Companies - can   be nationalized, player can subsidize or level tariffs, military   companies create designs and can be assigned research tasks for certain   military related tech, the player can buy designs or order a certain   number of ships from the military company…\n\nDifferent economic policies:\n\nFree   trade – allows trading companies to trade with all  empires, you make   less money off of taxes and you can't level tariffs on the trade   companies, but you get a diplomatic relations boost with the other   empires...they get a small boost to their income depending on your   economic power...\n\nRestricted trade – same   as free trade but you can select which empires you want the companies   to trade with...this helps if you are conducting economic warfare with   another empire\n\nAllow Mining Colonies –   allows the construction of semi-indepedent mining colonies that you   cannot control of directly tax, but they extend your borders just like a   normal colony and give a boost to the resource output of the mining   stations in the system\n\nDon't Allow Mining Colonies – duh\n\nAllow   private armies – allows all companies to build private armies, which   function to protect them from pirate and raider attacks, this can be   dangerous however, as if you anger or attempt to nationalize a industry   and their army is strong enough, they may go to war with you\n\nDis-allow   private armies – no private armies are allowed...however you must   protect the company from private attacks...if you don't then they may   decide to build a private army anyway\*\n\n\*ok, yeah this was inspired by the whole Trade Federation thing is sw. sue me."

9gjlky,AR Phone Hacking Game (Inspired by WatchDogs 2) (Different from Ingress),"So essentially this is my idea for a Phone AR Hacking game.\n\nI've called it ""Globe-Sploit"".\n\nI was inspired by WatchDogs 2 and Ingress to create a more hands on abstracted phone hacking game WITH the implementation of a home computer element where the phone would connect up to the home game and act accordingly (see below for more details)\n\nYes, I know it's long and quite complicated seemingly but it could be a thing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Globe-Sploit Ideas\n\n# Section One: Obtainable Items and Functionality\n\n## Software\n\n***Brute Force Tool***\n\nA device based tool used to determine attacks against a server, breach or player. The tool will determine the difficulty of the puzzles when hacking and determine how much time you have to do the puzzles. The tool runs on a program called **ATAX** .\n\n***Firewall Tool***\n\nA multi device based tool that is used to block other players from hacking you, make puzzles more difficult for invading players and giving them less time. Firewalls are also what you add to a server to stop players from taking your server. The tool runs on a program called **BLOKEM.**\n\n***IP Hasher***\n\nA device chance based tool that when equal/higher to another player's ping device level, will have a chance (25%) to scramble and hide your address, making you hidden on their device. Your device on their ping list will come up as an error. This effect will last for 10 minutes. These are unlocked at Level 10 and take time to reload after usage. Failed uses will only cut your reload back to half. Currency can also be used to buy extra charges for the IP Hasher, called **Energy Capsules**. The IP hasher runs on a program called **HIDE\_ME**\n\n***The Ping Device***\n\nA device based tool used to detect players and breaching opportunities in the radius. Recharges after one use, taking 1 minute to recharge. See below for details. The ping device runs on a program called **PEEK\_ABOO**\n\n***ByteMine***\n\nA server based utility which is used to mine Bytes in order to let the player spend them later on. This can be placed in a public and private server for XP and Byte collection while they dominate the server. By upgrading it heavily, you can increase the amount of money and XP you can earn from the ByteMine application The utility runs on a program called **GIMMIE\_GIMIMIE**\n\n***BitMine***\n\nA smaller, less detectable version of ***ByteMine*** used by **Rogues.** Essentially the same as ***ByteMine.*** See lower for details.\n\n***IDE Dock***\n\nA private server based utility which is used to upgrade your software by loading your software and the IDE Console into your private server and working it up without walking. This utility has a rare upgrade item drop chance and is mostly more efficient when not playing the game (sleeping or whatever). The utility runs on a program called **RESURGE.**\n\n***PowerShare***\n\nA multi device based program that allows two devices to share their processing power.\n\nThe device based program can be used to implant a virus to essentially drain the power of a device when requested. The closer the host is, the more power you can drain, which will then in game translate to energy for other software based utilities like **overclocking the IDE**, **Recharging the Ping Device or IP Hasher**, **or even draining the battery of the virtual device.** To get rid of this virus, you must either upgrade your firewall until it is higher than the level of the PowerShare virus or you attempt to **decompile** the code via puzzles. The higher the PowerShare, the harder the puzzles.\n\nAlternatively, you can also use PowerShare to give power to fellow team mates, and also if the players are all **verified friends**, then they can combine their processing power to **overclock their bruteforcing abilities**, essentially making the group more powerful when in range of each other, although a constant connection between the players must be kept. Maximum group size is **4** (although this is debatable).\n\nThe server based program can be inserted into a public server when the player has successfully dominated the server, in replacement of the **ByteMine** program. This means that when they come in a relative distance of the server, they can request power or charge from it, essentially **recharging the virtual device**, and also **initiate any broken layers of the server**.\n\nThe device is auto installed into the private server, as it is the way you recharge your device. Unlike other servers, the private server always has a full charge, so you can reuse the powershare option as much as you want when logging into your private server.\n\nPowerShare runs off a program called **CHARGR**\n\n## Items\n\n***IDE Console***\n\nUsed to code programs, considering player has required parts. Players must use the IDE console and then walk the distance required to finish code or load it to the private server at home. You can run many at once.\n\n***Boosters***\n\nUsed to add additional effects to your actions. Can be found at data points (rare) and breach opportunities (uncommon).\n\n*X-Chip (uncommon)*\n\nEither:\n\nAttach it to a data points to get extra breach opportunity spawns in 0.5 mile area.\n\nAttach to self to receive more resources from data points and addition XP and Bytes\n\n*Y-Chip (Rare)*\n\nHalf's required walking time for coding software upgrades in IDE’s\n\n*Z-Chip (Very Rare)*\n\nDoubles up your firewall placed on a server, meaning players defeating your wall will have to do it twice over.\n\n***Upgrade Items***\n\nItems used to boost level of tools.\n\nThey include; *ATAK Patches, BLOKEM Patches, HIDE\_ME Patches, PEEK\_ABOO Patches,*\n\n*GIMMIE\_GIMMIE Updates, RESURGE Updates, CHARGR Updates, BYTEMINE Updates*\n\n***SSD Mods***\n\nMods are obtainable perma boosts that can be found in data points, breaches and server completion rewards. Mods have rarities: *Kilo, Mega, Tera, Peta and Exa (equating to Common, Uncommon, Rare, Special, Legendary and Exotic rarities)*. Only one can be equipped at once and there is a minimum 30 minute cool down between switching of mods in all cases (max will be determined on the rarity and power of the mod)\n\n*Kilo Mods*\n\nKilo Mods are the standard mods you find in the game. They can be found at data points uncommonly, breaches &amp; public servers rewards they are almost guaranteed, if not common. They offer very small boosts like 1-5% boosts in XP gain, Byte Gain, Time to Complete puzzles etc. 25 Kilo Mods of the same type can then be transformed into a Mega Mod of the same type.\n\n*Mega Mods*\n\nMega Mods are more uncommon than other mods as the one up from a Kilo Mod, being able to be crafted from 25 Kilo Mods. They can also be found at data points rarely, with breaches finding them uncommonly and server rewards commonly. They offer 5-10% boosts in factors mentioned above. 20 Mega Mods of the same type make a Giga Mod of the same type.\n\n*Giga Mods*\n\nGiga Mods are rare mods which are very rarely found at data points, breaches give them at a rare level and servers rewarding them uncommonly. Giga Mods offer a 10-15% boost of mentioned factors above with a super rare chance of offering increase in item gain as well. 15 Giga Mods take it up to a single Tera Mod\n\n*Tera Mods*\n\nTera Mods are very rare mods which are extremely rarely found at data points, breaches give them at a very rare level and servers also jumping up to very rare level. Tera mods offer a 15-25% boost of the mentioned factors above plus now they can offer increases in items as well like upgrade items instead of general XP or Bytes. 10 Tera Mods of the same type can make a Peta Mod.\n\n*Peta Mods*\n\nPeta Mods are extremely rare mods, found at an impossibly rare chance at data points, breaches extremely rarely give them and so do server rewards. Peta Mods offer a 25-50% boost to the mentioned factors above. Peta Mods can also instead of giving a boost can rarely offer specific increases in certain obtainment of items called **Core Abilities**. They can offer increases in certain items like boosters and even other mods, although this is a rare chance in Peta Mods. 5 Peta Mods therefore equal an Exa mod of a random ability. **Core Abilities** will be specified soon.\n\n*Exa Mods*\n\nExa Mods are the rarest of all mods, being unobtainable at data points and breaches, but being extremely rare at server rewards. Exa Mods are very specific mods, offering specific advantages over other mods and players. Special Exa Mods exist as follows:\n\n***XP Engine -*** *Rolling XP Multiplier (The more you do actions, the higher it gets, caps at 2.5X)*\n\n***Byte Engine -*** *Rolling Byte Multiplier (The more you do actions, the higher it gets, caps at 2.5X)*\n\n***UltiConsole -*** *Knocks a third off all Console IDE upgrade distance (stacks with Y Chip and works with private server IDE)*\n\n***DataSale -*** *Prices of items at Data points are all discounted a third off the price*\n\n***UpDate -*** *You get better rewards from data points, breaches and server rewards*\n\n***GhostWalker -*** *IP Hashers will always hide you when used*\n\n***PuzzleBreaker -*** *Any extra time you save on one puzzle is rolled over into the next puzzle, giving that puzzle more time to complete*\n\n***SuperPing -*** *You have the opportunity to reveal 1 - 3 hidden players when pinging, they will have a ghost icon next to their name*\n\n***AcceleROM -*** *By shaking your device, you generate a small amount of power. Adding this to the “SolarCharge” will create the “Kinetiks” mod*\n\n***SolarCharge -*** *As long as the sun rise has happened, your device battery will charge a small amount at a time if you are out of range of your private server (essentially outside). Adding an acceleROM will transform it into the “Kinetiks” mod*\n\n***Kinetiks (Craft Only) -*** *A special mod, where as long as you are walking, you will generate considerable amounts of power to the phone. Craft Only Mod. Crafted by: (x1) SolarCharge, (x1) AcceleROM.*\n\n***X-Cellent  -*** *You will obtain a X-Chip each time you beat a server*\n\n***RealCore -*** *You will receive a Core Coin for every 10K you walk with the mod on*\n\n*(More will be added as the game goes along)*\n\n***DataFrenzi (Craft Only) -*** *A special mod that knocks off a half of the price at Data points AND better rewards from data points ONLY. Craft only Mod. Crafted by: (x2) DataSale, (x2) UpDate (debatable crafting normality)*\n\n***ShadowKey (Craft Only) -*** *A special mod that allows normal players to scan and access a Black Market spot. They will only be revealed if in the local area of the player and players can use the full functionality of that Black Market while there. Once out of its area, it will disappear. Craft Only Mod. Crafted by: (x2 SuperPing) (x1 DataSale) (x1 GhostWalker)*\n\n*MORE WILL BE ADDED TO THE GAME IN UPDATES, THESE ARE BASIC IDEAS*\n\n**Energy Capsules**\n\nPurchasable items which can be used to give a quick charge boost to the device itself, or specifically other tools. Charging the device allows equal distribution of the power across devices while charging one device can either charge it or leave it some overdraft power to use later. They can be purchased at Data Stores with a chance of reduced prices, or in the Quick Shop in the players device which will cost a standard amount of Bytes.\n\n## Power\n\nPower is a key element in Globesploit. It’s not that hard to obtain, but neither is it to take away.\n\nPower won’t work like your average game like Candy Crush and other energy based games, where as soon as you run out of energy, you are incompetent for an hour.\n\nEach player will have a **Virtual Machine (VM)** which will be a visual representation of the a device. The device will have its own battery life and sure enough, once you start trying to perform heavy tasks on it, it will start to run out of battery. Power, however, can be found really easily but it is required to keep the game from being a grindy game and would encourage players not to overly play the game.\n\nFirst source of power is by leaving the phone literally on charge at home. The private server will charge the phone up instantly as soon as the user logs in, providing a boost of power.\n\nYou can also provide power for your resources and utilities via hacking players, to which would allow the hacker to take the other persons power and use it for themselves.\n\nYou can set up PowerShare on friends and share power with each other, allowing you to become stronger allies in the future.\n\nYou can set up PowerShare at a public server instead of ByteMine, so that each time you pass the server, you can collect the power that PowerShare has generated. You can also, instead, feed Bytes into the server and it will charge its external battery for you and other players to benefit from.\n\nEach Data Grab has the option to spend money on charging the phone also. You can either buy an Energy Capsule for later use or you can use the in built power supply at selected data grabs. Finally you can also buy them from the Quick Store for a standard price in Bytes and obtain an Energy Capsule for your own use, whether it be device or certain software.\n\nPower to recharge your abilities will be generated from the VM’s battery so when you do an action, the ability will take a portion of the battery and use it to recharge, but not a significant amount so that the player is able to keep playing but not grind. You will see this in the control panel of the phone.\n\n## Currency\n\nIn game currency: Bytes\n\nPaid currency: Core Coins\n\n## Micro Transaction\n\nCalled “Core Coins”\n\nCan buy wallpapers, pointers, themes ect.\n\n## Radar Functionality\n\n***Ping Ability***\n\nScans local area for breaching opportunities and loading players into the local players list (without exact location for privacy reasons… duh). Can also be used to allow players to view the currency store at a data point when they ping the point to check the prices of items and recharge of power costs.\n\nCan be used once every certain amount of minutes, depending on upgrades. Currency can also be used to buy extra charges for the ping, called **Energy Capsules**.\n\nUpgrades include: radius, accuracy, speed of pulse, cool down time, data point information shown.\n\nEvery upgrade will also upgrade it’s version by 0.1.\n\n## Upgrading Software/Mods\n\n***Basic Knowledge***\n\nEvery time you upgrade your software, its version will go up by 0.1. All tools start off as V1.0 and as you upgrade, they will go up a version.\n\n***Software***\n\nSoftware is upgraded by collecting parts from data points, gathering sufficient Bytes. Once you have the parts, use an ***IDE Console*** to begin coding the upgrade, walking the required distance that the IDE states, or docking the Console into the players **Private Server.**\n\n***Mods***\n\nUsing bytes to upgrade but very expensive. Eventually Core Coins will be required to upgrade.\n\n# Section Two: The Map and Functionalities\n\n## Data Grabs\n\nPoints on the map players have to walk to, to collect upgrade items (common) and possibly boosters (rare) and mods dependant on their rarity. They can have *X-Chips* attached to them to increase spawn rate of breach opportunities in a 0.5 mile radius. You can also spend currency at them to see what items they have in stock and also request a charge of your devices power for a small amount of currency. Prices vary at different points by the hour so finding the best deal requires walking. These prices can be viewed once the player has pinged the data grab from a distance or can be viewed by checking in at the data grab.\n\n## Breachment Opportunities\n\nMini-events which spawn on infrastructure which can give you XP and Bytes for upgrades. They can also give you mods with a rare chance, and a specific type of upgrade item depending on its colour. Breachment Opportunities have levels of difficulty and are accessible to people of only a certain brute force level (Easy, Medium and Hard). They can be found by the ping feature and are accessible by walking near to one. They are only available for a few hours and then are despawned from the map. Players can also have the option to play one more puzzle on the Breach, harder than the other puzzles, and double their rewards. However, if they fail, they only get half their resources back.\n\n## Public Servers\n\nServers are cooperative “King of the Hill” type points. Players bring down the current team’s firewalls, placed by players, by completing and cracking puzzles on each layer of the total firewall. Once defeated, player’s can then proceed to add layers of their own firewall, essentially dominating that server. While on a server, player’s obtain additional XP and Bytes every day they are on the server, or setting up PowerShares. Public servers can be used as charging stations also, allowing players to pay a fee to charge up the server’s external paybank battery for other players to use. The player making that sacrifice will then get XP for each player that uses the free charges for their devices. Players can also use these servers as an opportunity to trade with other players, trading upgrade resources at an equal trade rate so one party cannot give ridiculous amounts to the other as a form of cheating.\n\nOnce a server has been taken over, there is a buffer time of 1 hour to allow users to utilise the server for a while before it becomes vulnerable to other players again. This gives other players time to find the server and place their defences on it so that the next time the buffer ends, players have less of a chance to be left to fend for themselves on a single server. This gives the game more dynamic and allows the game to be increased in difficulty. Max amount of defences on a server at once is 10. Once this is reached, external players can only fix up other players defences using Bytes, but get XP for doing so. There is also a rare chance of gaining upgrade resources from patching a firewall.\n\nPlayers will also have the option to **Probe Ports** in the server to essentially test the servers strength by fighting it off. This in result will reward the player bonus XP and strengthen the server if need be. This is also a way to test for **Backdoors** in a server (check Rogue players part below) with their bruteforce tool. Their bruteforce tool MUST be equal or higher to the backdoor in order to defeat it and take it down. The backdoors position will correspond with the level of its firewall on the server. For example, if you have a level 3, 5, 6, 8 firewall in that order and a rogue has placed a level 7 backdoor, the backdoor will be defeated in between 6 and 8. If its level is the same as another players firewall, it will get placed behind that firewall.\n\nTo defeat a server, you need to initiate a **Server Hack** which is an event that any given player can start on a server. Other players can then join in the **Server Hack** to speed up the Firewall breaking process. The more players solving puzzles at one firewall at once, the faster it will be broken. Once broken, all participating players, even if they didn’t finish the server and either suffered virtual device power loss or they ran out of puzzle time, will recieve rewards. The more you participate the better. Players can opt out of continuing after beating each firewall on a server and collect the runtime rewards they have earned at that point in time. **However, if a player manages to beat a server all by themselves, they get a single player bonus reward of Bytes and XP (called One Man Army booster)**. **Rogue Players will get even more rewards since they are unable to claim servers for themselves**.\n\n## Player/Private Servers\n\nPlayer servers are different to usual servers. The player would set the server where they live, via *either* USB and wall charged device that interfaces with an app (wall charged and USB so that when the PC shuts down, the server is still applicable) or just a computer app, and the server acts as a farm and protective home base for the player. The players server can be upgraded with mining tools to mine currency and can also dock your phone to the in-server IDE Console and slowly build up the software you are currently upgrading.  You can recharge your device at the server with PowerShare and it acts as a cloak for the player, hiding themselves within the intranet of the private server.\n\n**Verified friends** of the player can use the server as a temporary charging place if the player authorises it, and they can also be invited for a temporary cloaking session around the private server if said player authorises it also. There are charges in Bytes for the more players cloaking on a server and charging, which will be at the expense of the players themselves, chipping into a pot to allow themselves to charge and cloak along with a hosting fee for the main player. The first hour is **free** but then after there will be a charge for every extra hour used.\n\n**Verified Family Members** who have also got the game due to another member can use the server alongside the other family members, doubling up byte farms but the farms will be distributed fairly, reserving a separate farm for each member. The more family members the better. There is a limit to the amount of family members and devices that do not play the game out and about actively and that follow a pattern will be questioned and removed if needed\n\n## REEEbay (The Black Market)\n\nAn additional shop that is exclusive to any **Rogue** players or players with the extremely rare **ShadowKey** mod.\n\n*See “Rogue” section for more details.*\n\n# Section Three: The User Interface\n\n## The Map\n\nWe obviously have the map which allows you to view your location in the world and game. You can also see the playerlist when you have pinged by dragging from the side and looking at the pop out menu slab.\n\n## Quick Menu\n\nThe quick menu can be launched from the map itself and has quick links to actions and other features of the game, like Pinging, IP Hiding and Engaging with Players. You can adapt the quick menu for your own shortcuts and needs.\n\n## Player\n\nAn overview page of your achievements, statistics and so on. You can also change your public information here and your interface for your device.\n\n## Multiplayer Page\n\nThis is a page specifically for the PowerShare feature and Friends and Family. Checking up on them and being able to connect can all be done here.\n\n## Tools List\n\nA feature in the menu which allows you to view all your tools\n\n## Inventory\n\nThis allow you to look at all the items you have and equip your mods\n\n## The Forge\n\nThis allows you to prepare certain upgrade tools and mod combinations so that you are able to perform them. You can craft higher mods here and also assemble your upgrade materials for the software update\n\n## Console IDE\n\nThe Console IDE page allows you to look at the progress of your currently upgrading software(s) and cancel any you don’t want to continue. You can upgrade a maximum of 3 pieces of software at once at the beginning, and once you can upgrade the Console IDE to Console IDE+, you can run 6 at once.\n\n## My Servers\n\nThis is a list of servers you have either hacked before or are in control of at the moment, you can send a ping request to check on the server and see what maintenance it needs as long as you control it. If your Ping Device is higher level than the overall level of the server though, you can ping into an enemy server to check the current status of the server from a far way away so you know what to prepare. You can also see how many active users are using the server at the time.\n\nYou can also interface with your own private server in this page to collect resources, dock your upgrade research, upgrade your server and so on.\n\n## Settings\n\nThe game settings for users\n\n# Section Four: The Clans\n\nThere will be **Four Clans** and a **Rogue** option as well for more single player experiences.\n\n## The Clans\n\nThe 4 clans will be:\n\n**The Red team**\n\n**The Blue team**\n\n**The Green team**\n\n**The Orange team**\n\nThese clans will hold no specific boosters or titles to which will make them special but it should equalise the players out more. Each team will fight it out with each other, dominating servers and neutralising whole geographical zones in their name.\n\n## Going “Rogue”\n\nThe **Rogue** option (usually a magenta colour) is a special challenge class you can take if you would like to play the game differently than the standard player. There are few advantages and disadvantages to going rogue which will change the play style of the game completely.\n\nYou can either **start the game** as a rogue or you can **abandon your clan** and go rogue mid game (this decision can only be made at a lower level in order to reduce the number of rogue players at a higher level). You may also revert from being rogue up until Level 10 if the game style isn’t for you and then go rogue again but you can only do this cycle once. Once you have gone rogue, gone to a clan and then abandoned them, you cannot go back. There will be certain progress penalties to this but unsure at the moment. If you have started in a clan, abandoned them to go rogue and then wanting to go back while under level 10, you will have to send a plea form to the contact option with an explanation as to why you want to go back, and this will only be offered ONE TIME.\n\nIf you are sure however that you want to be rogue for the rest of the game after reading a contract, you may solidify your option and unlock the Black Market immediately in the game (*see below for further details).*\n\n**Rogue** can be considered as a harder difficulty setting for the general player but does come with some advantages to which you can use, and of course disadvantages.\n\n***PowerShare Disability (NEG)***\n\nThe **PowerShare** ability that you have to share power with others is completely disabled. You cannot team up with other rogues and other players in order for this game style to work. You still may steal power off others but with friendly players, it won’t work.\n\n***Ability to hack ANYONE (POS)***\n\nA Rogue is not bound by any team so therefore ANYONE is up for the taking. This means that you can hack and powershare with anyone you like and offers a more free experience in the world of GlobeSploit.\n\n***No server “domination” (NEG)***\n\nYou cannot own a server. You are free to take it down but you cannot dominate a server as a rogue.\n\n***Server Backdoors (POS &amp; NEG)***\n\nAn option exclusive to the rogue players is being able to **backdoor servers** in order to have access to them later on. Once you have taken down a server or you see a server that has just been taken down by a team, you can strike while it is weak and upload a backdoor into the server, and this can only be done when it is weak. The backdoors level will be dependant on your firewall level and any players on the team of the server of which you have backdoors will have the option to **Probe Ports** on their server and take down your backdoor, as long as they have a high enough bruteforce tool to detect it.\n\n*Backdoors*, however, have their advantages. You can use backdoors to steal off a servers power. If a player has placed a power donation into the server, you can take ONE charge from the server itself (just so you can’t constantly steal from it).\n\nYou can set up a smaller version of *ByteMine* called **BitMine** which is essentially the same as ByteMine just a smaller and less detectable. This serves as an advantage as players will have a harder time trying to find *BitMine* and on servers as well. It still uses *ByteMine* upgrades though.\n\n*PowerShare* can also be used on the servers as usual, using it to power your device.\n\n**Trade Injections,** unlocked at a high level, allow you to benefit from a trades on a server. As a trade is ongoing, you are able to inject yourself in the trade and catch a few items from the trade itself. The ACTUAL TRADE will not be affected in the slightest, you will just benefit slightly from its event.\n\n***No Trading (NEG)***\n\nThe trading system for a rogue is not available.\n\n***REEEBay (The Black Market) (POS &amp; NEG)***\n\nIn addition to the regular stores, the rogues will have free access to the underground **Black Market** from Level 11 upwards which are found on the map. You may also get the Black Market from the start if you solidly confirm your contract to the Rogue option, essentially stopping you from ever reverting back. There is ONE black market to a named town and 3 - 5 to a city dependant on its size.\n\nThe Black Market is a place to buy and sell items. Each item has a bidding price and a buy now price. The bidding price is determined by the player within a range of choosable prices and the buy now price is determined by the game with influence with the Black Markets soul purpose: cheaper prices. Many items can be sold and bought on this system.\n\nThe only issue is that you may end up paying more than you asked for an item. The Black Market takes a small commission off your items sold and adds a market tax to your items bought. You just have to watch out for the percentage tax on the items and workout how much you’d really be paying for it and whether the deal is worth it.\n\n***Data Point Hinderance (NEG)***\n\nAs you are not a verified clan member, some data points may up the price of items due to this. They will only be a small increase in price but enough to reap a disadvantage of being a Rogue.\n\n***Data Point Traps (High Level Skill) (POS)***\n\nFor sticking the game out as a Rogue, at a certain level, you will get the opportunity to place bait onto a Data Point. These baits will come up as items on the store. When a player goes to buy the item, they will get the item and you will get 50% of the money from that transaction. The way the bait works is random, but whatever item the bait decides to make itself as, you will get money from that. Prices will always be fair and the item can only be bought once. There is a 10 minute cool down between the bait being sold and placing a new bait down on the same data point.\n\nOnly issue is, is that this skill is unlocked further into the game but players will reap the benefit of this system when reaching that level. One bait can be placed per data point at a time.\n\n\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*Further Ideas will be added in the future but this is a general idea. It is weak at the moment but I feel it has potential* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet me know what you think."
9ghfms,Birdserk,"This game appeared to me in a dream, thought I'd share it here.\n\nThe game loosely follows the story of Berserk (a dark fantasy manga) except all the human characters are replaced with anthropomorphic birds and you play as Griffith rather than the manga's protagonist (Guts).\n\nIn this game Griffith is a falcon with an angelic beauty which almost seems unfitting for the brutal world around him and others cannot help but be captivated by his presence and skill. He wields a beautiful sabre and is the leader of a band of mercenaries. Despite common birth his goal is to own kingdom even if it means making difficult sacrifices along the way. \n\nThere will be a lot of combat but the main focus of the game will be strategy, planning, making difficult decisions and winning people over through charm, skill, or manipulation.\n\nThe other main character is Guts. In this game he is a large crow who uses a sword as large as himself and survives against seemingly impossible odds. Apart from combat skills and courage he is almost an exact inversion of Griffith, traditionally masculine, straight forward, is resistant to getting close to people. He eventually opens up and becomes your closest companion but later becomes the antagonist for reasons I can't go in to without spoiling it for those who haven't experienced Berserk yet..\n\nLater on in the story there are demonic creatures but in this game they are represented by deformed humans who's only desire is to consume bird's flesh.\n\n&amp;#x200B;"

So if you could make a simple yet fun dinosaur game, what would it be? Let's go beyond a survival kinda game though, because survival games are plentiful..."
9gczxo,New competetive type game,"Hi guys, \n\nI would really appreciate if you read this full post and tell me what you think of it and what I can improve.\n\n So I have had this idea for a while where I want to create a 6v6 competetive base building game. It is kind of a mix between a survival game and a moba.\n\nEach team will get a spawner which they have to place down on a location they think is best. If the spawner isn't placed before one of the team members has died he can't spawn back into the game untill it is placed. The objective of the game is to destroy the other teams spawner. If a team is wiped out before they have placed their spawner they are also defeated. Players can use different kind of materials to build a base around their spawner to protect it. The game takes place on a island with lots of trees and rocks and even some animals on it. These are used to build up your base and to stay alive. In the first 2 minutes there is a wall in the middle of the island that seperates the 2 teams so they can safely put down their spawner. After 2 minutes the wall dissapears and everyone can roam over the island without limitations.\n\nBefore the game starts each player can choose between 3 kind of classes: the builder, the hunter and the gatherer. Each class with its own specifik skill set.\n\nThe builder: This class is very good to build up your base, this class can build much quiker and more advanced things than the other classes. This class is also very good to forge weapons.\n\nThe hunter: This class is best for hunting food and to kill and protect gatherers so the other team falls behind on building their base or to protect your own gatherer from getting killed. the hunter is also very good with the bow that he gets for free when spawning. Players can also die from starvation so it's the hunters job to make sure that there is food for everyone.\n\nThe gatherer: This class is used to gather wood, stone and other materials. This guy is very strong and he can carry way more items then the hunter and builder can but he is very weak in combat and needs much protection. \n\nPlayers earn experience by doing things there character is supposed to do, for example, a builder gets experience for building a wall or making a weapon but if he decides to hunt for materials he won't get any experience from it. Experience points can be used to upgrade perks which are specifik for every class. If a hunter gets enough experience he can choose to upgrade his aim, or to receive more food from killing animals. These are just examples I want to create a very large skill tree to really make players think about what they should spend their experience on.\nThis game takes a lot of teamplay and strategie to win. Players can choose to play a very aggresive playstyle from minute one and try to get the enemy spawner in the first few minutes by picking 3 hunters, but this tactic can also backfire because if the other team manages to survive they will have lots of materials to build a stronger base and better weapons so they will be much stronger in the late game.\n\nWhen the players are selecting their class they can't see what the other team has picked. So it's always a gamble on what kind of tactic you're going to use. Are you going to sacrifice a gatherer for another hunter? This might lead to following behind on technology and materials.\n\nIf a player dies he is still in the game but he has to wait a certain amount of time depending on what stage of te game you are in. So if a player dies in the first 5 minutes of the game he will have to wait for 2 minutes but if someone dies in the 30th minute of the game he has to wait for 10 minutes. This is a crucial part of the game because dying really matters. If a hunter dies you're gatherers will become unprotected so one of the other teams hunter might hunt him down. If a gatherer dies, then your builder will have a lot less materials to build with and the other team will have a stronger base.\n\nThere are a lot of different types of animals on the island ranging from chickens to bears. Chickens are very weak and won't give you a lot of food and experience but are an easy target. Bears are the strongest animals on the island, they will take a lot of damage and they can hit very hard. But if you manage to kill them they will give you a lot of food and experience. There will be lot's of other animals.\nThere are also a lot of different materials on the island. in the first stages of the game wood and stone will be the most important to build your base but later on materials like iron and sulvur will become very important to make weapons and ammunition. There will be more materials.\n\nI am also trying to implement some elements into the game that can turn the game around. For example something like a baron in league of legends where the losing team can get a buff that brings them back into the game for a certain amount of time. I was thinking of some random events that happen in the game where there is some sort of giant animal and if a team kills it they gain a massive amount of xp.\n\nI know that it would be almost impossible to make this game but i wanted to share my idea anyway."
9gc81l,Idea I had in a dream this morning,"I had a very good dream this morning after I woke up and this is what i remembered and thought I would share with you all.\n\nIt had a function where you pick color combination of like 4 or 5 colors. and depending on the colors would set the game mode/characters to be used/arena. In dream they had 3 different shades of blue, 1 of green and people knew that combination and told the lobby host to choose that so they knew what they were playing. (I guess if you don't know combination would be a surprise in game what will appear) So with this concept there would be many, many different ways to play the game with many scenarios. It had a battle royale game mode, a capture the flag mode that i saw. (Played in both). The battle royale was a little different as you were waiting until the end to find the point to start capturing points, or eliminate the rest of the players with your team. As it closed, doors would automatically close to make routes being taking much harder. HUGE open world and a lot of interactive environment. You could climb buildings in the cities, go through buildings. Day/night cycle that was played during a single game. Humans, non humans (had someone playing as a Rhino humanoid on two legs, very tall, very muscular, had demon summons of wolf like creatures), respawns, customization for weapons which you could add/take attachments from weapons.  The center of map would show the divide of teams so if you cross it you know you will be in enemy territory."

9g7l6m,"An Augmented Reality social MMO that will change the world, literally!","This ain’t really a game idea. But if Second Life counts as a game than this will too.\n\nI just want you to imagine buying a set of glasses. You put them on and with a click of a button, the world is suddenly snowy. Using AI and spacial recognition, it turns all the trees white and virtual snow all around you will appear. Walk a kilometre, hear a loud roar and see a massive Dragon flying around your neighbourhood. Someone else is wearing glasses behind you! He tells you he put it there using the platform for everyone with the glasses to see! However, this guy doesn’t look normal. He has demon horns, red flaming eyes and appears to not wear any glasses at all! Mind you, he just filtered them out to be invisible to other AR glasses wearers.\n\nImagine being in the city at bright daytime. Put the glasses on and choose what setting you’d like to see, do you want a red sky? Perhaps an adblocker? With a bit of an interaction it will appear. Want to show your friends your anime waifu you’re not embarrassed to talk about? Just place her so you and your mates can chat to and see her as walking with you, anyone on this platform can see what you place!\n\nPersonal filters will also exist of course. Arachnophobics don’t want big spiders running around so they can just use a filter to find objects to hide. Time of day, weather and world changing filters could either be seen by you and you only, or you and your friends, or anyone in the vicinity!\n\nI could imagine wearing a white bodysuit, and changing my looks and outfit on the fly for everyone to see! \n\nThis is, literally changing our world. This is my dream of AR. A massive MMO-like platform with interactive objects and games placed by the community and changing your world to look different. Hopefully I won’t be too old when we see this."
9g6172,Vehicular Survival Game,"TL;DR- a 3rd person multiplayer adventure survival game that has you wandering a post-apocalyptic mars, you’ll need to find water and food. However vehicular customization replaces base building. \n\nSetting- Imagine a huge sprawling city on Mars that’s been overtaken by a desert, huge swathes of it are filled with dunes, buildings without maintenance have begun to crumble, there’s massive skyscrapers laying on their side, entire factories buried beneath the red sand, you’ll need to pick your way through abandoned  homes/apts, shopping malls, to find your water and food.\n\nObjective- Get off planet. There’s a ship on a launch pad in the center of the map, but there’s so much damage around it, not to mention it seems to be where the enemy creatures are focused, you and 15 other players need to find your way inside, fix the ship, and take off. This can be accomplished alone if your the competitive type, or you can band together and lighten the work load. \n\nEnemies- Strange beasts that seem connected to each other (not physically attached, just related), their ghostly black forms seem almost vaporous, until they sink their glowing teeth and claws into you. They take many forms, some are like small ravenous wolves that find you in the night, others are singular hulking beasts that patrol their territory, usually guarding some high grade tech. There are also strange humanoid shadows inside certain buildings at night that can only be destroyed by your flashlight so be wary when exploring in the dark. The one you really need to watch out for however is the massive black bird that passes over the city from time to time, always be wary lest you find yourself in its shadow. It will swoop down and deal massive damage to your vehicle, if it’s a bike or small walker it will most likely be wrecked and you will lose a lot of health, if your on foot, well it was nice knowing you. \n\nCombat- Not terribly direct, you’re a skilled a mechanic, not a soldier.  Your only weapon is your plasma tool, and it’s mainly used to remove parts from wrecks. But you can also use it to start a fire either to attract a large beasts attention, or to light a torch you can use to fend off the wolflike creatures. You can also use it to cut certain objects in the environment enabling you to set up traps, lure a big guy over to some fire you’ve strategically placed underneath a large strut, after you’ve cut it and the monster is in place whack it until breaks and crushes the beast. \n\nVehicular Combat- Now when your in a car that’s a whole different story, first you’ll need to find a weapon to attach to your vehicle. All weapons are energy based, they can be anything from rapid fire pulses, a plasma thrower that bathes whatever is in front of you in barely controlled plasma, to a mortar like AoE projectile capable of wiping out a whole pack of creatures. \n\nCrafting- most crafting is done via 3D printers found around the map, but some things can be made by hand, like torches, lock picks, and better backpack storage. However when your vehicle takes damage parts break, you’ll need to collect materials and bring them to the 3D printer to craft a replacement, sometimes you’ll be able to find the part you need in a wreck, but it may have already sustained damage and thus won’t be able to take as much abuse as one you printed. Your plasma tool is equipped with a scanner, it provides the information you need about whatever wreck you’re tying to fix up, but you can also use it to scan locks, this gives you a blueprint for the key which you can then go print out. \n\nScavenging- so where most survival games you need to craft almost everything you need to survive, in this many of the things necessary for survival are already available in the world. Things like tents, sleeping bags, clothing, flashlights, and other spare parts. You can craft parts for a vehicle but sometimes you can just as easily cut what you need out of another wreck. Unclaimed wrecks are kind of like treasure chests, each with one or two parts that are highlighted once your close enough. You’ll need to use your plasma tool to cut the pieces out, kind of like when you’re building a model plane and you need to pop the pieces out of that plastic frame.  You’ll also find rare tech that drastically changes the way your vehicle functions.\n\nTech- sometimes you’ll find schematics for tech that alters your vehicle. There’s Repulser tech that gets rid of your wheels and replaces them with hovering apparatuses, this gives you increased air time with some more extreme drifting. Omni-Wheel tech that allow your car to drive in any direction, allowing you to strafe and fire your weapons. Nitro tech gives your vehicle an insane boost ability that deals high damage to whatever is in your way. Jump jet tech that allows walkers increased air time. There’s also things like shields, and armor tech. Obviously not all tech is compatible with all vehicles. But all vehicles have tech worth finding. To apply the tech you’ll need to find a maintenance area in a factory. \n\nSurvival- you start off in rather tattered clothes, the more damaged your clothing the the faster your thirst will deplete as you are more exposed. You’ll want to find materials to repair the clothing or just go in search of new clothes entirely. Water can be found in sinks, fountains, or in your Rig if you’re lucky enough to have one. Food you’ll need to find in homes and shopping centers, vending machines, basically where you’d expect, you’ll need to pick some locks to get what you want though. The creatures you kill have no meat, they simply vaporize upon death. Not only does your health sustain damage when attacked, your clothes do as well. You can also sleep at any time to skip ahead, for instance if you don’t have a flashlight and it’s night time. Torches might help you see, and they help with the swarming creatures, but they won’t protect you from the humanoid shadows. You also gain a boost that reduces the amount of depletion your hunger and thirst undergoes for the next 12 game hours whenever you sleep uninterrupted. That’s right, if you pick a poor place to set up camp you can be rudely awakened to claws and teeth, or perhaps just a malevolent player who really wants your pants. \n\nStory- 16 engineers that all work for the same company find themselves stranded on Mars. They were all working on a ship, when something happened above ground. There was an earthquake (marsquake?) and then a black fog filled every room of the building. Everyone wakes up confused, they find their way outside to see a city that looks like it’s been abandoned for centuries. The ship they were building sustained heavy damage and is in need of extensive repairs, they’ll either work together or alone to gather what’s necessary for take off. They’ll need to be mindful though as a mysterious dark force now occupies their once great city. You’ll be able find snippets of information throughout the world that explain what happened. Essentially the company they worked for experimented with a substance they knew very little about in the hopes of making better rocket fuel, instead they unleashed a reality altering hive mind that’s claimed mars as its own and would really prefer it if you stayed. Like it’s not evil, it’s just lonely and doesn’t understand that when it’s assimilating people it’s getting rid of them and just making itself more alone. There’s like a final showdown type of deal where it manifests itself on the ship as your taking off and before it kills you all you explain that to it and it basically responds like “You’re blowing my mind right now dude.” Then it just leaves cause it needs to rethink its whole reason for being. \n\nCharacters- so instead of making your own character, there are sixteen characters to choose from, each with their own personalities and voice. They react to the world around them, you open a door to see a shadow beast standing in front of an open fridge like he’s trying to decide what’s for dinner and your character might give a confused “Oookay...” or a “Nope. Hard pass.” They have interactions with each other like in Overwatch when your waiting for the match to start, some know each other, others don’t. \n\nTone- As dark as it is it should be a fairly lighthearted game, think of Sunset Overdrive, but not as cartoonish. You can do custom paint jobs and put flames all over your ride, pimp it out with some fuzzy dice and shit at an abandoned garage, it’s a survival game, but it’s not constantly making things as grim as possible. Imagine life on mars being a lot like it is on earth, it just got curb stopped by some unknown entity. I feel a lot of the humor should be derived from the fact that even when things change they stay the same, i.e. satirical ads for sports drinks, movie trailers and such will be seen from to time. \n\nHere are the types of vehicles you will find. \n\nBikes- 2-4 wheeled open cockpit vehicles that specialize in speed and mobility, your increased control while in the air may be the key to reaching tech/water/food/shelter in hard to reach areas. You’ll want to turn tail and run at the first sign of danger though as you are incredibly vulnerable. Only has 2 available weapon slots. Can seat 2 people.\n\nCars- 3-4 wheeled enclosed cockpit vehicles that act as a kind of all rounder vehicle. They’re fairly quick, though not nearly as maneuverable in the air, they provide more protection from damage and the elements, and it decreases the rate at which your thirst goes down. You can also sleep inside for a safer nights sleep. Has 3 available weapon slots. Can seat 3 people.\n\nRigs- 4-8 wheeled behemoths that are armored like tanks, but move like a lazy buffalo. They have large customizable interiors that you can comfortably live in, there’s a bed, a water filtration system, a 3D printer, and little kitchen you can use to upgrade the food you eat. They can also store a smaller vehicle or tow a car behind. Has 6 weapon slots. These are some the rarer vehicles, getting them up and running will take time and considerable risk. Can seat 6 people \n\nWalker Mechs- these bipedal vehicles use legs instead of wheels and thus are capable of traversing terrain others could not pass. They vary greatly in size, ranging from small and quick open cockpit sprinters, to larger enclosed  heavy duty machinery meant for construction. The little ones have a single weapon slot, run as fast as bikes and have a jump mechanic that allows you to cover a good distance if you’re going fast enough. The larger ones have 4 weapon slots, and can bring their arms crashing down for a high damage smash attack, they are slightly slower than rigs. The larger they are the rarer. Seats 1 person\n\nElectro-Skiff- these small to mid-sized vehicles are highly specialized, they allow you to drive along any surface, even upside down, they are between bikes and cars speed-wise, and have a strong drift to them whenever you change direction abruptly. There are no weapon slots on skiffs, they are primarily for reaching places you could not get to otherwise, either for the tech that may be hidden there or you just need a safe place. Imagine one of those landspeed record cars, but floating in tendrils of electricity.  Seats 1 person.\n\nThat’s pretty much it. \n\n\n\n"

9kvp55,Randomly Generated Murder Mysteries,"So I've recently been toying with an idea, getting a feel for the feasibility and actual fun of it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe game idea is that you play a detective in an open world city. Every so often a new murder case comes in to your office, which you must solve entirely on your own merit. You investigate a crime scene, performing the key forensic techniques you might expect from a typical detective game, but performed as a much more sandbox experience. You can check any/every item for fingerprints or trace fibres, which can then be analysed further. You can inspect and investigate any part of the city if you think their may be evidence there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese key player abilities could include:\n\n* Forensic chemistry, identifying materials and toxicology, the composition of poisons and substances.\n* Searching through criminal records, fingerprint data, affiliations.\n* Analysing bloodstain patterns, determining cause of death, possible instruments used.\n* Digital forensics, browsing a victim's phone, recovering corrupt/deleted data\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs the title says, murders are randomly generated. Their location, motive and chosen weapon. These should be able to be deducted from viewing the crime scene and the surrounding areas, as well as interviewing anyone that may be of use. This then (in theory) can lead to a small list of suspects. You can imagine an NPC be responsible for more than one murder, or may be affiliated with other criminals, helping you to solve more cases.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe goal is to alleviate some of the issues that some modern detective games face, particularly the ones highlighted in Mark Brown's [What Makes a Good Detective Game?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwV_mA2cv_0) video. A degree of open ended-ness is crucial to the sandbox nature of the idea. You are either right in your deductions, or falsely accuse someone. Maybe you make enemies, maybe you become the laughing stock of the department.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease let me know your thoughts on this. It's listed as abstract because I imagine a generator like this to be pretty complex in order to make a murder mystery that plays coherently enough to be deductible and interesting. Nevertheless it could turn out to be valid enough for a video game."

Or an Aussie blonde female s.w.a.t officer?\n\n2) a female Korean martial arts singer with a dragon spirit bo staff? Or a Korean female spec op commando with military arts?\n\n3) a demon possessed scarecrow from the south in the U.S? Or a possessed ancient Japanese scarecrow like a Kuebiko?\n\n4) for my fire breathing dancing EDC clown girl, is it better she joined a secret modern ninja clan learning to fight and using her fire skills? Or joined some fire worshipping fighting cult lead by a fire demon?"
9kv0jo,"A retro JRPG game, except challengers take you into microgame battles.","Think of it like playing Pokémon Red/Blue, except the challenger screens transition into WarioWare 1-on-1 microgames or like 2D Mario Party battles.\n\nThe ""microbattles"" are under insane, senseless scenarios. And they only get more nonsensical as the game progresses. Early microbattles might be:\n\n* **Reflex Rock, Paper Scissors** - Where one player throws out a hand and the other player has a split second to throw out the hand that would beat it. They take turns serving.\n* **Log Chopping** - You just race at chopping a log. You're just angling your strikes to chop bigger chunks. But, like... you're in an office for some reason.\n\nSoon they devolve into carrying ever-larger stacks of books across a moat, doing donuts on stolen tricycles, abducting cows in flying saucers, and seeing who can chant spells from the Necronomicon to raise their dead the fastest. The main plot of the story is delivered deadpan serious, however."

9ksddu,Claustrophobic orror exploration game,"So I was recently browsing for some games on steam and I thought of a game myself. Maybe this game exists? I spent some time on steam but didn't find anything similar. So the game idea is simple: You're in a very small underwater submarine, with 3 monitors and a few peeking windows. Everything is dark except for the monitors lighting up your interior. You're exploring around the sea floor to find salvages that have food or materials to fix your submarine. But also, when you're exploring there could be big deep-sea creatures that attack you. Imagine cruising around, lights off to save energy, and you hear a strange roar. You look around the windows, nothing, but then you see eyes in the back window and you floor it, screaming at the top of your lungs. I'd love something like that, what do you think about it?\n\nImage to give you a better idea of the submarine: [https://imgur.com/a/jJOidZS](https://imgur.com/a/jJOidZS)"
9kqzuf,Need a game idea to bring to my school exam,"So the game has to be SFW (obviously) and preferably has something to do with school subjects like history, IT, maths, Italian literature (because i live in Italy), etc... \n\nThanks in advance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;"
9kpthe,MMORPG in a persistent world where player actions have actual meaning and consequences.,"**Preface**\n---\n\nI love RPGs and I love multiplayer, so you'd think I would be a big fan of MMORPGs.\n\nBut I have no fun in them whatsoever, I've tried many times, WoW, Elder Scrolls Online, EVE etc.\n\n\n\n\nAnd I can narrow it down to one specific thing:\n\n\nI used to play an MMO called City of Heroes, for the unaware it was an mmo where you created a superhero, roamed the city to fight bad guys.\nOn the surface, it was my perfect game. I'm a big superhero fan, and this was an RPG too!\nI played for several months, not really loving much beyond the character creator but still playing none the less.\n\nI take on a mission to stop a villain, I grind through the mission and get to the 'big bad' of this story. He cackles, ""you will never defeat me"", I get ready to fight when suddenly another player charges in and very quickly kills the boss without my help.\n\nA few seconds later, the boss re-spawns; he cackles ""you will never defeat me"".\n\nAnd that was the last time I played City of Heroes; the immersion was shattered completely. The bosses just sprung back to life once they'd been stopped, my actions meant nothing to the story. In my eyes, it was 'multiplayer' only in the sense that I could see other players also playing the same single-player story in my eyes.\n\nThe same failure for immersion happened the multiple times I've tried to play WoW, my actions feel like a pointless grind, the story and lore merely background.\n\n---\n\n**The Idea**\n---\n\nAn MMORPG where every player's actions have a permanent consequence. Killing an NPC means that NPC is dead for good (*excluding perhaps necromancy if it's a fantasy setting*).\n\nCompleting a quest, means that quest is done, no other player can do it because it's no longer required.\n\nAs such this is obviously a ridiculously large scaled project, where everything would need to procedural to ensure there's a constant flow of content.\n\nAnd of course, expansions/dlc/updates would need to be heavily story-based because they need to keep the players invested not in the grind but in the world itself.\n\nNow, that said, there is still a place for 'raid bosses', it can be totally reasonable to have dungeons where the story 'repeats' itself for high level players to continually try harder and harder raids.\nBut the overall world would continue to change and evolve.\n\n---\n\n**TL/DR:**\n---\nAn mmorpg where the story and quests continue based on player actions, player choices matter not just for their story but every players."
9kmgnz,Fitbit Fueled Merchant Trading Game,"A merchant trading game much like ""This Merchant Life."" I haven't played that game but it looks like what I'm thinking of.  No battles or anything. Just walking from town to town and seeing what is for sale there. Then walking to the next town to see what it sells for and buy other stuff. \n\nThere are certain number of steps required to reach a town. You choose the town you wish to go to from the map. The goods vary from town to town and the farther away goods come from the more they raise in value. You wouldn't even need to show a town. Simply a menu of what is for sale and what the goods in your inventory sell for there. \n\nThere will be a strategy between hanging onto your goods to take to the next town for a higher price or to buy higher priced goods that will increase in value even more.  \n\nThere is a year, month, and weekly leader board. The board can list friends only as well as everyone playing.\n\n**Extras...**\n\nSteps taken once you reach your town are only worth half toward going to the next town. This will keep people from saving up steps to make a bunch of trades before the week/month end to jump on the leader boards. We have people do that at work on our Fitbit challenges. They don't sync their Fitbit until late in the challenge so they are not contenders others try to be beat. \n\nOf course there is a limit to what you can hold but maybe you can hold a bit more for a loss in steps needed to reach the next town. This would add to the strategy side of it as well. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWould someone please make this game. I would pay 15-20 bucks right now for something like this."
9km7ot,VR Space Ship Game,"I've never posted before but have been following gameideas for some time now. I have quite a number of game ideas that I would love to play. I've been sitting on them hoping to one day have the know how to produce them. Since that will more than likely never happen, I decided to start sharing them. \n\nI've been reading a lot of Larry Niven lately and was thinking about what it would be like to be in all that space but stuck in such a small environment. Since I love a good story, I think this should really follow a good story line.\n\n**Summary** \n\nVR Game where you are in a space ship in a deep sleep for many years. The computer wakes you because of some event or another and you need to deal with the issue before returning to sleep. \n\nEach event is different from the last, some have crucial time limits (ie. running out of air). Could be stuff like the following…\n\npuzzle (trying to solve a problem with items in hand… thinking Apollo 13) \n\n(solving an issue with the electrical circuits on board) \n\n(re-plotting your path… puzzle with plotting trajectories) \n\n(Simon type game where your computer gives you a pattern that you need to repeat)\n\ntime management (think Diner Dash but with the ships controls or tending various plants coming around a conveyor)\n\naction, (shooting asteroids before they hit you) \n\npiloting (flying through an asteroid field)\n\nMisc. (spacewalk to fix something outside the ship) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCould have an elevator that goes between rooms. Always opens behind you so you have to turn around to walk back into the same play area. Trying to drive home that the play area IS the entire environment. \n\nThe focus being that you are stuck in this small space with limited resources. All the while being able to look out the windows at beautiful space scenes. \n\n**Story Outline**\n\nRussia is upset that they have been beat getting man on the moon. They decide to be the first to another planet. Entire ship is 70/80's tech. The astronaut spends time in a deep sleep between events. You are to land and setup landing facilities for a ship that will be a few years behind you with many others. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTutorial is a training camp before the flight. You board the flight and fall asleep as the launch count down starts. The games starts in space many years later with the first time the onboard computer wakes you to solve an issue. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter 100's of years spent in deep sleep, you are intercepted by a space ship as you near the target planet. You think they are aliens but they speaking your language. They see you as invaders but you insist that you are from Earth. They say they are from Earth as well and don't believe you. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurns out that ten years after you departed Earth, they developed a way to LOS (Line Of Sight) travel. Basically if you can see the location you can be instantly transported there. This eliminated the need for space ships. Since there was no way for your ship to turn around, they removed the exploration trip from the history books and let you travel on your way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally after much questioning… maybe puzzles (put several countries in their proper locations on a globe as proof that you are from earth), they do a search of Earth records and discover that there was in fact an exploration trip sent 100's of years ago. However, since you don’t have the proper papers, you are imprisoned and again stuck in your play area for several more levels of puzzles.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou are sent instantly back to Earth with LOS travel and once again put in jail until they can get you the proper papers to live in this new century. You are given ""assessments"" to determine where you should live/work. This could be any number of levels… \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTurns out you had a few dollars in a retirement account that is now worth billions. The game ends with you sitting on a porch looking out over the vast farm you purchased and the credits roll.\n\n&amp;#x200B;"
9kkie1,A 2D platforming game without gravity.,"All hell breaks loose when someone accidentally destroys the artificial gravity pump in your space superstation.\n\nThe game starts off as a goofy platformer except there is no ""up"" so to speak. The world and map rotates freely around the player. At first you're fairly limited: you could only grab onto and jump off of ladders, handholds and ropes. Later you'll get magnet boots to stick to metal surfaces and fire extinguishers to propel yourself for limited bursts.\n\nBy the end, you'll be equipped to the gills and able to expertly zip around the labyrinthian superstation.\n\n****\n\nAgain, it starts off pretty goofy. The superstation is mostly run by ineffective robots that can't handle zero gravity. The Claptrap-like robots will need your rescuing. Things take a turn for the sinister when some of them begin to malfunction and act hostile (like the AI in Portal's turrets) and you find evidence that the gravity pump failure wasn't an accident. You suspect one of the other human crewmembers might be a saboteur.\n\nAlthough some robots become hostile, it's not really for *combat.* They're more like hazards in the same way turrets are in Portal. The game is a exploration platformer through and through. It's like if Super Metroid was set in a space station full of dopey NPCs and the biggest challenge was just getting around."
