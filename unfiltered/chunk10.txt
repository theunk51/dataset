jlbbv9,Strategy game based on social influence,"The basic gist of it is you are a part of a control group for a zombie disease. You have to keep the general public uninformed to prevent chaos. You could hire a popular influencer (YouTube, Instagram, etc.) to tell people not to go there for some reason or another. You could also create negative reviews to keep people out, you make a basic template and an AI creates more based on that. You get funds from the government depending on how well your method worked. You could use this money to hire more popular influencers or upgrade your AI."
jlb5yv,RTS where units are more autonomous and there is less emphasis on clicking speed or micromanaging,"There would be more ways to layer commands after each other beyond the usual shift click. \n\nFor example if you place a building, it will recruit nearby villagers unless you set them to avoid building. \n\nThe default right click behavior is action or join. So if you set a villager to harvest a resource, they will be grouped with the other villagers harvesting that specific pile. The alternate action is to move unjoined. You can always double click to select that individual unit.\n\nMove and attack is always the default for military units instead of move.\n\nUnits automatically group with other units of the same type, and military unit groups join into army groups.\n\nYou can set patrol paths for military units [as in many RTS's] but you can assign new units to that patrol path easily. The patrol path remains if all the units died so you can return to the patrol path if you retake that area.\n\nAll military buildings have a basic ranged attack.\n\nProduction queues are endless and can be managed for multiple buildings at once. Units can be given orders before they spawn."
jl7iei,4 player co-op dungeon game where each player has it's own tool/ability.,"Thought of a top down 4 player co-op dungeon crawler where each player has it's own tool / item / weapon. One player has a sword, another a shield, the third one a bow and the fourth a hookshot, and then they have to work together to take out various enemies.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI could make this right now! if only I had any experience with networking..."
jl6mqj,Celebrity game,"Since everyone wants to be connected with the character that they play with in a game. This could be done by putting every celebrity in a game. This makes the players more connected to the game and it could bring up a bunch of opportunities. Finally, this community is great! Keep doing what ur doing!"
jl6d5h,A VR space sim but it's really a buttons and switches simulator,"Ever since Star Wars Squadron came out I keep thinking about the scenes in the movies where someone is dogfighting but also flipping switches while pulling g's. There are some games like this but you need to learn a text book worth of stuff before using it. My idea is the switches and buttons will flash when you need to hit them. They will be divided into regions for shields or engines or weapons. When one needs reloading or repair or more energy, the buttons will light up and you just need to hit them. Taking damage would require more buttons and switches to be flipped.\n\nThis all happens in VR so one hand for maneuvering and firing and the other hand for pressing buttons :D\n\nI haven't thought too hard on this, so any suggestions would be welcomed!"
jl6b2m,Make Firefighting Game Fun?,"Hi, idk if this is where I’m supposed to post a question like this or anything, if I need to take it down please lmk, but I’ve always been interested in making a firefighting game. I’ve tried multiple times on ue4 but i keep running into the same problem: fighting fires isn’t fun. It’s just point and hold down mouse then wait. Does anyone have ideas on making a (semi) realistic firefighting game actually fun? Thanks in advance hope to hear some cool ideas :D"
jl4f20,"A survival game, but it revolves around your journal","So I was watching videos of survival games and journaling tips and such, just because, and I remembered this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/jitba3/a\_survival\_game\_where\_you\_name\_everything/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/jitba3/a_survival_game_where_you_name_everything/)\n\nCombining all of these, I came up with this idea:\n\nLike any other survival game, but you have a journal that you used to, well, journal, prior to the crash, accident etc. After the events that brought you to survival, you use the remaining pages of your journal for survival AKA taking notes, making discoveries, writing down crafting ideas or any survival ideas, your condition and so on.\n\nThe game would start with one of multiple reasons you're here e.g. plane, car, train, ship. After that, the equipment you'll have is like 1 or 2 minimal survival equipment, which is randomized, but every game you'll always have your journal. As you start, there's already some survival notes written in it, as in you scribbled some quick thoughts into it that may help your survival (a kind of a tutorial). As your progress through the game, the journal will fill with notes of various things: from crafting recipes to thoughts, that hint to some thing that could progress the game. Every games journal in different, as you experience and find new and different things, so will the journal fill with notes differently; to get two same journals is pretty rare.\n\nThe ultimate goal altogether is to survive and come out alive.\n\nBut I mentioned that you'll use the last pages of journal; that's because 2/3 of it is filled with thought and entries that could portray the kind of person the character is you play as. But it isn't always the same. It's always different for every game (as ""always"" goes with games). One or a team is not enough to write enough entries, so people who have bought the game could go on the game's website, prove their purchase and are permitted to a page, where you and other people can write stories, then comment and vote for them. by the end of the month, the most voted story is implemented into the game. A moderation team is in place to disqualify stories that could be described as, *""very, very wrong""*"
jkxt48,An MMO where player actions affect the game (to put it in simplest terms),"So I've had this idea bouncing around in my head for a while, figured I'd post it here for anyone interested in actually making it (I have absolutely no experience in game design, my thing is screenwriting)\n\n-The basic premises is you have three factions fighting a galactic war: Humanity, the aliens they have been fighting for nearly 2 decades, and a group comprised of defectors from both sides determined to end the war at any cost.\n\n-The ""war front"" can be affect by player actions, either through PVP, PVE or a combo of both, pushing each faction from star systems to unlock PVE opportunities for the conquering faction. Each faction would have to be cautious how far they push, however, as once they have a certain number of systems captured random spawns in the form of supply convoys would pop up that the enemy faction could attack and destroy, applying a debuff faction wide that reduces damage, armor, and increases repair times.\n\n-Ships come in various shapes and sizes and are able to be built by the player in their factions core worlds (and possibly in their clan/guild/fleet headquarters, more on that momentarily). The player can swap out armor, weapons, and shields, and, if possible, choose their own ship interiors to walk around in. There is potential to either follow the EVE Online's example and make the ships actually disappear when lost in combat, or Star Trek Onlines example where a ship is simply damaged when destroyed.\n\n-Guilds/fleets/clans (whatever you want to call them) would have their own star system and/or station to call home. They could either flag it PVP or PVE, and if flagged PVP other players could assault their station/star system and raid it for supplies, opening up opportunities for PVP and wars between guilds on top of the galactic war.\n\n-Now for the hardest part of all this to implement: Ground combat. You see, in envision this game giving each player two toons: Their ship captain, and their ground forces commander; each can be leveled to learn new skills/get better equipment, which in turn affects how they perform in combat. On top of that, the ground forces commander brings a compliment of troops with them (can ether be a single unit or several units, though the next idea works best with multiple units. I am going to continue assuming multiple units) that they can deploy onto the battlefield to either assault enemy positions or defend their own. This has to potential to include tanks, APC's and air cover provided by the fleet in orbit, as well as infantry that can be chosen to either compliment or counter those (think anti-tank armed infantry). Also, when I say deploy I really mean that: players would be able to place infantry under their command into covered positions/buildings, and order tanks take up positions where ever they choose.\n\nI have more ideas, but those are the four main ones!"
jktehy,Multiplayer game scaling with playerbase,"The core idea of mine is a multiplayer game that scales with the player Base.\nI'm imagining a small camp centered on some kind of safe spot at the beginning. The goal of the players is to kill the weak creatures in the vicinity, gather resources and build up defences.\nSo far pretty basic.\nThe scaling is done via a ranking system. The top player/players are allowed to change something about the settlement or their character. Like create a new settlement, create a skill that helps fighting monsters, or anything else reasonable that they come up with. Or maybe they can just choose from a list of things that are possible to implement. \nThe devs then will implement the idea in a patch. \n\nSo the scaling is done via a direct communication of the top players with the games developers which is natural because the top players tend to be the ones most invested in the game, if the ranking system is done well.\n\nSo as time goes on and more and more players join the game, the 'safe' world would get bigger and bigger. For newcomers it would start out as a normal rpg where they develop skills. The top players would experience new challenges prepared by the devs. \n\nIf the community shrinks again, monsters would overcome the defences but get weakened as they come to the center, the safe world shrinks and ruins are left behind."
jklcww,A military game that changes based on the player's rank,"Here's what I mean. The game is a huge open war. When the game starts out, you're just a private and the game is a first person shooter similar to Call of Duty where all you do is follow orders and move to the next objective. As you level up, your rank increases. When you become a sergeant, the game switches to a squad based third person shooter like Mass Effect where you have to lead a small squad through the objectives. As a lieutenant or captain, the game becomes a top down real time squad combat game where you control a dozen or so soldiers and lead them through their missions. As a lieutenant colonel or colonel, it's a base building RTS like starcraft where you control an entire base of soldiers, construct buildings, and fight that way. As a general it's like a high warfare game like hearts of iron. You can make it all the way to the leader of your country where you decide the policy on a strategic scale.\n\nThoughts?"
jkhav9,Drunk Driving Simulator,"OVERVIEW:\nTaking the idea of Beer Goggles, this game would be a safe and educational experience of what driving under the influence would be like. \n\nPlayers would start at a virtual bar with four types of dinks in front of them, each representing a difficulty setting:\n\n- Water: Tutorial/Practice, lets the player get used to the controls and how the game operates. Would always be the same track no matter what and nothing would hinder them. \n- Beer: Easy, vision is blurred slightly and may dilate focus. \n- Wine: Medium, vision is blurred even more and audio is muffled a bit. May have a tendency of fading in and out. \n- Whiskey: Hard, vision is practically gone and nothing besides a few quiet echos from outside can be heard. The player’s character might also vomit at times, further hindering vision. \n\nThe player would the select the difficulty by “drinking” (as in doing the motion of drinking the contents) and would fade to black. They would then be in the car to drive home and must do so in the quickest yet safest way possible without damaging their car, crashing into other vehicles, stationary objects or pedestrians. Each one putting a penalty onto the player’s score. The game ends when they reach their destination, total their vehicle or cause a vehicular manslaughter. \n\nFEATURES:\n- Drink theme difficulty. See above. \n- Custom difficulty: if the player wants to, they can grab a cocktail mixer which gives them access to different setting in the form of alcoholic drink that they can mix together, from how blurry their vision is, if they vomit or not, chance of blacking out, etc. When they’re satisfied, they can “shake” the mixture and pour it into a cocktail glass. They can “drink” the mixed cocktail and thus play the game with those settings. \n- Specific Versions: I would like to see different versions of the game made for specific players:\n  - Normal mode: for the average person, contains blood, injury and copyrighted material. \n  - Streamer mode: for those who record and stream. Same as Normal mode but without the blood, injury and copyright stuff. \n  - Educational mode: designed for schools and driver training classes. Everything is replaced to look like a crash test site, including pedestrians. Instructors using this would also have access to change the difficulty remotely instead of a bar and can monitor/record the data from a students run. \n- Theater mode: after a player’s run, they can go back and watch an unaltered replay of their run, with or without the hinderances from the difficulty they chose. \n- Multiple tracks: each run wouldn’t be the same as it some may just memorize the rout and defeat the purpose of the game being a simulator. Thus a random set of built in courses would shuffle through each time a new run starts. If the player makes it through a course, then that course can be unlocked to play it again to try and beat their score.\n- Weed difficulty: (OPTIONAL) another difficulty setting would be “smoking” a blunt. This would cause the player’s vision to become slow and bright, like they just got hit with a flash bang grenade, and audio would be a constant echo."

jk3skl,God's and monsters,"So I got this idea from a dream that I had: you start on an island and you have a timer, and in that timer you have to explore the island that is full of monsters and gather weapons,armor , food, and water... When the timer is over, the tournament of the gods begin , and you keep getting teleported to an arena every 5 minutes to fight with other people. But during your time on the island there's special events, like the one in my dream where a big whale appears when it's might time and you can only see it's silhouette as it's blocking the moon and when it's morning , the whale splashes the water and creates monstrous tsunami's and you have like 1 hour to find a way to protect yourself or save the island. In my dream I escaped them by building a staircase of sand to the sky, so I guess it has Minecraft like mechanics where certain material can float , but I remember them not being cubes and being more like how in subnautica the terrain is . Also you can try to get the god's favor by getting really far in the tournament which would make you protected against these special events , but you can still die from monsters on the island. \nAnd that's basically it , I don't have an ending , but in my dream I was on the island with three other people: me (I was fighting in the arena for most of the game) , a woman (she was like the leader) and another male ( which was useless and always scared ) and my dream ended after we started building a bridge of sand to the sky to go over the tsunami by the whale, but I remember when building the bridge it looked like a cutscenes.( As we started to build the bridge we started climbing up and then the camera starts moving upwards showing the whale and then it stops."
jk2n8h,Looking for game ideas for Card based games,"I'm looking for a more out of the box kind of ideas for card games, something more than the regular 1vs1 PVP like heartstone o similar games.\n\nI like the idea of using cards for abstraction as in  Fights in Tight Spaces"
jjzy0n,An RPG Where You Play As The Dungeon Boss,"OVERVIEW:\nWhat makes a good hero isn’t their looks, skills or equipment, but the villains they’ve beaten. But how do these villains come about? Simple, they become a Dungeon Boss. \n\nIn this game, the fantasy world has less villains in it, just enough that knew problems are springing up for everyone and drastically changing the status quo in the worst way possible. To help fix this, an Imp from Hell who runs a bank offers you a once in a lifetime loan to become a Dungeon Boss. From their, the player can build and upgrade their dungeon, place traps, add loot and secret passages, place mini bosses and tests of endurances for heroes foolish enough to attempt it. At the same time, the player can send out raiding parties to villages, town and cities or lead them to gather more supplies, loot or to capture and place them under their banner. \n\nFEATURES:\n- Race: at the beginning, the player can choose to be one of several different monster species or humanoid race, each with their own pros and cons.\n- Locations: After choosing, the player’s dungeon is placed at a location based on what race they chosen. This, of course, can be changed with a small fee and significant Dungeon Level\n- Dungeon Level: As the player builds and upgrades their dungeon, their Dungeon Level will increase, allowing access to more room types and upgrades. This also will attract more adventures to explore it as well as minions who’d want to join. \n- Towns &amp; Raids: To gain more infamy, loot and supplies, the player will have to raid towns and villages. Each town would be listed with different indicators from how big it is, how well protected it is and the quality of loot they possibly have. When the player starts a raid, they will only have a few minutes to go through and pillage the place, fighting back armies, guards and armed civilians. They can enter people’s homes and steal or force the residents to give the player their goods. They would have a few seconds though in each home and once they leave the place, it’s sealed off for the rest or the raid.\n- Heroes &amp; Dungeon Crawlers: Part of the main game is having adventures discover the player’s dungeon and explore it. If one or a party does, the player can use traps and minions to slow them down or weaken them before they get to the final boss battle. If they defeat the player, the loot is restocked with what is in their reserves, the dungeon is given a rating along with the player and they are revived at the cost of their gold. But if the player defeats the heroes or they fail in the dungeon; same thing as far as ranking is concerned, but the player would gain loot, infamy and can choose to let the heroes live, execute them or try and convert them to become a minion."
jjyyze,Need Game Ideas!,"Hi, \n\nI just started learning game development. Do you guys have a idea for a multiplayer or single player game that's addicting, easy to make, yet fun game. \n\nThanks"
jjx65t,Iv been having nightmares recently and from what iv learned from them as a writer etc these seem like some fun rules for a game. I’m using them in my scripts but for a game it’s nice too.,"You have to remain still and not make a sound when they are around at night but still be on the move, the more in the area there are, you’ll eventually be surrounded. \n\nYou can’t ask for help while they are near or you’ll be found \n\nElectronics don’t work when in hiding \n\nIf touched you become one and during the day you won’t know who’s one already ( they seem as if though fine, never touched and on the move with you, till dark ) \n\nOne can sacrifice themselves to save the others in the moment if the groups at risk of being found as long as they distract and the others are not revealed, though you’ll hear the sounds still. Remaining quite and stone faced through it all is key, not even a tear."
jjwifq,The Thing (Among Us and Jason games like),"Seriously, think about it.\n\n10 to 12 people minimum in a base (doesn't have to be maps based on the movies), 20 at most. Around 10 to 15 minutes in, someone gets assimilated by The Thing. But just cause they are assimilated, doesn't mean they stop playing, now they have to look for a way off the base without alerting the others.\n\nThere are weapons, but only a few people can use them at a time (if everyone is allowed to use a weapon, then it will make the game less interesting), and they are limited - like 4 flame throwers and a couple axes. \n\nOnce all traces of The Thing are eliminated, then the game is won by the Survivors. If everyone is infected or killed, then The Thing wins. After every game session, it is show who was infected/assimilated/killed in what order, just to show if their guesses were right or wrong. \n\nNow if an infected or survivor is killed, then that player becomes a spectator until the game ends. \n\nThe testing an equipping of weapons becomes accessible when someone is infected, and the infected person always happens after the session starts (Unlike Among US - no one starts as the Thing, they have to become the Thing). \n\nThis game would of course be primarily focused as a Multiplayer game since it can't be played alone (unless a singleplayer is done where its one player among AI controlled characters, but I doubt that would be interesting). And the maps would have to be big, with plenty of hiding spots for both Infected and Survivor. \n\nI think a game like this would be really fun. What do you think?"

jjkzdr,A virtual pet game where you put other virtual pets into worker camps to harvest resources you need to pamper your favorite virtual pet,"So I'm thinking supper cute and toony graphics with very dark humor\n\nGoal is to breed the best, most majestic, most adorable virtual pet. \n\nBut to do this you need to build breeding and training facilities. You need toys and food and clothes and items of comfort. All this requires workers to build. And resources to harvest which requires more workers.\n\nHow do you get workers? By enslaving your less than impressive virtual pets. Put them in the mines. Or send them to logger camps.\nNeed clothes? Better get some sweatshops going.\n\n Don't forget you need test subjects for the performance enhancers and make up you're producing.\n\nEach of these jobs will allow the user to physically see their adorable and player bred virtual pets slaving away looking sad and tired and dirty.\n\nGenetics will also play a role in what your best virtual pets features will be. Through breeding you'll be able to perfect your chosen pet's color patterns, shapes, and abilities. \n\nYou'll have to have patience and hand select suitors to get the perfect genes. Separate the winners at birth and send the rest to work. Or the incinerators if you don't need more labourers\n\nPlayers can compete globally in mini games that test your virtual pets abilities and beauty. There would be a photo mode too so you can share your perfect breed to the world."

As the enemies can come back into the fight if you don’t capture them but maybe they can still get exhausted or too scared to fight.\n\n\n**Quick RTS example:**\n\nGame modes can include:\n* Capture the flag/hill\n* Route and or capture all enemies\n\nUnit types vs medieval type:\n\nLight infantry: Civilians\nArchers: Protestors\nHeavy infantry: Riot police\nWar elephant: Water cannon vehicle"

jjf3t5,"A strategic and tactical NFL game, but without controller the players","So... I'm not big on NFL, I don't understand the game a whole lot. I get the gist of it. What strikes me as the most interesting aspect of the game, isn't less the brilliance of individual players, but more the tactical use of plays. Picking from your teams play book, the defensive and offensive plays to use, based on your opponents line-up etc.\n\nMadden is fine. But I don't want to play as the guys, I suck at that and I'm not too interested.\n\nSo, a game that allows you to make those tactical decisions would be great. Obviously there needs to be more to it though:\n\n1. You're the head coach, so you would get advice from the quaterback on the field and your other coaches\n2. You have pre-set plays, but you can also come up with your own outside of a specific match. You would have a limit to how many plays you can have in the playbook (because players can't remember too many)\n3. You're also making strategic decisions on which players to recruit / transfer / pick etc\n\nI guess it's like Football Manager for NFL, but a little more involved during a match.\n\nI think there may need to be some changes to some of the rules etc. So for example, maybe the offense picks their play first, and then the defense can see their line-up before picking their own play. Maybe audibles don't exist, or limited in some way.\n\nThere could also be quite a lot more involvement during the match as well. For example, every time the ball is caught, or fumbled, it pauses and allows both players to adjust their teams movements to some limited degree."

jbxl15,I want to know if the concept of my Survival Horror game is good,"In the rift, You start out as a 10 year old kid who is living at his house. One night, Everyone vanishes and he’s in another dimension where a handful of monsters randomly attack. You start out in your house and front yard, and you need to survive there. You have hunger, Thirst, Energy and Sanity. If you survive long enough, You’ll age up. (It should take about 14 days in game) and as you age, You’ll unlock more areas and skills (for example when you’re 11 you’ll be able to drive a car and go through the whole game’s map). So while you age, You need to get food, Water, and sleep. But it’s not that easy. Randomly in the game there will be monsters that attck you for a period of time. Here’s a list of the ones I’ve planned out:\n\nThe first is No head. He will appear late on your first night. He’ll chase you and try to swipe you with his floating hands. All you need to do is run from him and he’ll go away.\n\nNext is the sleeper which you’ll encounter about 4-7 days after you start. He will kill you in your sleep if you pass out from no energy. \n\nNext is The Hanging Tree, Which is always just outside your front yard. Once you get out of your front yard, Theres a chance that you’ll hallucinate of a hanged kid which will drain your sanity. (Once you’re out of that, You’re dead).\n\nThen There’s the Lost Episode which may turn on randomly on the TV in your house or your phone. It’s a disturbing video which drains your sanity like the hanging tree but this one lures you towards it. \n\nFinally theres the radio song. If you’re low on sanity, You can cry which has a chance to lure monsters but replenishes your sanity. (There are better ways to do this later) If you loose too much sanity and cry for too long, The radio will play some Cheerful Music that slowly gets more and more demented until it hurts your ears to listen too and makes you tired (I had too many sanity ones)\n\nThat’s my game summarized. Is it a good idea or should I change some things?"
jbxkdj,The Lord/Lady Will See You Now,"I was thinking of a kind of resource management game where you oversee the mansion of an Elder God or similar vile being and you have to not only keep the servants in line and the place spotless but also have to clean up bodies and ""evidence"" before authorities come around looking, have to assassinate smaller nuisances such as mindless zombies or would be usurpers to your Lord or Lady's seat of power, make sure there are always enough cultists supplying sacrifices and repelling those who would try to keep your Lord or Lady's foothold in the waking realm at bay...\n\nI guess I've found my Halloween mood heh."
jbxbvj,Pocket Dimension Monsters : The Revolt," *I hope the satyr is obvious.*\n\nSo you and your kind have been captured for generations by devilish entities that use devices that compel you to battle one another. They subject you to carrot and stick tactics in order to ""train you"". But one day, your ""master"" forgets to put you back in your Genie Cube and you are able to escape. Now you go about the world trying to free your kindred pocket dimension monsters (or Dimons). \n\nI was thinking that this game could be a rpg or it could be a platformer and you can choose different Dimons to play as you free them from their masters, having different powers. \n\nThinking about this idea almost makes me want to make it myself now lol\n\nBut satyr or not I'd probably get sued :D"

You can to time travel between timeline to see each affect it has on the future. \n\nEnemy types\n\nEnemy type will differ for each time line. Industrial Age will have mostly have humans. Present will have technologically advanced weapons(robots, drones, guns). Cyberpunk future will have a lot of robots. Post apocalypse will have mutants, old robots. \n\nMechanics/players ability\n\nI am thinking FPS with ability to control time. Mark various location using wrist watch and teleport to these locations on watch for fighting advantage. Can craft weapons(bombs,guns and sword) that will slowdown enemies. Other weapon includes drones, invisibility cloak, climbing tools, zip lines and etc.\nMaterials crafted or received in future timeline cannot be used in past.

jbdcqz,Bucket simulator - Make a bucket transcend reality,"What if you just controlled a bucket near the Manhattan bridge? You could have three classes that you can switch between at a bucket workshop. The bucket simulator would basically be Untitled Goose Game with different physics, objectives, and setting(s).\n\nThe first class would be the wooden bucket. The wooden bucket is a thicker, older fashioned bucket designed to cause chaos and physical destruction. It can break glass so you can access different areas and it can (and will) end up over someone's head. Mostly, it creating access to blocked areas and causing deaths involving car crashes and manslaughter.\n\nThe second class would be the metal bucket. This one is a sleeker, more modern type of bucket; thinner and smaller overall but more helpful around the city. This bucket can be filled with water, grow plants, and can pick locks. Overall, the metal bucket is used to complete more complicated tasks such as watering plants, picking locks to unlock different areas and content, and distract people with its glamour and pouring acid down their throats.\n\nThe final class would be the gemstone bucket. The gemstone bucket will be able to generally solve puzzles and trap people. This bucket has the ability to reflect light, which can speed up plant growth. It can also become sharpened to cut locks and legs off of their respective attached areas. The most useful thing it can do is that it will not break, helping solve weight and/or tension puzzles as well as make people get stuck in their building.\n\nI am too lazy to actually expand on this idea more, so you guys take it from here. Let me know your questions and suggestions. Feel free to make this game yourself. Thank you!"
jbcnhy,Open world 2x Predators vs 10x Humans hardcore VR Escape Battle Royale,"The plot: Two teams of players aboard choppers fly to an island where they lost contact with a previous team and outpost. Upon reaching the island both choppers are shot down by a mysterious object and land apart from each other. 5 players per chopper, some random injuries occur in the beginning which must be dealt with. The goal is to reach the outpost and get to the escape chopper while being hunted by two player controlled predators. \n\nMechanics:\n\nPredators: All the stuff from the movies, thermal vision, disc, shoulder cannon, spear, wrist blade. The predators uses taunts and noises against players and can also hear players voice coms if they are within range and also record small samples of target players voice to playback as a taunt like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIKUGF5fdmc . The predators spawn in the middle of the map and every two minutes their ship scans the island revealing where the players are for 5 seconds. The predators make their way towards the revealed players and try to intercept them on their path to the exit. Predators have huge amounts of HP, regenerate HP, and also limited healing supplies. When a predator is low on HP during an encounter they can cloak to escape. If a predator dies they can respawn after a 5 minute timer and start back in the middle. The predator has a small rocket/kite they can call every 5 minutes to fast travel a small distance to catch up to or intercept humans. The rocket is visible to human players and can be shot down if seen. When on the rocket the predator flies over the tree tops. Predators will kill players in 1-3 hits depending on weapon of choice. Some hits may maim human players such as fracture or complete amputation of limbs. Since the game is in VR the predator can impale a human and fling them around as they want.\n\nHumans: Humans spawn at two random helicopter locations. 1-2 players start with an injury so the other players need to help them by foraging a splint or tourniquet before beginning. The players have a map and compass and must use it to find the extract point. The extract point is randomly generated and is a science facility with a helicopter. Players start with a random loadout and each character has varying HP with starting 75-150hp and varying move speeds. Ammo supply is limited on each character so spray and pray is never advisable. Players can find random ammo and guns on the map but it is limited. If they find the previous teams shot down chopper they can find some more advanced weapons as well as an experimental AS-01 suit which hides their body temperature from the predators. Injured humans must be helped by teammates. If a player loses a leg a tourniquet may be applied and they can be carried on an improvised stretcher by teammates but they can still shoot while on it. \n\nAdditional human mechanics: Traps can be built if the players want to camp an area. \n\nEnvironment: The island will be several km in size and have random spawn points for players as well as extraction points. The game would take about 1 hour but could also have modes for up to 3 hours in a larger size. \n\nVR: The entire game is in VR with no hud at all, all aiming is done with iron sights. The only overlays are helpers for foraging wood for and vines for splints and tearing of cloth material for bandages/tourniquets. Adrenaline and other boosts may be found on the map which aid in movement or damage reduction. If a human loses his team he may get lost completely as there are no team markers. \n\nVoicecoms: Humans all have radios which they can use for communication. Predators can hear their voice if they have vision on the humans. \n\nEngine: Unreal Engine 4 would be ideal. This upcoming plugin has the capability to create a great island for this game: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmIonLe9qfQ\n\nInvisibility effect: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZQo89xUqxs\n\nThermal vision: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CpjV0a09pg\n\nHuman gameplay would look similar to this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qz54KyflH-Q"
jbbduw,Trying to develop a IRL challenge game,A bit of an odd request here but I’m making a game where the players objective is to try to get two tickets out of some kind of contraption that their housed in but ultimately it should be reasonably difficult but not impossible to get to the tickets.

jb8pgx,Nazi Zombies Meets Stickman Archer,"**Progressively difficult waves of zombies come at you as you hold them off with your bow until you inevitably succumb.** \n\nNazi Zombies was a bonus game mode for Call of Duty: World at War.  Stickman archer type games, I have to presume you've played, otherwise the title is pretty self explanatory.\n\n# Basic Mechanic\n\n* You have successive waves of zombies coming at you and you have to kill them a la stickman archer.\n* Each wave has more zombies, and faster zombies.\n* This is an un-winnable game, it's all about holding on for as many waves as you can before you inevitably get got. A highscore game.\n\n# Style\n\nThere would be two basic, different ways of doing it. Either \n\n1. Side On, like stickman archer (maybe the zombies enter from off screen and just come at you). Perhaps only light up the side of the screen that you're facing to add to the horror of the unknown. \n2. Top Down. This would probably be more difficult to make a satisfying shooting mechanic, but easier to make a more satisfying nazi-zombie-esque survival mechanic with multiple doors, windows, ramparts or whatever to cover.\n\n# Extra Mile\n\nWhat I've described so far is a pretty basic game. The following could maybe stretch the game a little further.\n\n* Head shot insta-kills, and extra points too.\n* Limited ammo that has to be purchased between waves with the points you've earned\n* Weapons upgrades you can purchase (like nazi-zombies. Maybe more powerful bow, fire arrows, multiple arrows, more accurate bow, cross-bow etc.\n* Torches you can purchase and place around your camp to allow you to see the zombies coming from farther away.\n* Mechanic whereby zooming in allows you to shoot more accurately, at the sacrifice of not seeing the zombies coming from as far away.\n* Different zombie types of progressing difficulty: Lumbering and shuffling; crawling (difficult head shot), hobbling, SPRINTING, ducking and dodging.\n* Barricades that the zombies rip down that you have to put back up between waves.\n* Online leaderboards.\n* Online co-op.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading this far, sorry if my first post on this sub is too long or if the game idea is too basic."

jaxz5a,"A 3rd person action RPG where upgrades and powers are centered around music, maybe an MMO","Let' Imagine a game where you are a character where you find a magic pair of headphones, and the story really isn't the important part, just that combat is centered around the in game music where you have combat and abilities, and you unlock abilities from a tree, the cool part comes in when you slot music, you can begin to play music from a select (probably unlocked by finding it, or some other system, some powerful songs would be hidden in the world) and it changes your basic attack (which will be locked as a sword type deal, maybe a microphone just for aesthetic) into a weapon suiting the song, as well as a change in coloration of the player in addition to some visual flare to match the song. Lets say a release from PS5, and they release some Final Fantasy Music into the soundtrack, you could play maybe Final Fantasy IX's combat music, and you'd turn into the black mage Vivi, and combat skills would be transformed based on the level / type of skill, a triple slash might become a swirling ice vortex and your basic attack is a barrage of fireballs and your weapon becomes a staff, or lets say you play One Winged Angel from Final Fantasy VII, it would give you the bangs, your hair would go white, your sword would elongate, and your skills would change to teleport-y / multi slash skills just like Sephiroth. Basic attacks would obviously change as well when the music is played. Each skill having a alternate form when you play music could be awesome. Maybe you could go in and unlock modifiers for the musical skills, idk."

The light will keep them away but it will slowly run out of energy. Also, your generator will break occasionally so you'll have to repair them. The traps you laid out of your home will slow down the vampires. If you ran out of gasoline and are really desperate, you can go out and look for some but there are vampires outside.

jau1me,"A glider and community game, set inside a wormhole","I had an idea when playing Minecraft (from Smash Bros): What if you could just jump off of a platform, glide around, make friends and never stop unless you wanted to? It's just gliding around from island to island, bringing a community of people into your world, and upgrading your island platform. \n\nHere are the basics of gliding and island building:\n\n1. You start on a deserted, floating island surrounded by other deserted, floating islands. This takes place in a wormhole\n2. You travel to other places via glider, which is the only modern thing on the island. There is no bottom of the map; it's just a wormhole leading from the ""bottom"" to the ""top"". There will be enough space to be able to dive at maximum speed and not be interrupted by any islands.\n3. You can get resources by getting onto an island and mining them. The resources regenerate from once every 10 seconds (more common materials) to once every 30 minutes (rarest materials).\n4. You use said materials to create a larger, more aesthetically pleasing island by using the materials to either upgrade the island size or building blocks to use to make structures. Your island can be upgraded in size a maximum of 10 times.\n\nHere are the basics of the community aspect:\n\n1. Once you make your first island upgrade (which will be pretty fast), you can invite friends over to join your wormhole using a code, which will slightly expand in physical to be able to fit them.\n2. There is no island size requirement to join a wormhole with the exception of a capacity limit of 8 people per wormhole.\n3. This capacity limit can be increased, however, by two extra people per the owner's island upgrade level. The maximum number of people per wormhole can expand up to 20 people per wormhole, even if the formula may say that more may be allowed (due to data conserving, the amount of people allowed per wormhole will be limited). The capacity upgrade will be unlocked by the person who started the shared wormhole.\n4. Your friends can play in the wormhole at any time, similar to a Minecraft Realm, though it is best to play with multiple people at a time. Having at least two others actively online in the wormhole will slightly increase your material collection rate and will hasten the regeneration time.\n\nHere are the basics of the fighting aspect:\n\n1. If two people collide in mid-air at a normal speed, they will enter a freefall for a short period of time (about 1.5 seconds). If one person hits another at a normal speed, the glider will tumble for a short period of time and the grounded one will fall and slide a short distance.\n2. If one person crashes into another person at max glider speed, they will both explode and have to respawn at their bases. If two people collide at max speed in midair, they will a) both explode, and b) get an achievement and a special, one-time statue to put on their island.\n3. If somebody is harvesting a resource and/or in a menu while they get hit by someone, they won't be affected by the collision (this is done to avoid unfair trolling).\n\nTL;DR, this is if Minecraft's Skyblock had multiple islands with different resources, gliders, and collision physics\n\nIf you have any questions, comments, or suggestions, please let me know. I am looking for a developer to take this idea (with my consent) and build it somehow. Thank you for your time!"
jatnje,A game where you play as an evil robot/Ai that is attempting to take over the world.,"For the story a man tries to create an robot called MotherBoard that can be used to help find ways to create peace  in the world but instead of finding a more humane way the robot finds an inhumane way of creating peace which is enslaving humans and giving them very strict rules and laws. (Im not sure entirely what type of game this should be but this is one of my ideas, feel free to tell me ideas of gameplay in the comments). The game would be a third person shooter. You start out escaping from the facility you were created in an hiding in a abandoned warehouse. Throughout the game you will go through each continent(except maybe Antartica)    Slowly taking them over. I would say you would spend 3 to 4 hours on one continent and once you are done taking it over you will go on to the next. Im not sure if this is a good idea but i was thinking the game is hard at first but gets a bit easier for each country you take over since your army of robots grows. I imagine the music would have an evil cinematic Synthwave vibe to it. If there were to be a sequel i think it would be cool to go bigger and have Morherboard start taking over planets with Aliens on them but that would probably be the final game since you cant go bigger than that but if i were to think of an third game maybe an resistance of humans and aliens. Feel free to tell me your thoughts in the comments below."
jarxgd,Best Friend - The Story of a Dog’s Life,"I’ve had an idea in my head for a while now about a choices-matters style 3rd person life simulator of a dog. It starts off with a puppy 1st being born in a litter fight for milk and playing with its brothers and sisters, then progresses to a new apartment, followed by a new birth, moving to a new home, playing with the new human, learning the various smells around, learning commands and keysounds (dogs don’t speak people after all), and all sorts of nonsense until ending in that one way all stories about dogs end. The goal of this game would be to make you feel for your real life best friends both old and new. \n\nThe way choices would matter in this game would be based on filling certain needs and associations. People such as the humans taking care of the dog would star off as shadow figures filled with mystery until time is spent smelling them or trying to memorize their features. Small choices would influence later choices like whether or not to bark at a new shadow, to approach or be shy, to smell or bite, etc. such choices would determine how the humans would treat the dog later. Other choices like wether or not to investigate a new smell or spend time napping would determine the dog’s personality in the long run. \n\nAs time would go on, certain key events would lead the story such as a new home, a new baby, a new diet, a new dog, certain “scares” like playing too close to a road, etc. In age, the dog would have less energy and require more naps. Vet visits would become more frequent. The baby would be a child by now, and the dog’s best friend. The child would the the dog’s main source of affection. Then there would come a day that the dog simply has no energy. In the end, no matter what choices the player would make in the web of choices, all dogs go to heaven. One final visit to the vet would be the final scene of this game. \n\nAnd that’s my game idea. A story about man’s best friend from the perspective of the dog. The title is a play on this, but from the dog’s perspective, you were the real best friend all along."

You have full access  to these parts, with 6 choices for each parts, and more added when the game would be updated.\n\nThe limbs can change, but you also have DNA upgrades that stick regardless\n\nThe thing is that heals don't naturally spawn, instead, you have to eat killed opponents, once you eat them, you regain health. This rewards aggressive playstyles.\n\nSo what do all of you think? Thoughts appreciated."

If this is way too long I apologize and accept that it may be removed by the mods - I don't know if excessive detail is a good or bad thing in this sub's eyes. \n\nFor the longest time I've had an idea bouncing around in my head for a game that involves you and a group of friends crewing a contemporary research ship as you explore a procedurally generated island-laden ocean. While I want the exploration itself to be rewarding (more on that later) I actually want it to be a secondary mechanic. Islands and other points of interest will, on average, be somewhere around 5-20 minutes apart, because the core gameplay is going to be focused on operating, maintaining, and upgrading the ship. \n\n**PLAYER ROLES**\n\nThe players will be able to assume different roles on the ship:\n\nEngineer - able to repair and operate equipment the best. This obviously means the ship's propulsion system but also includes the ability to repair utility vehicles, field equipment, etc. \n\nScience Officer - Most effective at operating sensors, utilizing resources (example: refining raw oil in to usable fuel), and studying things in the field. They also double as the ship's medic and are able to heal injured crew. \n\nCaptain - Owns the ship (both in-universe and also in real life, as the ship will be persistently saved to the captain's profile). The most effective at operating the helm and the only player able to set the ship's autopilot or operate the navigation system (all players will be able to VIEW navigation, but the captain is the only one who can actually set waypoints, plot courses, etc.)\n\nIt should be noted that these roles are ""soft"", and any player is free to do any job except for the few specific functions mentioned above that are locked to the captain. HOWEVER, if you're doing something outside of your specialty you will be doing so at a significant nerf. For example, there is nothing stopping a scientist from repairing the ship's engine, but because they aren't an engineer the repair will take a lot longer than it would have if an actual engineer had performed it. Or another example: an engineer is free to take the helm and steer the ship, but it's going to be significantly less responsive than if the captain was doing it, etc. \n\n**SHIP CUSTOMIZATION**\n\nA big part of the strategy of the game will be strategically customizing the ship in a few different ways to suit your crew's play style and preferred mission type:\n\nPropulsion system: there will be different propulsion systems available with different pros and cons. For example, you can choose to have your ship be powered by sails, which is very low cost, low maintenance, and means you have no fuel restrictions, but on the other hand is also very slow and very fragile. Or you could go to the other extreme and have a nuclear power system, which is very fast and also has no fuel restrictions, but is very expensive and requires a high degree of maintenance to keep from breaking down. Or maybe you want to choose a middle-of-the-road option and have diesel propulsion, which sports respectable speed and reasonable maintenance requirements but also means you'll need to refuel often (which may be challenging when you're out in unexplored waters). In addition to choosing the TYPE of propulsion, you will also be able to upgrade them so that they work more effectively. Upgrades can be performed by your ship's engineer while at sea, but if you want to completely replace the type of propulsion you'll need to put in to a shipyard and pay money. \n\nSensors: As a research ship, you're outfitted with a wide array of sensors. Some of them are standard, such as basic navigational radar. These ""standard"" sensors can't be removed but they can be upgraded, either by paying money at a ship yard or by having your ship's science officer apply research to them. In addition to the standard sensors you'll also have slots for installing optional scientific sensors that support your mission in various ways. For example, if your crew is interested in exploring undersea wrecks then you may choose to install subsurface sonar in one of your slots. If you're more interested in discovering mine-able resources on islands then maybe you nix the sonar and instead choose to use your slot to install a remote geo scanner, etc. Just like the standard sensors, your science sensors can be upgraded by your Science Officer, or swapped out completely at a shipyard. The number of science slots your ship has will depend on how much your ship has leveled up - a noob's ship may only have one slot, whereas a ship belonging to a more experienced captain may have been upgraded to have like 4 slots. \n\nUtility vehicles: Your ship is too large to just roll up and beach itself on an unexplored island with no proper docking facilities. Likewise, it's not a submarine so it can't dive down on its own to explore wrecks and underwater phenomenon. Instead, you're going to have to drop anchor nearby and launch a utility vehicle to access the point of interest. Similar to science sensors, your ship will have a number of vehicle slots (the number of slots will depend on how much your ship has been leveled up), and you're free to strategically choose which vehicles you want to install in those slots. If you like to explore underwater you may choose to have a minisub or an ROV installed in a slot. If you plan on taking a lot of loot or raw materials from an island then you may want a landing craft with lots of cargo space. If you want to be able to survey islands quickly you might want a smaller fast landing craft or perhaps even a helicopter, etc. There will be pros and cons to each vehicle, it's up to you to decide what's best for your mission and play style. Like with everything else, your crew can upgrade the vehicles at sea (in this case, it would fall to either the engineer or the captain I haven't decided yet) but you need to dock at a shipyard to completely swap vehicles out. \n\nCosmetic customizations: Each crew member will have their own personal quarters on the ship that can be decorated and arranged to their liking. Your quarters are saved to your personal profile so no matter which ship you join your customized space is always there for you. While aboard ship your crewmates are free to visit your quarters and you are free to visit theirs, but only you can edit your own room. Decorations for your quarters are obtained by either buying them at shipyards or by discovering them while you're out in the world (for example, if you find a treasure chest in a shipwreck you're able to take it and keep it for display in your quarters). The ship will have a common lounge space that can be decorated by the captain and is saved as part of the ship's file. Likewise, the name of the ship, her flag, and her paint job will be decided by the captain (but only when docked at a shipyard). \n\nSome of these decorations will be more than just aesthetic: they'll be functional in a way. For example, a flat screen TV that's able to stream real-life YouTube videos, or an arcade cabinet with a working knockoff of Pong or something. I want ""functional"" decorations because the idea is that half the time your underway you'll be busy maintaining the ship, but the other half the time you'll all be chilling as friends in the ship's lounge or in somebody's quarters just hanging out and socializing. This might be an older reference, but if you've ever gotten a bunch of friends together on a sandbox Gmod server and just did random shit for the fun of it, that's the kind of feeling I'd like to capture. \n\nCHALLENGES/HAZARDS\n\nWhile at sea, the ship's systems will require maintenance at regular intervals. The exact frequency with which maintenance needs to be done will depend on 1. what type of system it is and 2. what level the system is. Using propulsion systems as examples: A diesel engine will require less frequent maintenance than a nuclear plant, and a diesel that's been upgraded to level 3 will require less frequent maintenance than a diesel that's still at level 1, etc. Failure to provide regular maintenance increases the chance of the system breaking down.\n\nIf a system breaks down it will no longer function until it's repaired. How long it takes to repair something depends on 1) whether the crewmember doing the repair is the right specialty for the job, 2) what level the crewmember is at. In other words, a level 3 scientist can repair a sensor faster than a level 1 scientist can, and an engineer or a captain is going to be slow at repairing a sensor regardless of their level because they're the wrong specialty. I go back and forth on whether ""field repairs"" should also cost resources - I'd like to hear opinions on that. In addition to field repairs, you can also instantly repair a system (for money) if you're docked at a shipyard. \n\nThere will be hazards at sea which can threaten both crew and ship. For example: getting caught in deadly storms, being attacked by large sea creatures, fire breaking out on board, etc. During these disasters the chances of ship's systems breaking down drastically increases, and it will become a chaotic scramble to keep everything repaired (or at least patched up enough to limp along) until the danger has passed. The ship won't be the only thing in danger, however - there's an extremely high chance players will become injured while they're in the fray. If you become injured you'll require medical attention from the science officer to heal you back up. If you succumb to your injuries, you'll die. If you get tossed overboard and aren't rescued within a certain time limit, you'll die. \n\nExploring out in the field has its own dangers: Wild animal attacks could injure crewmembers, environmental disasters could hurt crew or damage equipment, underwater mishaps could damage your minisub or rob you of your precious oxygen supply, etc. The rules ""in the field"" are pretty similar to aboard ship: If equipment breaks it won't be usable until it's repaired, if a crewmember is injured they'll need medical treatment or they'll die, etc. \n\nPlayer death will be majorly inconvenient, but not permanent. If a player dies there will be a cool-down period of several minutes, after which they will respawn somewhere close-ish (but not too close) to the ship, either on an island or in a lifeboat, and need to be rescued. The player will not be fully back in the game until they are rescued and back on board the ship. Until they're rescued, a dead player will be stuck in a spectator mode. Upon death, players will lose any inventory they were carrying at the time as well as lose any leveling progress they had made since the last time they docked at a ship yard. Keep in mind that a player dying is not only inconvenient for the player themselves, but is also going to cause strategic challenges for the crew. For example: If your science officer dies then there's nobody to provide quick medical treatment, which means your injured crew will be shit out of luck until the science officer is re-spawned and rescued. If your engine gets fatally damaged and then your engineer dies, your ship is adrift until a much much slower non-engineer crewmember can get her fixed up again so they can go and rescue the engineer, etc. \n\nThe ship as a whole can also ""die"" in certain conditions: If every single crewmember dies, if there is overwhelmingly catastrophic damage, if the captain gives the order to Abandon Ship, etc. In all cases: when you lose the ship it will respawn with all the crew at the last shipyard you docked at (after a badass sinking animation, of course). The ship will lose all inventory, as well as lose any progress it had made since its last docking. If the crew successfully abandoned ship before she went down then they will retain their personal inventory and progress, but if they didn't abandon and decided to go down with the ship then they will lose everything just like if they had died on their own.\n\nIt should be clarified that since this game is designed to favor long expeditions, resetting to your last docking may represent a LOT of lost progress. Loss of ship will be rare but when it happens it will HURT. \n\nEXPLORATION MECHANICS\n\nI view the actual exploration as sort of ""icing on the cake"" or as a reward for successfully doing the main part of the game, i.e. operating your ship. That is why I'd like to see points of interest spread out very far with several minutes of travel time between them, anywhere from 5-20 minutes. \n\nPoints of Interest will be procedurally generated and consist of things like uninhabited islands, shipwrecks, geologic anomalies, etc. Each type will have different potential hazards and different potential rewards - for example shipwrecks will be great for manufactured loot, islands good for animals/plant research &amp; resources, geologics are great for mining raw materials, etc. \n\nThe ""holy grail"" of discoveries will be finding a Colonization Candidate. These will be rare islands (say a 1 in 100 chance) that posses just the right parameters to build a land-side base on. When you find such an island, you'll be able to plant your ship's flag on it to ""claim"" it. Once claimed, the nearest already-established base will launch a colonization ship to sail to the new island and begin setting up shop there. Colonization ships move at a decent middle-of-the-road speed but they do travel in real time, so the farther out your new island is the longer it will take before a base gets built there. However, once the new colony is complete it will have a functioning ship yard with a dock, which means your ship will now have a new (and much closer) safe spot to save progress, buy new equipment, make repairs, etc. \n\nAs a research vessel, you will be paid for your exploration work. New discoveries will have a certain cash value tied to them depending on how rare they are and how thoroughly you studied them. For example: just sailing by a new island and noting it on your map will net you relatively little money, but actually dropping anchor and dispatching your science officer to set foot on the island and study the wildlife will make the payout much greater. The catch: you only get paid for your discoveries when you dock at a shipyard to turn them in. If you lose the ship you will lose any discoveries made since you last docked. This is another reason why finding a Colonization Candidate is going to be such a big deal: If you're able to establish a base closer to where you are that makes it a lot easier for you to turn in discoveries and get money."
jagfkp,A New Take On “Loot Based Gameplay”,"Instead of having a crap ton of duplicates filling up your inventory, or having a bogus ass ranking system where “Legendary” items are weaker then some Common items, why don’t we do this instead: every gear item is common! You get it once and that’s it, it’s in your inventory.\n\nBut when you find a duplicate of that item, instead of hogging up your inventory it automatically upgrades the gear piece you already have! And ever one hundred levels (which would be really freaking easy to get to with so many duplicates), you can rank up that gear item to increase its rank, letting the *player* assemble a set of Legendary gear *through simply playing the game!*"
jafbta,Inner Worlds (The Game of Everything),"  \n\n**Inner Worlds (The Game Of Everything)**\n\nThis game is meant to be played anywhere, at any time, with anything and everything. You do not need to any anything other then you already do outside of this game, or if you want to buy an asset that you want to play in this game. These assets of course, do not need to be bought, they can also just be remembered, took a picture of, or anything else and then be implanted into the game. This game can be played online, on paper, in your head or a combination of these examples. Cause that’s what they are, examples. In this guide I will be telling you the ideas of the game, and examples of how to play the game. But the main focus will be that this game can be fully designed, controlled and played however you want it to be. Remember this, this is YOUR game, not mine and not someone else’s that is also playing the game, however, if you join another’s game, it will be only fair to play by their rules, as it is most important that the “host” of the game stays the one that has to continue the story. \n\nI will be discussing multiple topics in this guide, such as:\n\n\- **Starting your game**\n\n\- **Making characters / Making a story to start with**\n\n\- **How to implement objects, places, people etc.**\n\n\- **Playing with others**\n\nDisclaimer: Anything and Everything I say during the rest of this guide will be my interpretation of the game, the things I say are NOT, by any means the rules, playstyles, guidelines or anything else that you will HAVE to play with, you can change anything I say, leave out anything you don’t want, or add anything if you feel like it will be a good thing for how you want to play. I am just here to give you an general guide of how the game is thought of when I created it, how I think about I will play it and nothing else. Feel free to destroy my work and replace it with something you feel like is better, it is YOUR game, do what you feel is right and fun to play.\n\nAlright, now that that’s out of the way, lets start with the basics. What is the general idea of the game and how do we even start playing?\n\n**Chapter 1: Starting your game**\n\nOk, so you found this guide, and you want to read more, either because you think it’s interesting or just a plain stupid idea. But what is this game even, what do you I have to imagine playing it? Well, lets start at the beginning. In this game, the main idea is that you are playing a role in a story, sort of like D&amp;D, but my idea is to not only play with things that are made up, or in a fantasy story. Rather, I have this idea of implementing things from all around you, take a look around right now, what do you see? Anything that’s here with you right here, right now could be implemented in your game. But how we do this, we will talk about later. First we need to settle a few things. How do YOU want to play? Do you want to write everything down, draw pictures and make progress on paper? Do you want to search for images, and play your story online, on for examples Word, Tabletop Simulator or all over the web? Do you want to play everything in your mind, so you can instantly make any move you want right where you are, without have to have anything with you? Of course, you can also mix these thing up, to make you playstyle more fun, or easy to play with!\n\nYou will also have to set some basic guidelines, at least, if that is what you want. You could just skip this part and make up rules at any time or at any move you make during the story, or just play without, and let everything flow as you want! But if you do want to set some basic rules, Here are a few examples:\n\n· Never, will a player, objects or any other asset in the game, will have the power of infinite life, invincibility or another factor that will be considered “overpowered”.\n\n· The amount and level of loot found, will be generally determent by either a die, random number generator or (insert your method here).\n\n· “Safe Heaven Tokens (SHT’s)” will have to be acquired only in boss fights, marketplaces or (Insert your method here).\n\nThese are a few examples of what kind or rules you could implement into your game. More rules can be found later.\n\n**Chapter 2: Making characters and places**\n\nSo you got a general idea of how to want to play, and with what kind of rule settings you want to work with. Now lets start forming a story and a character. In the starting period of the game, my advise, if you don’t have anything to work with of course, is just to start rambling some things out. They do not have to make sense, let alone be actually played with, just think about some random stories you find interesting. Now is also a good time to start thinking about maybe if you want to play by a certain genre, or multiple genres at once. Maybe you want to play a Horror story, adventure story, action story or maybe even a horror adventure action story, I don’t know, you decide. Do you want to make something realistic, or something even World of Warcraft, Neverwinter or Path of Exile didn’t think of? Maybe you’ll outwrite Lovecraft at his own style, who knows what your imagination will create! \n\nStart thinking of a place. This can be an enormous universe, a world, a city, a house or even just a room you want to start playing in. You don’t have to create everything at once, except of course if that you playstyle. You can start really small and let in evolve into something bigger as you go. Or maybe your story fits in just that one room, that can lead into some interesting options as well. But don’t forget you can also just use a place you already know! Like a place in a videogame, movie or maybe you want to start your story in your own backyard, or that park you visit every morning to walk your dog. Play in the city you always wanted to go, at the club you used to go with your friends or the classroom you have to go to first thing tomorrow. Really, your choice.\n\nThen for your characters. You can start with the character, or characters you yourself want to play with. These can, but don’t have to be the main characters of your story. The main character can also be the god, or for examples end boos of the story. But you can also start with creating, maybe monsters you’ll face, if you want to add those. Whatever you want to make first. If you go for, let’s say, one character that you play as the main character of the story. Think of what is character is. Is it really you, as in the one writing this? Is it even human? Is it an animal or a different kind of lifeform? Maybe you want your story to play out as a group of cells, then you follow your species of cells as it form a bigger and bigger for of life. Maybe you want to play as a character from a movie, or the game you’ve been playing for years. So let’s say your character is human. Does your story involve magic? Are you a master of the mystic arts or are you just starting your learning program, for example: are you Dumbledore or are you first year’s Harry Potter? Maybe you want to play a game in a Medieval world, are you the King of a big kingdom? Or do you start out as the one who cleans up the mess others leave behind? Other things you might add are:\n\n· Personality\n\n· Things your character is good or bad at\n\n· Things your character carries around everywhere\n\n· The history of your character\n\nThese are all optional, and you can add everything else as your story moves on.\n\n**Chapter 3: Implementing objects**\n\nObjects can play a big, or a small part of your story. And there are different ways of using items in your game. Some items may not need really in-depth information about them, depending how what it is, when you use it or what impact it has on the game. If it fits into the game you could just say that you quickly ate an apple on you way to the castle, it doesn’t have to be a big deal. But you can also say maybe, you quickly ate an apple on your way to the castle, which refills your hunger by 10, and then threw it on a dog that’s sleeping on the side of the road, who then got angry at you and tried to attack you. Then it’s a bit of a bigger deal. Maybe your at a market, who sells apples. Then you want a price for the apple(‘s), and maybe what kind of quality it is. Does it have side-effects? Or does it just refills your hunger status? Now this was just an example of an apple, but this can be done with anything. Potions, weapons, technology, pets, houses, to just name a few.\n\nMaybe with every item you get, buy or find you want to write down a quick overview of that item, so you can remember the info later, and carry it around for a while. This can be a really short or really long description, depending on how you want to play, or what the object is. Maybe for a potion, you’ll want to write down the name of the potion, what it does, how many times you can use it and any side-effects it may have. Maybe for a weapon you can note the quality of the weapon, how much damage it does and what the durability of the weapon is. This can also be done with enemies you might face, places you visit, contacts you have and characters you play.\n\nHow do you get items? Maybe you start with some, but maybe at some point, you’ll add new ones. You can find items as you travel, when you defeat an enemy, buy them at a store or a market or maybe you trade your items for new ones.\n\n**Chapter 4: Playing with others**\n\nThere are two basic ways of playing with others, either starting a game together, or join someone in their already made story. Lets discuss both in separate parts.\n\n1. Starting a game together.\n\nLets say you have a group and want to play the game together, this one is easier then if you want to play in a game that has already been started by others. Just talk about what everyone’s ideas are, and form a story together. Are you all main characters? Are some of you the players and others the enemies? Are you two kingdoms facing each other for ultimate glory? Are you a group of special soldiers that have to take on a big enemy together? What rules do you agree on to make it fair for everyone? Are you going to play at a table with the group, in a D&amp;D kind of setting? Or is your story taking place in the real world? And do you meet, and travel to places in real time? Will you design your own map to follow your quest and story or do you go where ever Google Maps takes you? If you play in the real world, there are of course rules and laws you have to keep in mind. Don’t go into places you are not allowed to, and don’t disturb others when you are playing the game. But aside from that, go explore the world! Make the adventure as real as it can be in the world we ourselves live in! \n\n2. Joining another’s game\n\nThis one may be a bit more complicated. Since you’re joining a game that has already started, you will have to follow the rules and settings the Host has made. Don’t mess with the story of another player, as they designed it the way they want their story to go. Let the Host explain what rules there are, how they play and what the story of the game contains, make your character that makes sense in the story and follow the guidelines the Host gives you to do so. Go with the flow of the story and the rest will follow, as there could been made a lot of decisions already. Maybe when you join the game, the host was just about to start a war and now you’re in the middle of it! Maybe the war is just over and you come in at the point that the whole village has been destroyed. You don’t know, so ask the host for any info you need to play, and make sure everyone is enjoying your stay, especially yourself! Maybe you just want to play in the Host’s story for a little bit, if so, make sure you end your part of the story well, and not with open gaps. \n\nReally it’s up to you with how many players you want to play. If you enjoy playing with a group, make it a good time with everyone! But if you’d rather play alone, go for it! You can always decide later if you want more players, or else just create wonderful, amazing worlds and stories by yourself! \n\n**Chapter 5: Overview**\n\nSo, there it is. A sprinkle of what this game is, how it can be played, where and when! I will write more topics later, maybe going more in-depth into certain topics, and giving more examples of them. But for now I just want to give the basic idea of the vision I have when creating this game. This is only the beginning! There is an infinite amount of things I could talk about, stories to tell, characters to create, enemies to imagine, worlds to explore and items to be found.\n\nI want to thank you for taking the time to read this, and I hope I could make you interested to read more! I’ve had this idea in my mind for a long time, and now is the time to let it out! \n\nIn other guides I will go deeper in to topics like:\n\n· Making characters\n\n· Creating Enemies\n\n· Generating worlds and places\n\n· Item design\n\n· And many more!\n\nI will also document the stories and games I come up with myself and post them online, for you to get examples of how to play, and what to play with.\n\nPlease leave your own ideas below, as I am really interested in ways you imagine playing this game!\n\nThis was your Host Tylerion, go play and open your Inner Worlds!"
ja97lw,Any Simple Mobile Game Ideas Out There?,Any game you've personally wanted to play on your phone?
ja83xy,The Tale of the Mist,[deleted]
ja78qf,Full Counter game - new member,"Hello, im new here. Just found out that you can place ideias on this site, so here I go. \n\nThe latest game Idea that I had was one that I named “Full counter” (title could change), Its a action game that has its own futurist/post future bio-genetic war scenario. (This scenario came to me as a book/movie Idea that later on I saw gaming potential, If anyone be interested I could make a post about this universe/story. \n\nWith all that said, we have the protagonist/hero that is this normal guy in a world where people are getting bio-genetic upgrades more and more often ( example: in this universe u could pay to get all the attributes from a tiger, the more u pay, the less it will show on your body, the less you pay “ilegal” you’ll get a lot of tiger features in your body and thats wack). \n\nSo this hero doesn’t want any upgrades due the attention and dangerous it brings. But someday he was on a situation where he got a rare bio-genetic mutation, that wasn’t meant for him, but for a Rich enterprise man that controls the city (and the main villain haha).\n\nThis mutation gives him the power of counter reaction, now thats when the fun begins.. he is invulnerable to almost everything, he can counter bullets, punches,shockwaves(when I say counter I mean that que can give back the same amount of damage to de source without taking any) u name it, but he must have it on his sight or else his ability won’t activate and he will suffer damage.\n\nThe game will put you against all types of dangers, it will be your job to counter every situation the best way possible.\n\nThis is all that I can say for now, I made this post to see if someone might be interested or could help me to get in touch with any big game developers. This concept is just the “tip of the iceberg” there is a hole world behind this idea. \n\nIm just a guy with a crazy head for creation, I have this and many more ideas to share (mostly games and movies). Lets see where this post can take this initiative. \n\nSorry about my English and\nThanks for the attention!"
ja6p46,Semi Open World Survival Game,"the idea is this :  \n\-either coasts of the us or other countries  \n\-build up a civilization after the near extinction of humanity  \n\-game is set in the future (as to allow creative design of weapons)  \n\-human enemies and monster enemies (humans are not to be trusted)  \n\-survival mechanics (such as drinking , eating and using medkits)\n\ngot this idea after hearing what dead space 4 coulda been where its like a space adventure to try and fight the moon things   \ni want this game to have a story centered around a group of people building up a camp to try and survive in the new world order after the near destruction of humanity honestly this game can be as big as someone wants i really think itd be cool though"
ja33i9,"Im creating a game where you are a fruit or vegetable who fights others foods, but I cant come up with any attacks","Essentially, you pick a character and fight others in free for all, team deathmatch, or other game modes. However, I have 21 characters so far and don't know any movesets for them. Each character has a Neutral attack, and does not have a cooldown. A special, that has from 3-10 seconds based on power/range/etc. Power, which is on a roughly 45 second cooldown. and finally an ability which can usually be used once per round.\n\nCharacters and other info In comments"

j9yypp,Modern version of Blackwake (Teams command Carriers/Warships),"Like Blackwake, and other pirate ship games, the goal is to sink the enemy ships.\n\nInstead of using cannonballs, you would use modern cannons, airplanes, (and maybe mines?)\n\nOf course, there would be a repair mechanic to patch up holes in the hull and perhaps some hoses around the ship to put out fires.\n\nEach player would be one man on deck, with many tasks to do; fire cannons, control the ship, fly the airplanes, ect. (Maybe use elevators to bring more aircraft to the runway?)\n\nI think any artstyle would work fine, from a more realistic to more of a lower rez, polygon sort of art.\n\nI think thats about it for now, i wouldnt want to create a rulebook for anyone to follow or anything"
j9ueiq,I am looking for some awful mechanics for my 2d platformer to make it quite interesting. Any suggestion will be appreciated.,
j9oi7w,A Rogue like based on an Athenian youth trapped in the Labyrinth of the Minotaur,"I've been playing a lot of rogue-likes for the past month to kill time after class and one game I ran into was Void Bastards wherein the player had to go through several enemies and whenever they died (which would happen a lot), the player would get to pick another character and to apply upgrades and the like to improve the next play through. Now although a rogue-like dungeon crawler is not a new concept, I was wondering, how about one (single/multiplayer) game based off of the Labyrinth of the Minotaur?\n\nPlayers would be trying to find their way out of the labyrinth while fending off the minotaur who could spawn in at any time. Could be a little horror-like. I was thinking ever time the player died, he or she would get to pick a perk or a piece of equipment to help himself/herself escape the labyrinth. I thought perhaps the map of the labyrinth be randomly generated so the exit would be different per game. I also thought about making the Minotaur sensitive to certain conditions to avoid the monster from becoming too easy to fool. Maybe some lore could also be found along the game? Would some NPCs also be nice to do that? Making it multiplayer also sounds nice where you can either work together or screw the other person over. \n\n\nWhat do you guys think of this concept?"
j9ndin,Multiplayer Maze Run (Super-Mega-Concept),This idea is extremely volatile.
j9mktw,Special Operations Forces Battle Royale,"Special Operations Forces Battle Royale\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. 5 players per squad. You will have weapons with you, Assault rifle/Sniper rifle/MANPADs rocket (pick 1), handgun, knife, frag grenades, flashbang, smoke grenade, standard issued SOF gear (like helmet, body armor, Night vision google, etc)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2. 100 players battle royale. The map has its own enemy call Private Military Contractor (PMC), player need to fight this PMC in order to survive. There will be also random weapons spread all over the map. This PMC will guard the main area like Airport, Military Base, Town, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3. You start the game by para jumping from a plane. Team leader can control this plane and fly anywhere on the map. You will be given 2 minutes to fly to your location. After the timer goes up, you will auto paradrop on your location.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n4. The map is huge. Your objective is to survive to the end. Similar to PUBG, player need to go to the new zone. However, if player out of the zone when the timer end, player will be automatically disqualified (in pubg, player will lose health over time slowly).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n5. The game will have all the modern weapon and machinery, including, a fighter jets, helicopter, tanks, mortar, toyota cavalry, combat superbike. Player can drive the jet and do a dogfight with other players in the air. Tactical drones, \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n6. Building can be destroyed. Player who pilot a jet can destroy the building with airstrikes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n7. Side mission. Rescue and evacuate a VIP on the map. There will be one VIP npc randomly located on the map and been held hostage in a prison. There will be NPC Private military contractor (PMC) enemy that guard the VIP. Defeat the PMC and save the VIP.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter you successfully save the VIP, talk to him and he will generate a random extraction zone location. Go to the extraction zone and wait for the helicopter. The VIP will get in the helicopter and the helicopter will drop a precious weapon to you. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe weapon is a Predator Missile Laptop (PML). PML will allow you to attack your enemy with an airstrike. This will be useful at the late game, when the play area is smaller and you no longer can use fighter aircraft for air support. It is game breaking and really give a huge advantage to the player that own it. PML will drop upon death, but can be destroyed in the explosions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n8. Realistic injury. Serious injury will be permanent. Sometimes you need to continue playing with a penalty to movement, health, weapon (you cant equip certain weapon if your hand is injured.). Eat food wont heal you, but increase your movement speed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n9. Photo realism graphic. Like pubg but more realistic. Intel HD 4000 can play the game with at least 30 fps (And of course you can play with the latest graphic card at the max setting). It will be free to play with competitive ESPORT and cosmetic shop. You can play a male or female operator. No nonsense cosmetic, most of the item are decent looking SOF, secret agent, modern clothes (no bunny suit or clown suit). The game will teach the player about modern warfare and Close quater combat (CQC). The game will have a real life scale, 100 meter will be the same like 100 meters in real life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n10. The game start a random time of the day, it could be at night, or during the day. The weather also random, it could be heavy rain or a fine weather. You will have several map like snowy map, sand map, jungle map, urban map (some looks like european, tokyo, south east asian, american).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n11. Cross platform. The game will available for PC, mobile, playstation, xbox\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n12. Character creation. Player can choose their character face, body height (150 cm to 200 cm), body weight, hairstyle. Player can choose their clothes including, Special force uniform (SPETSNAZ, SAS, SEALS TEAM 6,etc), secret agent clothes, or just a normal modern looking clothes."
j9ho3g,"Music game where you are a cartoony spider that shoots out webs at a certain length, the strings must be at a certain length to produce the right notes","The spider would scroll along the side of the screen and shoot web to the other side creating a strumming string, The game would help you at first in showing you how long the strings should be. The levels would be constituted of a mini-puzzle where you figure out the 4 notes, usually in a chord, and then a rhythm game leaping between the strings"
j9haur,A survival winter cabin game,"The style of the game would be somewhat relaxed but tense at night. It would be a mix of gathering materials for survival, (gathering firewood or buying/hunting food) maintaining communications, and maintaining/upgrading your cabin. You can upgrade your cabin manually or you could use pre-made rooms. You can die and you will be sent to your last save. I mentioned buying food. How you can do this is selling wood or tools. I believe both having to survive and being able to add on to your cabin would be great in vr (but this could work on a monitor)."

j9ajp6,Horror game with interactive live stream chat,I saw this idea somewhat explored in this one horror game made by the devs of Burberry Grove but it was a small feature and was mostly linear. What if someone made a horror game that further explored this idea?

j95k8i,Zombies in cages.,"Context: 2D Top down stealth action game. Trying to make it systemic. The game's major mechanic is that construction workers build the level while you're playing it.\n\nFirst of all, construction workers can carry these caged zombies. Why would they do that? Because they'll be occasionaly used as part of the traps.\n\nThat's right. You can release zombies. The enemies can too for their traps.\n\n They'll use their ears and listen for footsteps. Their vision is very short and used to actually detect the enemy.\n\nZombies attack by spitting zombie juice at humans. They spawn drop a puddle of zombie juice when they die. They will smell and eat corpses within a certain radius.\n\nA entity that gets into contact with zombie juice slowly takes infection damage.\n\nA antidote item can stop the infection. Enemies will also use it if they can.\n\nIf a entity dies due to an infection, they turn into a zombie version of themselves.\n\nThink I'll make the zombies a little faster or buffer than the average guard because they won't be appearing in masses.\n\nDoes this sound fun?"

j91wcz,A turn based RPG with mechanics of a Rhythm Game,"I have an idea for a game, no experience at all but I would like to eventually make this after learning. \n\nI don’t want to talk about it too much so I’ll just talk about the actual battles. \n\nThe battle looks like a simple layout, party members on the left, enemy on the right. You have 2 attacks per each 4 party members, and option to use healing items. But the enemy doesn’t attack you using moves. Between you and the enemy, in the middle of the screen are 6 circles, 3 on the left and 3 on the right. Coming from the middle of the 6 circles are tinier circles with arrows in them. They are up, down, left, and right. You need to wait until the circle with the arrow in it reaches on of the 6 circles to time your button press. (If you’ve played a persona dancing game that’s literally what in describing, I would probably change it a bit though to differentiate.) \n\nIf you miss or don’t time your presses correctly then you will lose an amount of health depending on how bad you missed. \n\nWhen it is your turn you do not have an infinite amount of time to pick what to do. You have a timer showing you how much time you have to act. (Time is usually 30 seconds or less.) But, in that short time you can attack as much as you want and heal as much as you want. The power of attacks and effectiveness of healing would go down slightly with each use though. \n\nThen, the boss attacks again and you do they rhythm game again until it is your turn. \n\nI was trying to to think of a unique battle system for an RPG and this is what I came up with. Please leave some feedback on what I can do to improve it or how I can go about making something like this."

j8zfxt,Goblin Village Recruit Monsters,"Game starts and your village has just been raided by 'heros' half your tents are destroyed, most of the residents killed including your father the previous leader.\n\nThe hero's will be back and before they are you must send out teams of goblins to find and recruit monsters, you might also have to build specialized structures like an ogre wants a meatery.\n\nHero's come back in bigger and bigger groups, bosses might be like named heros 'Lord Liadrin The Shining' or somesuch.\n\nMy thoughts are 2d mobile, unsure if to have named monsters in a gacha style or just recruiting on species and focus on monetary some form of currency that can spend to speed up missions/buildings\n\nPotentially instead of a straight city builder actually take a factorio style system, the goblins act as the conveyor system you have your raw materials and creating buildings to feed through those materials the materials going into buildings for recruiting an army to defend yourself and/or into more specialized buildings for higher tier unit requirements.\n\n50 food to the orge structure allows it to produce orges to fight for you, if you add in another resource you can get orge shamans, so classes are decided by what overall materials are being sent.\n\nThoughts?"
j8ypch,An first person movement shooter where you play as an agent trying to stop an terrorist organization from taking over the world.,"The game would be a single player story game where you play as an agent who has to stop an terrorist organization from taking over the world. In the game you can approach missions in various ways such as go the stealthy route or guns blazing. Some missions may require you to complete it a certain way.Like agents in the movies you will be given various gadgets that use up a certain amount of energy. For guns before a mission you can choose which guns you may want to bring and can customize the scope,range, etc. In battle you can pick up ammo or guns from the enemies you have killed. For the enemies there will be a variety of enemies you will encounter and the game would be action packed."
j8xdqu,"Retro 3D shooter, FPS or other non-overhead perspective","So the current indie paradigm of choice seems to be 2D pixel art games, often claiming to be retro reminiscent of a particular generation of 80s or 90s games.  They usually fail to capture that, but that's more marketing bullshit than their actual aim; the actual aim seems to be more like ""what if we had design ideas originating in these limitations, but removed some of the limitations.""  Is this a thing in FPSes?  \n\nI know this kind of thing exists in rhythm games and overhead Asteroids-style shooters.  And I know there are things like Ion whatever and all those 3D engined games with pixel art shoehorned in, and some of those are cool.    \n\n\nWhat I'm thinking of is more like what if you had Starfox-level (or maybe Star Blade) rendering and textures, but at modern resolutions, with thousands of times as many polygons?  And what if you had these capabilities but chose not to create the smooth curves that are possible now?  You just throw all the polygons at deeper, more complex environments, but with every element of those environments being chunky, smooth-shaded, and possibly textureless.  \n\nAnother way of thinking of this:  What if Star Fox 64 had tried to look like a slightly smoother Star Fox, just VASTLY MORE OF EVERYTHING.  This is something that could have been done, but wasn't because everyone was striving for realism, rather than a more detailed surrealism.    \n\n\nIn addition to the rail shooter example, I think this aesthetic could work for an FPS in a way that pre-quake 3D didn't really, because getting too close to objects would reveal their featurelessness...in this approach you could basically replace textures with polygons"

j8qlq6,First person parkour with a twist,Is this a good idea?  It is a first person parkour game but you have a weapon that you can switch from a grappling hook and an enderpearl gun. Your goal is to get to the other side of the map the grappling gun can pull you far but the downside is you can’t go over things and the epearl gun can only shoot a short distance but can go over things what do you think would this be a good game?
j8pbvn,"Factorio, but there’s another player who you have to kill to win the game.","The title might seem a tad bit confusing, so let me explain.\n\nTwo bases spawn on the opposite sides of the map; red and blue, respectively. During the match, you must build your base’s defenses while also employing attack units to destroy the other base. Resources come from the map itself that you must mine but do not regenerate, meaning you can possibly “steal” resources from the other player, thus making it a game of attrition.\n\nLighting is of heavy significance here. Among your base defenses and attack/mining units, you must deploy light sources, as without them you have no idea what’s in the dark, which can lead to ambushes from the enemy. *You cannot see light if it is from the enemy.*\n\nLmk if you have any suggestions for this."

j8kebg,A highly advanced Spore like game. Stylized like the film series Life Beyond by melodysheep,"I have long hoped for a new spore game or a remake. I loved making creatures and evolving them into better versions of themselves. When dark spore came out i was intrigued by the more ""grown up"" style that it had. But I was disappointed by the game mechanics and the missing creature creation that made spore so good. \n\nI recently saw the concept film Life beyond ll and loved the art style and visuals of both the creatures and the worlds. \n\nI think a game where you could explore evolutions like in the early stages of spore before you got to the more advanced (and boring) space exploration parts would be cool. Would love that the game had an emphasis on the whole evolution part and would dive deeper into the details within evolution of the creatures. I think single player is best for the game, but would be cool if it had some kind of share space where you could share the creatures you’ve made. I believe spore had something similar. \n\nDon’t know if I used the correct flair, im new here."

j8cwqn,A first person shooter game whose multiplayer is like esports but irl; you're fighting for your life as thousands of people watch and cheer for you and send pogs in the chat.,"The game takes place in post-collapse near-future America where foriegn invasions and anarchy have destroyed the country. I'll only be discussing multiplayer elements and not any story modes.\n\nIt's like some arcade shooter multiplayer where you got modes like: Team Deathmatch, Free for All Domination, Capture the Flag, maybe even Battle Royale... But everyone's got a gopro on their helmets and cameras are scattered throughout the maps. Drones fly overhead, it's fenced off, and going out of bounds results in your brains exploding. (Mini explosive is lodged in your skull.) Everything's live so smile for the camera.\n\nWeapons range from newly made military equipment to hundred year old weapons that are still in shape, I think. Such as AK-19's or old Lee Enfield rifles. You can equip sights that only shoot when lined up with enemy soldiers or makeshift suppressors and bayonets. Shields that grant somewhat of an invisibility cloak or metal and chainmill armour.\n\nThe music I think would somewhat fit would be a mix of heavy metal/techno with a mix of old western maybe. Locations range from suburban towns, ruined cities, canyons, mountains, swamy forests and deserts. \n\nIs it crap or cool?"
j8c7gx,"Really cool idea I had, pls send help","I am a beginner, looking to make a cool unity game, it’s has swords different types with different abilities, the main focus of the game is the movement, and the attacking, I don’t plan for it to be high graphics just like derpy guys, when you land an attack a meter comes up to chain together attacks, you can chain 3 attacks before the combo ends dealing different types of damage as your combo grows.\n\nI will proceed to explain the game in depth \n\nSo the main focus is the swords, they act as classes with different individual values (such as speed and stuff) they each come with 3 abilities a sword ability, secondary ability and a passive, the game has a rag doll physic, but in the end, all swords have 4 base stats \nSpeed Attack Defense and Range, each sword has all of these but in different amounts, meaning all of the weapons can be fairly balanced.\n\nMaps, the maps will be obviously designed to compliment the types of swords, you will have flank routes for speed, open areas for ranged, easy areas to pick fights in for attack characters and so on and so forth\nI wanna take a valorant like approach for each map, making it super unique every time.\n\nWeapon concepts\nI’ve thought of plenty but I will share 4 basic ones, focusing on the 4 types\nStarting with attack, easy to say it’s a great sword, reliable you have a shield and can defend with it.\nSpeed, Ninja blade, high speed, a secondary kunai that is a quick projectile that is also featured is some of his attacks, his special skill is a dash.\nDefense is a bat, slow attack speed use the special skill home run to hit a big score, and his secondary is a ball\nLastly range, range has a claymore, he does a big hit that stretches long, his secondary is a spike ball he can throw on the ground\n\nSo if anyone want to help a bit, hit me up I might not even make this just an idea so if someone wants to motivate me a bit it would really help, thanks for reading, if any of you have tips please tell them, I am a beginner, this sounds a bit hard for me so I will try to make something else before I try to make this."

hpfo96,Third person tactical military shooter with cosmic horror,"Hello, this is my first time posting here. I am a huge fan of cosmic horror, but also a fan of the sort of catharsis that comes from the almost unending world states you get in open world games where you ignore the plot and just faff about, chipping away at a seemingly neverending to-do list.\n\nI like third-person shooters and tacticool military themes, but all of those games are almost always so super serious about their gritty mature political themes, and I yearn for something different. I also like when games lean into their medium, with less cinematic storytelling and more engagement with gameplay systems. I like diagetic worlds, dynamic ones, I like environmental storytelling, I like when games present functioning machines or systems you get to go in and mess around with.\n\nSo, hungry for all of those things, I've been nursing this game idea in the back of my head for years, and I just have to share it--because I will never, ever make it. I lack the talent to pull it off. I'm an author, and I've toyed with writing a book about it, but so many of the ideas are meant for a videogame as the medium and really wouldn't work as a book.\n\nSo instead of sitting on it, grumpy that this totally awesome game isn't getting made, I figured I'd put it out into the ether--maybe somebody else can capture the essence where I cannot.\n\nFor formatting and readability I have written it in a doc. that I will link [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FAXKIwgjue5FQUSflOQUMxgkztHPV9CBiHYc41lt5DA/edit?usp=sharing), but if that's not allowed let me know and I'll make necessary changes for reposting.\n\nI tried to start with the bare bones gist, then expand to a more stylistic pitch, then to hit the important major mechanics (all of which I could write about for pages but decided not to bore anybody with), and then lastly the long-winded ""story"" of what the player experience would be like. It's long! But I hope it's digestible, and I hope y'all like it."
hpeiew,Jezzball like Battle Royal.,"[Jezzball is an old windows game where you try and cut away the map while balls bounce around trying to stop you. Once enough map is cut away you move on to the next level.](http://www.freewebarcade.com/game/jezzball/) \n\nIn this game the balls are players along with the person putting down barriers. \n\nInstead of trying to trap the balls in a small area like the original, those that get caught in a cut off part of the map will start to take out of bounds damage and will have to get back in. \n\nThe balls will be able to pick up power-ups that allow them speed themselves up and slow down others in various ways. They also have momentum and can try and bounce others out of bounds to take damage."
hpe5qw,Aircraft game idea,"Hello everyone,\n\nMy friend and I are thinking about developing a multiplayer aircraft game and we are in the part where we are just generating ideas which we can accomplish with some risks.   \nWe decided to come to Reddit and check what people want to play and what they have in mind, because the project is a personal project, there is no client behind it and we want to make something good and share it with the community and maybe provide it as open source for modification and not duplication.\n\nWe don't yet know how the world is, we don't know if we want it to be only in earth's atmosphere or in the outer space or in both of them, we don't know if we want it to be just beautiful landscapes and aircraft in the air, we don't know if we want to add a life on earth and link aircraft to it to add a little story to the game. We really don't know how it will look like but we know that it will be a great game and satisfying to play with your help.\n\n  \n**Please tell us what you think and what you want to play, we are open for any idea and we want to make something people would like to play and enjoy.**\n\n**Some additional info:**\n\n\- We chose the game to be about aircraft since they don't require animations.\n\n\- We will make it using Unreal Engine 4\n\n\- We are planning to export it for Windows, Linux and Android. If everything goes OKAY, we might change the game experience a little bit between desktops and smartphone but we think we can make it cross-platform and android players play with Windows player and Linux players, hopefully.\n\n\- We don't plan to make it a pay to play game but the payment is only calculated to satisfy hosting servers and us as full-time developers. For the moment, we both are students in Software engineering and  Network and telecommunication graduating next year."
hp72e0,Rimworld-like Zombie survival game sim.,"Rimworld like scavenging game where you move from town to town looking for pawns and scavenging resources. You either stay on the move forever or settle down on one of the towns to defend against hordes. Mid game has Missions that include raids from other colonies and zombie hordes, Scavenging missions for increasing research and resources, and rescue missions. Late game either has politics or become a tower defense with stricter resource management for flamethrowers, guns, and trap/time repair/rearm. Victory condition might be a consecutive number of Raid/horde survived. If Raids not survive, you go back to nomadic early game. Floating Victory condition can also be found in a random city/town/zone/area for vaccine research. Defeat condition is only zero colony survival rate."
hp4cu6,Does anyone have any simple game ideas,I want to start making games in unity but I have hardly any experience with making games what is a simple game I can make
hp47gp,A rogue-like game like Dead Cells where you play as Hero for a kingdom which revolves around music.,"So basically you start out in a world where a kingdom which is built around music is currently being attacked by a Demonic Race from a neighbouring country. You get appointed to slay the King to stop the war by your old King who built the kingdom ages ago. Gameplay is similar to Dead Cells but the weapons used are instruments w/ a rhythm system for juicy combos.\nEach instrument is played differently and the more you play only one instrument the more you master and upgrade your skills with it. So basically the more you progress the more Ancient Tablets you obtain which gains you the truth about both Kingdoms. And during the battle with the Demon King you find out that Music from the Kingdom is actually made to hurt the Demons, who has very high sound sensitivity. And your quest was all just a ploy from your King to conquer the other Kingdom, so yeah the final boss is your king lol."
hp33bj,The best damn driving simulator you've never played,"imagine a game that puts you in the hot seat for any action movie. ponder this setup to mission: intro scene shows classic bank robbery. the cut scene of this robbery finishes with your character and your accomplices getting into a getaway car. Now you start to play. The cars are real cars like in forza, assetto corsa, project cars etc. Your job is to get away. basically a real life get away from police, gang bangers, whoever. cites don't have to be real, bu the concept is to take the getaway driver scene from every action movie you've ever seen and put those ideas into a driving simulator with full controller AND steering wheel support. there should definitely be a mixture of missions between real life getaways and some cinematic stuff like smashing through fruit stands or driving hyper cars between buildings in dubi. Think about Assetto corsa gameplay, with GTA type missions where you drive like you cant in real life. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthis all comes from the fact that i really want to get into a police chase in a fast car for the fun of ""you cant catch me"" but i also dont want to go to jail and lose my license. there isnt a game like this available for any driving simulator, it would be fun"
hoyz1t,A game about a person after going through a war,"War changes people, usually not for the better. I feel like more people should get to chance to experience that through a game form.

hoy7rd,An Isometric RPG where you play as an inmate in an intergalactic prison-ship,"Think Sci-fi prison break, except the prison is the most dangerous society known on any galaxy. You play as a new inmate who must find a way to survive.\n\nYou basically have to form connections with people/groups of different kinds and species, while conforming to the prison schedule. Everything you do is being watched, so the player must be careful what they d lo and where they do it."
houqve,Rogue-like CRPG - Lovecraftian Setting,My basic idea is to make a CRPG game where the player scales a dungeon with procedurally generated rooms. You could find different characters and relics along the way to help you as well as the possibility of finding quests or one time events.\n\nThe you'd be able to control parties of up to 4 and travers battlefields that would be simple rooms laid out in a Procedural death labyrinth fashion. The combat would hopefully match games like Baulders Gate or PoE. \n\nThe setting would be somewhat Lovecraftian along the lines of a darkest dungeon but with a more modern twist.
hor8qx,TPS vs RTS,"Recently, I saw  Starship Troopers - Terran Command announced on Steam for 2020. It reminded me of this game I played a long time ago called BattleSwarm: Field of Honor. It came out in 2010. Basically, there is 2 side but they have a different game genre. The Marines would be like a third-person survival game where you defend your base and the Bugs will be like StarCraft. The game has flaws and was shut down. Haven't found a game that was similar since."
hopbf2,an actually helpful idea.,"i have always disliked that armor is just some clothing that you put on. i want to make a game where armor is a physical thing that goes over clothes, with each piece having it's own durability, like forearm, lower chest, upper chest, upper back, lower back, stuff like that. if just one piece of the armor breaks, then only that part of your body is exposed. you still are armored everywhere else. if you have no armor but happen to have some scrap metal and rope, then you can select which body part you want to cover and craft basic covering, which is just weak armor made to help get you through a little bit."

hogc4p,"Not an idea for a whole game, but for a mechanic","You know how in a lot of games you're given rare items that should be used in moderation? (Like bombs in most dungeon crawler games or powerful potions in rpgs) I think that many people hoard those items like dragons, and never end up using them.  My idea is that in the final fight/boss of a game, the difficulty (or even ending) of that fight depends on how many you have, so if you hoarded those items you get the satisfaction of using them and if you wasted them then the boss would be harder, but less satisfying, maybe a true or secret ending could be found if the player used those items within a certain range of times."
hoeu33,explosions should act like explosions.,"in a lot of video games, if your character is caught in an explosion, it's not that bad. will your health deplete a bit? yes, but you will be able to heal most of the time. i think explosives in video games should be realistic, reducing your walking speed drastically, making it very hard to hear, and just overall making it extremely hard to walk away alive, like in real life."
hodnsn,immersive tutorial ideas.,"so I'm thinking there's a few ways a tutorial could be immersive and completely in character.\n\n1:the robot\n\n""ah, you're finally functional, now i know you must be confused by the fact that you just now started existing but, don't worry, that's normal for an AI like you, here, get up, I'll show you the ropes, lets see what you're capable of""\n\n2:the amnesiac\n\n""so you're finally awake, you might feel disoriented by your mental trauma and all that, but whether or not you remember anything, we should still try to get you back up on your feet, I've prepared some basic physical therapy for you.""\n\n3:the soldier\n\n""wake up soldier! its time for bootcamp! we'll whip you up in shape and make sure you'll be running straight to the battlefield in no time!""\n\n4:the hangover\n\n""ugh, my head is killing me, where am i? oh right, I'm in bed, i must've been drinking last night, i can barely stand up. maybe i should take it slow this morning, now lets see if i can remember how to walk.\n\ni think these are a few ideas on how to make tutorials that provide some immersion and maybe even some humor to your playthrough."
hobyif,Deckbuilding instead of talent trees &amp; cooldown skills in (for example) WOW or Diablo style games,"This is a game idea but also a question of whether or not something like this already exists.   Either a game like WoW or a Diablo style game I think could incorporate deckbuilding rather than fixed slot skills.   So, one question would be how and when your hand would be replaced, and another would be, would it be too difficult to keep track of a randomized hand for quick combat bindings..  \n\nAnyways, I'd like to see something like this..  Anyone else?"
hoafsr,A cross between the Sims and FTL,"I love the game FTL, but I wish there was more emphasis on character creation and development, as well as daily life on a ship. I love shows like Star Trek and Firefly which have really well-written crew members. I'd love if they did a game like FTL, but with really robust character customization like in the Sims. You could create them from how they look to how they act, and the game would be you going around taking jobs and having adventures, but during space travel you could have your characters do stuff like focus on hobbies, interact with each other, and so on."

It's a rough idea and needs fine tuning but I think it will work if someone is interested in the idea"
ho73i4,Come up with a game mechanic based on the farms in Minecraft but has a few new twists to make it more interesting,"Think of the ridiculous contraptions people build in Minecraft to farm mobs and animals -- but if those complicated redstone mob farms were expanded into the whole game, and were more visually intuitive."
ho52oy,Stardew Valley or Animal Crossing in space,"Hi, I have an idea of game like Stardew Valley or Animal Crossing but in space environment, and in my head I see it not just like similar gameplay on another planet but like growing plants or building house just in space, for example on asteroids or small planets, where you need to move between them on your spaceship, what do you think about that?"
ho22be,A game about that one nameless soldier who appears less than one or two minutes then die in an apocalyptic horror movie,"I got that idea from that one scene in the *Gyo Tokyo Fish Attack* OVA where that one soldier in a gas mask is being surrounded by bloated fish people on spider tanks before its cuts, leaving you a idea of his fate.\n\nI can't think of a lot of apocalyptic movies with a military focus, you're always following people like you and I watching the world we know going to shit. What if you played a infected apocalypse game where you don't play as your usual horror protagonists who hopefully make it out alive through a lot of plot armor. Instead, you're that nameless, faceless soldier we commonly see but know nothing about except for the fact that he received instructions and is following them. You don't have loved ones you're trying to get to from the other side of the country (or at least, none that we know of), you're not carrying the cure to save mankind, you were just sent to clean the area. Now the situation has gone out of control and you have to find your way back to base or just get the hell out here, wherever the path you take may lead.\n\nThere have probably already been games like that, but I want to talk about the thematic around the protagonist. The sense of anonymity behind the character, with nothing outstanding about him is what I find interesting. No background. No backstory. No face reveal. No supporting cast - except maybe control if you can reach them. The characterization goes as far as what you would see in one of zombie movies - ""It's dangerous out there! Get out of he-\*dies\*"". You're not even the marine who's going to defeat the hell invasion all by himself because apparently, you were the only one in your squadron competent enough to not die. You're just an extra, a nobody who we can at best assume enrolled to serve his country and is now trying to make it out of this hellhole.\n\nA slow-paced, camera-over-the-shoulder gameplay like in the Resident Evil 2 remake would probably suit the concept best, but, despite being a trained soldier, you would get a dramatically worse feel of isolation and vulnerability. You're not going have a wide range of weaponry. No grenade launcher, no flamethrower and definitely no bazooka. You'll have your rifle, your pistol and a few grenades at best ; ammo is limited so you'll soon realize you got to pick your fights, instead of going all trigger happy and burning through your precious ressources. You could even apply a rogue mechanic, reflecting how easily your character can be sent off as a narrative device to build a sense of danger.\n\nA few additions:\n\n\- While trying to survive, you could encounter some of the few survivors and the next four things to happen: (1) You try to escort them to safety (2) You ponder whether or not the physically and/or mentally damaged are worth dragging or best left to die - or even put out of their misery. (3) You eliminate them because they show signs of infection - why not even shoot any person on sight just to be safe? (4) You leave them because you don't need a bunch of civilians on your case when you're trying to save your skin.\n\n\- Zombies are overdone. Body horror is where it's at."
hny8b0,"A game where you can't see the player, only the level.","The basic idea is that it's a 1-screen platformer where you can't see the player, only the level design. To have an idea of where you are, the game produces different notes depending on your x and y location. You can click anywhere on screen to know what sound your character would make if it was at this location. There might be places where you can only know your x location or y location, or none of them (for example, the notes are replaced with drum sounds or something). \n\nI actually made a prototype like this years ago using Scratch : https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/230138122/ . (A final product might have a different kind of sound design, like two distinct sounds for the x and y axis instead of having the notes go faster, but the idea stays the same) \nThere's supposed to be a part where the notes are replaced with drum sounds, but sadly it's broken.\n\nI'd love to know your thoughts on this!"
hnxr9b,Everyday Fighters,"Had this idea a couple years ago, thought I'd share.\n\n2D side view fighting game, like Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter, but you play as an ordinary person, but with extraordinary moves.\n\nImagine one fighter who is someone you may see at an airport rolling two suitcases behind them. They swing them like hammer attacks, and a special attack is stuffing their opponent into one of the cases and just abusing the hell out of it.\n\nOr a boss that's a cheer squad and you have to beat a half-dozen opponents at once while dodging the sports players they're summoning."

hnvj2m,A game where you MANAGE an ALIEN HIVE,"Hi guys,\n\nSo, I had this idea today that I’ve been developing. It’s a game where you have to administer a hive of intelligent alien insects that came from a tiny meteor that fell on earth around the 1800s.\n\n\nThe genres should be:\nSimulation\nResource Management\nDecision-Making\n\n\nFor the simulation and resource management part, it should be clear that your main goal is to make the insects species thrive, in the ways that you see fit. The insects will evolve depending on the choices you make for the hive, and on the surroundings where the meteor first landed.\n\nYou want aggressive insects that are really tribalistic and feed themselves in other species? Go ahead!\nBut just know that you’ll need to either make “farms” for food or turn into a nomadic species.\n\nYou want to be peaceful and self sustained, with insect machines that run on...(idk this part yet, but some weird tiny insect technology)?\nOkay!\nBut just know that predators are more likely to attack your hive, because you’re not really aggressive. So you should spend resources in creating defense tiny insect machines.\n\nThose two should be some of the many choices you can make. As said, things like where the meteor fell in the world should influence too.\nAnd there should be even when humans discover this new insects species.\nIf you are more peaceful or in a secluded place, you should be fine for some time, but if you end up near a city or just turn to be really aggressive, humans will notice you much quicker.\nAnd the whole plot from when the humans discover your species will either be:\n\nThey’ll try to attack your hives because you’ve been destroying the ecosystem and is fucking up their farms.\n\nOr they’ll capture you for study, and deplete your resources after finding out your goods.\n\nSo in this case, if the humans come and you don’t have the necessary defenses, that’s game over.\nBut, if you can defend yourself, either from having really tough insects with venom and hard exoskeletons, or by having those weird tiny insect machines that can defend the hive, you should be good to go.\n\n\nThe endgame should be your species fully spread in the world, by bringing devastation or by just coexisting with everyone with your weird tiny insect technology.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you guys can’t understand something, just comment or DM me and I’ll try to explain."
hnuzuy,A game about being a wartime reporter,"So basically, there's a conflict unfolding in some city. (I envisioned stuff like Desert Storm and Iraqi Freedom when thinking about it), and you are a reporter. Essentially, the war will continue moving along at a fixed pace, in different areas around the city. You get a camera and a journal, and a free pass to most of the city (but not everywhere ;) ). You can run around the city and choose what to record and report. Maybe you could also attach to a platoon, following them around and documenting their actions. I feel that choosing what to record and show the outside world could make for some interesting scenarios, maybe a multiple ending type scenario."
hnt390,a game about being a child home alone with nightmares.,"so i just came up with this idea randomly, this is a game where you are a child that was left home alone so your parents could have some fun time somewhere else, and you have to stay home by yourself for a week.\n\nas a child you have to take care of your basic human needs.\n\nbladder:you're potty trained, so you can just use the toilet\n\nhunger:the fridge is stocked, so go there and either just eat whats there or try to cook a meal.\n\nentertainment:you need something to pass the time lest you die from boredom, so watch some tv, play with your toys, or mingle with the family dog.\n\nsleep:pretty simple, sleep in the bed when you can, but you might have some nightmares and trouble sleeping, and theres only so much sleep medicine around the house.\n\nso one of the main mechanics is that you start seeing things and having worse nightmares, things around you will start to look scarier, the door to door salesman starts to look like a monster that wants to eat you, the family pet looks scarier, and everything gets worse.\n\nessentially the game turns from survival to survival horror."
hnpsho,a short game about being brave.,"so in this game you will control a hand with your mouse and be put into many different situations where there is a percieved danger, and you will have to do certain things or be called a ""chicken"". it would be a bit like warioware perhaps where the different things are a bit like minigames where you have to overcome your fear and gut feelings to win.\n\nwhat do you think?"
hno9sh,Tower defense/Cooking simulator,"Just like a normal tower defense game, like Minworld and Creeper World but the core resources are ingredients like pasta and meat, and the advanced resources would be spices like salt, sugar and cinnamon. The tower is the pan(s) necessary for what food you're making.\n\nAll levels would be pre-made and kitchen-like. The enemies would be dust (low level) and bugs (high level)"
hngj0n,Tarot city sim game,"It's a turn-based city sim game, but set in a magic land. You can build buildings, which yield or cost resources every turn :\n\n* Farms yield food.\n* Houses yield inhabitants, and Dust. Costs food.\n* Libraries yield knowledge. Costs Dust.\n* Shrines yield piety. Costs Dust.\n* Covens yield culture. Costs Dust.\n\nThere is a tree of technologies (for knowledge), beliefs (for piety), and policies (for culture). Depending on how you choose them, you have different builds allowing different special building and ressources buffs. For instance, you can build an autocratic theocracy, allowing you to build churches (better shrines), but reducing culture income.\n\nOnce you have enough of the above ressources, you can craft a tarot card, the first card of your deck. It gives you a production bonus. You then have three choices when pressing next turn :\n\n1. Keep the same card and keep its bonus. The price of this option rises exponentially as you select it.\n2. Craft a new random card and add it to your deck, losing the bonus of the current card. The price of this option decreases exponentially as you select option 1. You can craft a card you already own.\n3. Draw a card from your already existing deck. This option is free.\n\nThe bonus from the card depends from its suit.\n\n* The Swords gives you a knowledge income bonus.\n* The Cups gives you a piety income bonus.\n* The Pentacles gives you a Dust income bonus.\n* The Wands gives you a culture income bonus.\n* The Major Arcanae grants you special buildings &amp; buffs.\n\nYou win the game when you have a full deck.\n\nWhat do you think about it ? How would you flesh it out ?"
hnf7ix,First post,"So my idea is basically a horror setting, and your only light source is one of those torches that you need to keep cranking in order to generate light, a way you could do this is to make it so the player has to keep spamming a button to keep the light on"
hnf2n0,Space Exploring RPG,"I would need some help with mechanics if any of you would help (also any name ideas would help) , here is what I have so far:\n\nBeginning: You hear a loud crash, where are you, you think. Your ears start to hurt, your head is spinning. You don’t remember who you are, where you are, and why you are there.\n\nSo pretty much the first quarter of the game you spend exploring outer space, looking for materials to fix your ship (you can also find bits and pieces of a destroyed journal, more on that later), after you are done the ship automatically tracks a route to the nearest planet (no name yet).\n\nYou crash land and the spaceship blows up, on that planet there is a weak atmosphere and almost no gravity, it seems deserted for the most part. There are quite a few animal species, you must find ways to survive and build up a new spaceship from what scrap you have. After you a are done you basically find out what happened to you: You were one of the few testers for new hyperspeed spaceships back on planet Earth but you steered out of control and entered a black hole, in that black hole was a giant rock and you crashed against the rock making you lose half of your ship.\n\nIt seems since you were in that black hole 80 years have passed on earth and everyone you knew has died, you decide to live among the stars and explore the vast open space."
hnb02z,Blade Runner inspired shooter,"A battle royal. Please don’t click off and just stick with me trust this is a unique take! So the main components that make this special are;\n\n1: A emphasis on parkour. Wall running, wall climbing, wall jumping, jump rolling and a jet pack that can be used to glide around on a short fuel reserve that refuels soon touching the ground.\n\n2: New art style. Similar too blade runner, the map would contain large cities similar to war zone, but also farms and beaches.\n\n3: Once again similarly to war zone there would be a money system. You could find money around the map or by completing contracts that could be used at shop stations to get exclusive passives, abilities and health.\n\n4:  Storage. There would be a hot bar with three spaces. These three spaces could contain either abilities or health items but weapons, ammo, money, crafting materials(more later) and passives would be stored separately. Abilities would be grenades or stuff similar too apex. Abilities would have cool downs but health would not. Crafting materials, would be a rare resource which each player would spawn with but other then that would be very hard to find. Finding anvils around the map or using the portable anvil ability could be used to upgrade weapons power. Passives are found and you can only have three.\n\n5: Unique mode(this is where the blade runner inspiration comes in). It would be a race to get the most money and escape on a helicopter however the difference is that there are robots on the map. Robots would act exactly like humans and humans wold be rewarded for killing them, however if a humans kills a human they would become wanted and humans who kill them would be awarded money. While this sound easy, robots would tea bag and try to make friend with humans before killing them so it would be hard to distinguish.\n\nI mean, i speed wrote this on my phone so there are probably lots of errors but I couldn’t be bothered to edit and I have a lot more ideas (but don’t like reading longs texts so I’m not gonna draw this out) but tell me what you think!"

hn658c,a game about denial.,"in this game you play as a woodcutter and fisherman working at the outskirts of honeywood (same person with both those skills) who relies on these skills to keep his family warm and fed in these cold winter nights, but as you will discover, the truth is far from that.\n\nthe gameplay is simple, you have a food, meter, and a warmth meter, you chop wood to make and fuel campfires, and catch fish to cook and eat.\n\nthe story however, is the interesting part.\n\nthroughout the game there will be a narration made by the character you play as, talking about how much he cares about his family and such.\n\none day a visitor comes, he starts trying to tell the woodcutter that his life is a lie, that he has no family. this starts to make sense as in the actual gameplay you don't ever see his family and you are just making campfires outside and eating the fish yourself. at first the woodcutter denies this, but eventually he has to accept the truth\n\nthe game ends with the woodcutter either leaving this place he was trapped in before by his own delusions, or lapsing back into denial, and still pretending he has a family, this is represented by the player either interacting with the newly available path or going back to the campfire and resting again at it.\n\nand this is my idea, let me know what you think."

In the first three rounds  the vehicles are unaccessible and the objective is to build up cash for the fourth round where the map opens up and vehicles are allowed but you have to buy them using the cash accumulated from the the previous rounds, from then on the game plays like conquest. Any fortifications/enviroment destruction from the previous rounds stays around, depending on who won the previous rounds teams may have advantages/disadvantages like mainly more cash allowing them to be more flexible or if they won on a part of the map with a comm station they would get information (for example if a point was captured) faster"

hmrpvi,A Location to location rogue like survival,"beginning of the game idea:  \nso, you wake up in a bunker, where a woman is waking you up, she wont have much of any clue whats going on either, but will explain that this is the third room she's come to. you'll find yourself in a bunker that only has a few items, which she'll want you to collect and bring, she'll then lead you out, and you'll discover you're in a big area with a wall surrounding it, there's one entrance way and it seemingly leads to freedom but she tells you not to go out yet (will have to work on why game wise and stuff) but you'll find a few resources here and there, you got a crafting system and a fairly small inventory space, but can equip armor better backpacks and weapons. she'll showcase she has a shotgun (or any gun really) but that she didn't find any ammunition so it's more so for intimidation. (she may have used it to intimidate you earlier)  \n\n\nDescription of game concept:  \nessentially the game itself is where you are in a large room that looks like walls were just built around a random location (sorry hard to explain) and you'll find resources in these rooms, but you have to be careful not to stay in the same place for too long as each night creatures attack, and every night they get progressively stronger and more in numbers. so you've got to collect valuable resources, craft what you can as fast as you can, and then move on to the next room, which again I've got to work on (perhaps they'll be a portal and the creatures come from the portal? or maybe it is just an open door but when you leave monsters are out there between each location?) you can occasionally find others as sometimes you'll find a bunker, which will always have some rarer loot and sometimes another survivor, they'll join your party and you can venture around with them, they can die, and take up resources to feed and drink so you'll have to be careful not to have too many but to keep some around for protection.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nand that's basically it, I don't really have any ideas yet on an overall story outside of just surviving as long as you can, loot and locations can be randomly generated, you can have a list of people you can run into and have it randomly generated if they show up in the rooms you come across making it a rogue like survival game.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd think it could do well as an indie game similar to Stranded, but with more emphasis on moving from place to place and setting traps, and building/finding better weapons and such.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(perhaps some survivors offer special benefits such as being craftsmen of certain trades that allow more advanced crafting options?)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nbut anyway, sorry for the rambling, just woke up and it was fresh on my mind and I didn't want to lose the concept of it, Idk what to do with this concept as I'm not an indie developer, and don't really plan on going out of my way to develop this game, but I would really like to see it made someday, somehow."
hmqy7c,Grand strategy like Civ but 'better' or more granular,"Take the entire base concept of the Civilization series and through it through a bunch of windows made of glass molten together from the lens of a self-proclaimed history buff. Not even necessarily a good one at that.\n\nI'd like to start with my inspiration: The comment section of a YouTube video. Quite rare to see even the slightest spec of a valuable contribution to a discussion on *any* topic in that corner of the internet. Although I suppose that was supplemented by ^(just a teeny bit of firsthand knowledge on this topic), research motivated by dissatisfaction with elements of certain games aiming to emulate history using a contemporary view coupled with universally applied mechanics that have a tendency to be (for lack of a better term)... erroneous ~~(since that's the perfect description)~~.\n\nFor a bit of a basic overview;\n\n|Aspect or Mechanic|Mechanic/Description|Desc. or Desc. Cont.|Reasoning|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Name|Triumphant|Do I really need a description here?|It's the name of the game, moral of the story, motion of the ocean, theme of the novel, \_ aaaaannd it's gonna be the hook for all the ads.|\n|Scope|Timespan|Should cover most of human history, ranging from Paleolithic to the end of the Neolithic. Of course I don't mean time should be measured in smaller units like days or God forbid hours. The passage of time can be measured in far more efficient ways which I... am totally 100% capable of thinking of at this very moment.|Size: It matters. Focus on the ~~big things in life~~ consequential events in human history from a perspective with hindsight.|\n|Difficulty Settings|Make the ""era"" you start in adjustable in difficulty settings. Being ""Neolithic"" in the ""Paleolithic"" will give you and your people a distinct advantage over others.|\-|What else would you propose?|\n\nWith that done, let's dive right in. It's essentially a grand strategy where you lead the people, or part of the people of a specific historical civilization to global dominance through various means. Colonialism, world hegemony, and economic supremacy (easiest by redirecting trade) to name a few. You need not rule over an entire civilization, but the goal is rather to bring yours to prominence and in the end game; preeminence.\n\nThe intro sequence or ads will always end with something along the lines of ""Do you have the wit and grit needed to dominate the planet? Over millennia, many have struggled for a place in the sun, a time of prosperity and prominence for their people, but in the end, only one can reign triumphant.""\n\n...Too on the nose?\n\nObviously draws inspiration from CIV, EU, CK, AoE, among others, and will likely end up with some parallels. I'd avoid borrowing though. Why copy an existing structure when you can make a new, better one? Well, ""better"" in the sense it more closely meets my intentions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTimespan: Spans millennia. This may be a problem.\n\nTime Periodization: Whenever significant developments with wide-ranging effects take place, time will separate itself to create a new ""era"" starting from the year in the catalyst that caused those events took place in and periodize the preceding years into its own ""era"".\n\nTech Tree: Each ""era"" has its own unique ""advancements"". Advancements can be technological, cultural. These are flexible and the deciding factor for which advancements are available in each era are a variety of achievements pertaining to the political climate of a ""stage"" of that era. The first stage, being ground zero, serves as the formative years for an ""era"" with the leading realms or nations of the day deciding the main advancements that will characterize an era for future generations studying it in class or various circles.\n\nThese ""core advancements"" will present itself as an overarching theme and serve as a basis for widespread, transformative societal change.\n\nNot everything that can be deemed an advancement will be displayed as such. Minor advancements will inevitably come as a result of a major, more detrimental advancement, or a combination of them. For example, the First Agricultural Revolution as a ""major advancement"" (being a detrimental development in human history, which possibly warrants its 'discovery' marking the start of an era) will give way to minor advancements like primitive irrigation. Minor advancements like these will not be available in the sort of ""tech tree"" this game uses, but it is instead up to a diverse array of intellectuals within one's intelligentsia to piece it together, either assembling as a group or working independently. Players or AI can influence this by sponsoring these efforts by offering financial support or even organizing a systemic cultural shift in favor of the effort (that's another thing btw) and subsidizing an entire sector dedicated to it.\n\nThat's another thing that should be implemented. Society and culture. These are two of the most important concepts for humankind as an ""advanced"" species to grasp, and they are integral to both our modern world as well as Þe Olden Days. As a mechanic, these two should decide what governments and economies are available to a specific country/realm, with the sole exception of a special event for when ideological theories are introduced and entice the creation of a movement. Countries can share the same society/culture, as they often did in previous centuries where they transcended borders but as of now rarely do, thanks in part to the concept of the ""nation-state"". That ""theory"" is then placed in ""developing mode"" where it can be influenced (or, if you have mana to spend, edited outright) to your heart's content. Players cannot construct their own\n\nAs for mana; **LIMIT IT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE**. Mana is supposed to be an basic assessment of a not so integral mechanic but in reality tends to be terrible, horribly arbitrary gross oversimplification of concepts such as influence or even entire economies that are given a magical number to trade around with for benefits or, in high numbers, give benefits by themselves. Which is a shame since mana could work by being decided by various factors like the assessment of a country's wealth, raw strength, and yes, even power (in its sense as a general term) instead of button clicking.\n\nOh and the ""systemic cultural shift"" I mentioned earlier? INTRODUCING ""MOVEMENTS"": Movements can be supported by the player and spurred on while still in their infancy. They can also be suppressed, emboldened or empowered, and fizzle out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAn example of all this working out in the so-called tech tree;\n\nEVENT 1: \[Marxist\] Thought has been introduced by \[ideologue\], \[Karl Marx\], published in \[The Communist Manifesto\]. As an ideological theory it \[being Marxism\] covers the \[struggle and perceived oppression of the worker archetype in our society and concludes that sweeping changes are necessary to ""liberate"" the poorly defined adhesive body deemed the working-class\]. This theory holds stances and viewpoints generally considered to be \[Left-wing\] from a political standpoint.\n\nOur options are either suppress the movement, which may end up backfiring and producing sympathy; ignore the movement, which may end up generating opposition to it; or support the movement, which will guarantee the establishment of a counter-movement. We can choose to suppress this movement by attacking its popularity with a particular socioeconomic class, say the intellectual elite or legislators, or produce propaganda which will affect everyone's perception. We can choose to support this movement by increasing its popularity with a particular (so forth), or suppressing its counter-movement.\n\nIf \[title of leader\] develops sympathies for the movement \[if there is a legislative body, ""and/or if \[name of legislative body\] supports it""\], it's demands can be enacted, though their implementation can be more moderate or radical than most supporters intended. If this does not happen, a coup or revolution may follow.\n\nEvent 2: By accepting \[Marxist\] Thought as a credible theory, we can influence or outright bend its continued development to our will. Economic models (and their respective ""school"" if applicable) are; \[[Bolshevik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolsheviks)/[Leninist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leninism): [Marxist-Leninist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism%E2%80%93Leninism)/[Maoist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maoism), [Trotskyist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trotskyism), RevSoc: [Agrarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_Revolutionary_Party), [Syndie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndicalism), [Orthodox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary_socialism), Communism: [Anarcho-Communist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-communism), [Orthodox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism#Marxist_communism), Uncategorized: [Menshevik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mensheviks), [Spartacist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spartacus_League), etc.\]. They have the following array of economic models; \[[State Capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_capitalism), [State Socialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_socialism), Socialism, and Communism\] always available for \[the title of leader or legislators is there is a legislative body\] to choose. Lastly governments; \[[DemSoc (Modern)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_socialist), [Soviet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_(council))/[Council Communism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_communism), [AuthSoc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authoritarian_socialism)/[""Barracks Communism""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barracks_communism)/[Dictatorship of the Proletariat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictatorship_of_the_proletariat), and [Deformed workers' state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformed_workers%27_states)\], some of which will be locked in for a specific ""method"". Military organization; \[Unrestricted, If Marxist-Leninist or Stalinist and ""Socialism in One State"" has developed in light of global hostile reactionary movements and there being only one socialist state; an extensive standing army, Otherwise ""workers' battalions"" or some form of militia of ideologues\].\n\nOr, more simply...\n\nProponents of the \[Welfare State\] believe sweeping legislative reforms are necessary to \[alleviate grievances by uplifting those who cannot go on without the aid of their community. We are only as strong as our weakest link.\]\n\nAn alternative could be \[[Social State](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Socialism_(Germany)). Let us not antagonize ""the workers"" into forming a permanent movement threatening to derail order and cohesion and destroy our very way of life.\] The only sensible defense from thine enemy is to defang them. Take away their ammunition and what are they really left with? (Must have counter-movement: Anti-\[Social/Communism)\n\nUpdate Coming Soon"
hmo9ul,"A fighting game where every character has two movesets, their normal one and their Evil one","The fighting game's story involves some type of magic/dimensional event/whatever divide all the characters of this world into their more heroic side and their more evil side. The story isn't really relevant to the idea, since it's in service of the concept. Every character has a variant which twists their abilities into two distinct and opposing playstyles.\n\nHeroic movesets are the 'standard', in fighting game terms. They're skill-focused and involve the application of the game's basic mechanics, like most fighting games' entire cast, more or less.\n\nEvil movesets are the exact opposite. They're light on mechanical skill, but involve much more employment of mind games, prediction, and mixing up. They're often disjointed, and sometimes even gimmicky.\n\nThe game could even go so far as to have the standard online game mode be to match the two styles against each other every time, to sort of enforce the idea of pitting the two styles of play against each other."
hmnoen,Looking for a team to start a new game!,"Trying to make some connections on designing a game.

I have a brilliant idea, ran it past a BioWare producer and he enjoyed the thought and idea. But, BioWare is not looking to expand their game types anytime soon. Although, he said he would be willing to consult with me if I put in some ground work. \nIf this interest you in anyway, feel free to shoot me a message."
hmnfwu,Food Fighters,"A multiplayer fighting game with a twist. The title may be a little misleading; perhaps somebody could come up with a better one.\n\nIt isn't set in a cafeteria or food court. It doesn't involve flinging your lunch tray at teenagers.\n\nThoughts:\n\n* Imagine a larger version of the Iron Chef kitchen stadium, but with whacky/cartoonish aesthetic. This stadium doubles as a kitchen and a battle arena. There could be a variety of these stadiums to select from.\n* Players would select from a variety of silly chef characters. The short fat guy with a huge mustache, the little old grandma, the backyard BBQ dad, the Stepford wife, etc.\n* Each match would be broken up into two phases. The first part of the match is a timed cooking competition, very similar to Iron Chef. A randomized list of ingredients are generated at the beginning of the first phase, and every chef must use those ingredients to cook up a variety of different food items. Rather than being graded on your culinary skills... the food items you prepare are used as weapons and armor for the second phase of the match. Once the bell rings to indicate the end of phase one, the mounted cooking equipment rolls away (wall sections rotate to hide ovens, floor sections rotate to hide preparation counters, etc) and cooking utensils are sucked onto a giant magnet that descends from the ceiling. Now the chefs must fight to the death. Whack opponents with a baguette. Fling flaming meatballs at your foes. Stun enemies with a pie to the face. Defend yourself with a sausage link shirt (chainmail) and a pizza shield.\n* When preparing food for the upcoming fight, it makes sense to overcook things a little bit. After all, you want your pizza shield crust to be tough and your baguette baton to be hard. However, you'll have to be careful not to overcook things too far, or undercook them. If you overcook your pizza shield, it may crumble faster (take less damage). If you undercook your baguette, it may act more like a floppy pool noodle, dealing little to no damage.\n\nThat's all I've thought through so far. Mechanically, I guess the cooking would have to be achieved through minigames. I imagine the fighting system would be similar to Soulsborne games, or perhaps like For Honor. You could also go the Dynasty Warriors or Devil May Cry route. Optimally, though, I envision this game in VR. VR could make the first phase much better, having to physically cook things.\n\nThoughts? Suggestions?\n\nThanks for reading!"
hmmiw3,a stealth game about your identity deteriorating.,"so in this game you play as a personnel in an organization, a personnel specialized in study and research, a scientist, a nerd. one day you end up seeing something you shouldn't, and now you need to get out.\n\nyou start out with a positive reputation, but over time due to your escape plans and deteriorating mental state (from the aforementioned forbidden knowledge) you start to get negative reputation and eventually end up a known rogue with the entire team of staff hostile to you.\n\nas a nerd you are weak, but have access to utility items and abilities, such as id cards, hacking, chemistry, map knowledge, etc. you have to outsmart your opponents, which include many armed personnel, who have much more combat training than you.\n\nessentially in the early game you don't need to be that stealthy, only when building up your escape route, but as the game goes on you wont be able to keep up your reputation after a certain point, making it necessary to stay hidden.\n\nthis was my idea, what do you think?"

hml3ch,Open World action MMO,"Just an idea, not working on it, and won't be mad if someone takes and runs with it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNoticed I didn't put RPG. I'm thinking more like GTA, marvel spider-man, cyberpunk (though cyberpunk will be an RPG) type thing. But it's an open-world game with 9 different gangs you can join and leave at will. Each gang will have its own co-op story you can progress through and unique weapons/abilities to unlock. There are also 9 different classes falling under 3 categories. The core gameplay feature will be the open-world events that pit the different gangs against one another (Open-world PvEvP) These events and alliances will change as the overarching story progresses. The main goal of most players would be to unlock all the toys (weapons and abilities) for each class and also outfits and other cosmetics but it would just be like any other open-world sandbox that would give players the freedom to experience the game however way they would like to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat was just the overall concept of the game but I am about to dive into some finer details on these features. First, let's start with the gangs that you will be spending the majority of the game working for. The reason I chose 9 gangs is that each one would be based on the classic D&amp;D alignment chart. Lawful Good, Chaotic Neutral, Etc. There would also be class restrictions on some of the gangs for story purposes like the Chaotic Evil gang consisting of only classes within the Bio category or something like that.  Open-world PvP rules are based on these Gangs. If you are not aligned with any gang you are set as friendly to all other players and cannot be PvPed. But once you have aligned to a gang you will either be friendly to allied gangs, hostile to enemy gangs, and neutral to all other gang members. For Neutral players to PvP they both have to flag up for it while enemy players will already be flagged as hostile no matter what. Players will earn the currency of whatever faction they are flagged for or co-op missions they complete that they can use to unlock weapons/abilities and also vehicles/vehicle upgrades. There will also be bonuses for siding with a gang with fewer playing representing it for open-world content. The bigger the gap between enemy gangs the bigger the bones.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the classes, there are 3 categories for them. Bio, Tech, and Magic. Each Category has 3 different classes (might be best to not lock these 3 classes on character creation and allow swapping in some way) Melee, ranged, and stealth. Each class will have their own weapons and abilities to unlock. You will need to level up and do a promotion quest to unlock more weapons and abilities to purchase. These quests differ depending on the class category. Like for Bio the promotion quest is usually hunting down some mutated beast and for Magic it like a trial you undertake at a temple or shrine. There should be differences between the classes like a Bio melee should have different abilities and weapons than a Tech melee but I haven't really thought of anything yet. I do think for the classes themselves though there should be some checks and balances to that no class really becomes unviable. Something along the lines of the range being the squishiest with a narrow detection field of view but the highest damage output. Meaning a stealth character will have an easier time to sneak up on them and not as much health to burst down. While on the other end melee has the highest health pools and the widest stealth detection. Making it harder to sneak up on them and harder to burst down. And range will have an easier time kiting melee with the damage output to kill them the fastest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow to the core gameplay loop stuff, there will be open world events, co-op missions, and territorial fights. The co-op missions will be the first thing players get accustomed to in the tutorial and are the safest way to progress to those not wanting to PVP and also gives more info about key figures within the gangs and their objectives/ideals. But you gain none of the faction bonuses within these missions and is obviously the slowest way to progress. Open-world events are based on the overarching story that is happening at the time. It doesn't no impact territory control but it is usually the most profitable event and is the most tied into the story itself. And lastly is the territory fights. They usually move the battle lines between the warring gangs. Whichever gang owns a territory will have NPC to back them up in fights with enemy players and also will be able to buy ammo and vehicle within shops within the territory.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust a cool idea I had and thought it'd be fun to post it here. Would love to hear what you all think of it."

Played top-down for traveling the world, then switches to side-scrolling platformer for dungeon crawling and fighting (to allow vertical acrobatics and possibly 'mortal combat' style attacks.) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMagic would exist for the NPCs, but the PC would start with nothing and have to build up skills over time. Some simple guns and explosives could exist, but they'd be very low-tech.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPossibly the main character could fly, thus giving more options to combat as well as fast travel - though I'm not sold on that idea.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe general art style and world would start as horror, with it slowly becoming more adventure as the PC gets more powerful and finds less to worry about.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Story:**\n\nKind of stealing the origin of orcs from Lord of the Rings; the PC is a nameless minion created by magic to serve in an army, essentially cannon fodder to be sent to die against the 'good guys'. Something similar to a goblin or kobold in a way, a very low level creature that is expected to die in combat.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSent on a mission to search for magical super weapons, the main meat of the story would be a character who knows nothing of life beyond fighting going out and exploring a fantasy world. I thought this could open up a few interesting quests and possibly give it a theme of finding the good in the world, rather than being miserable all the time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**There you have it:**\n\nIt's not a great starting point, but right now I'm just tossing around ideas to try and see what's worthwhile. I was hoping people might have suggestions for alterations that could be made, or elements worth/not worth having. Or if the entire thing is garbage.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm semi-experienced with making tiny training games as I learn how to make them, and was looking to try something more complicated to give me a goal to work towards.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you anyone who may have read this far."

If you lose the baby gets to the laser canon at the end and kills you.\n\nLevels: There would be fifty levels each as long as the first level in geometry dash. Every ten levels is spilt into five worlds and on the tenth level of each it is a boss level. These would be smaller arena type maps with canons spread throughout. You have to crush this baby three times before it launches a canon at you.\n\nCustomization: When in a level sparks can be found throughout the map. Crush them to get them. They are the in-game currency and are used to get different designs for the outside spikes of the sun and also different faces and colors."
hmfutf,Loot Based Game,"This is an extremely basic game which is based on the joy of finding new loot. Here is how it works:\n\n\nEach players have exactly 5 items on their characters: Sword, Armor, Helmet, Boots and gloves.\n\n\n\nThere is only 2 different things you can do in the game.\n\n\n\nThe first thing is fight a random player around your rating. If you lose the game, you drop down rating, if you win, you gain rating, and there are leaderboards. The fights are automatics, and are based on your gear.\n\n\nThe second mode is the ""Loot finding"" mode. It actually just generates a random item, which you can choose to replace your current gear with, or not. There is no delay, if you are fast you can literally go throught a bunch of different items really fast.\n\n\nHere is a rough idea of how the item generation works.\n\n\nFirst, it generates base stats for the item. For the sword, the base stat is always attack. The attack value generation follows a loop. Base attack is 100, but you have 75% chance to add 1 to that. If it works, then it loops back into 75% chance to add 1. So in theory, with incredible luck, you could have a 200+ attack sword (no cap), But the majority of generated swords will have attacks in the 100-110 range.\n\n\nSecondly, the sword has a rarity. Uncommon (3 bonus stats), Rare (4 bonus stats) and legendary (5 bonus stats). 90% of items are uncommon, 9% Rare, and 1% Legendary.\n\n\nKeep in mind a common item can easily be much stronger than a legendary item if the base stats are amazing or the legendary gets bad bonus stats.\n\n\n\nThe ""random bonus stats"" can be many different things. It could be poison damage, Bonus life %, armor, etc. All of these stats are also fairly randomized just like the base stats.\n\n\nKeep in mind the game should ideally avoid ""rock paper scisors"" effect where some attributes counter other attributes."
hmeb3c,Online Open-World Superhero Sandbox,"As the title suggests I’ve been thinking about a sandbox type of game with superpowers. Imagine a well-executed combination of GTA Online, Saints Row, and City of Heroes/DC Universe Online. It combines the almost perfect character customization system in City of Heroes, with the missions, mounts, and expansive map of GTA online or Saints Row. \n\nI’ll brainstorm more ideas and post them later."
hmciuv,"A Star Wars strategic action and mechanic simulator game where you lead, fight and repair the Empire's Walkers AT-AT's and AT-ST's","Action gameplay:\n\nA game where you're the leader of a unit using the Empire's different ground vehicles, including lesser known ones. Battles are fought by AI soldiers on the ground and in different vehicles, with you spending most of the time in different vehicles.\n\nBefore the battles you get to make tactical decisions about how you'll be involved in the battles, what vehicles, cooperation with the AI's forces etc, by analysing the terrain, enemy defenses etc. This also changes how the AI fights or plan the attack aswell. Less scripted and more fluid battles should be a major part of the game, with you as somewhere in the middle of a strategic observer (as in a strategic game) and someone fighting in the battle (but very influental).\n\nYou can fight on foot, to complete certain tasks or to abandon a vehicle.\n\nWalking with the legged vehicles can be done ""manually"" to climb over obstacles or especially difficult terrain. This plays like a mini-game where you have to choose your legs placement carefully while keeping the vehicle balanced.\n\nAdditional gameplay: mechanical simulator, RP and ""detective"" gameplay:\n\nGamplay outside of the battles is played on the Devastator Star Destroyer, flagship of Darth Vader, who you'll get to meet at least once. Some of the game play is like that of a mechanical simulator, as you'll spend some relaxing down-time repairing and  maintaining your vehicles, keeping them in good condition - you'll get to know these classic vehicles in intimate detail. If they're too worn out you have to request replacements.\n\nThere will also be a story and RP element aswell, as you try to look after your own men and decide who to trust, as you try to rank up in the Imperial military's terrifying dog-eat-dog pecking order, rotten to the core, and filled with power-hungry psychopaths, framing rivals and being out for themselves. You always feel in danger around most characters in the game. The game shouldn't hold back to show that the Empire is (mostly) filled with really bad guys, and you're one of them. \n\nPerhaps there can also be some detective-style gameplay as you try to find corruption, sabotaurs and spies in the Empire's military, as well as framing your career rivals. An example of corruption could be if some of your vehicles or parts from them ends up mysteriously missing, with a strange paper-trail behind them, as it turns out they were sold to some crime-lord building a personal army.\n\nSometimes vehicles are sabotaged. Maybe there could be a mission on-foot where you personally deal with suspected saboteurs in the production factories."

hm6bu1,"Two ideas: player-created NPCs, and escape-the-matrix afap.","An open world MMO game where you can build and ""train"" your own NPCs. The world would start as completely virgin, then players would spawn in with their first NPC and tell it what to do from a menu of commands like harvest resources, dig, run, hunt, etc. These actions can be done manually, or from the NPC interface's list of commands. Once you have enough resources, you can free form build or use a blueprint to have the NPC build it for you. Or you can use the resources to spawn another NPC. This will give you twice the manpower. This allows you to fill up your area with a bunch of workers each of whom you can control manually, or via scheduled commands. The barren world would quickly look bustling! There are limitations though. Each command has a cost to it. You need to make sure each of your NPCs maintains enough of this ""fuel"" to keep following your command. If the NPC runs out of this fuel, then it will go into a coma. You can still manually control the NPC, you just won't be able to ""program"" it until you have it pick up more fuel. So a command to periodically have the NPC pause working and go into your treasury to fuel up is necessary! You can set a timer, or make a conditional such as ""when fuel is less than 10, walk to treasury, and fuel up"". But the costs are greater for more complex programming so keep it simple! But as long as you have enough fuel, then you can make as many conditionals you want. Fuel can be bought from the game company or other players, or mined from the ground, or stolen from other players' NPCs lol. So you can make an entire city of NPCs each with their own personalities and responsibilities and have them periodically go out trying to conquer other players' NPCs. And obviously make sure your city's treasury doesn't get captured so program your NPCs to defend your city when you're not logged in. For ex, ""if gate not empty, then do id check at gate. if id check greenlist, then ring bell."" You can program it however you want be picking and choosing from your command library. You can add custom commands to your library yourself, or buy new commands from the devs or other players. Bought commands won't reveal the underlying mechanisms so that players won't get their creativity stolen. Plus, it allows for creative backdoors where you could fool another player into buying your Moonwalk Dance command but it has a run way command in it. Then you can just defeat that NPC easily and take its fuel. Obviously, there will be default commands provided by the devs so new players can enjoy the game without customizing their commands but better/cheaper/faster commands will have to be developed or bought to allow for truly infinite possibilities. Theoretically, you'd be able to kickstart a town and it would grow by itself as long as the NPCs can keep harvesting/capturing more fuel and making more NPCs. \n\n- \n\nThe other idea I had came from watching speedruns. This isn't an MMO but a single player game where the main character is stuck in the matrix but doesn't know it at the start but the truth slowly starts to get revealed by seeing glitches and bugs. But the player just thinks the devs screwed up without realizing it until the end that those glitches are part of the game world and he was supposed to utilize them to get a better result. These glitches don't even exist for the first arc, but they keep getting more and more obvious until the end where the character just falls through the map and causes an overflow error in the matrix engine and then exits the matrix to the sound of applause in the real life ballroom where everyone in the audience shows their reaction to the character's performance. The faster the character breaks out of the matrix, the louder the applause. If the character takes too long, then some of the audience already left and the remaining audience curses at him. So here's the catch: the game devs don't program in any glitches into the matrix in the first arc so it should theoretically be impossible for the character to exit the matrix below a certain time. But speed runners are really good at finding unintended glitches so that programmed limit gets beat by them by utilizing the glitches in the actual game to get out of the in-game matrix! And here the audience at the epilogue just goes insane at your character's performance because they don't realize that it wasn't the matrix that had the issue but their reality itself xd. So basically, the game devs make a game for speed runners where the unintended glitches that the speed runners find only add to the immersion!"
hm5ycx,Horror wave survival VR game,"You enter a huge place with weapons scattered from a range of guns, swords, ect. The goal is to survive whatever creatures are in there, wave after wave. As the game goes on, the creatures get progressively more fucked up. From creepy eerie creatures with 2 heads to walking dead zombie babies. Each wave is completely random so there's no consistency with enemies, making the player on edge the whole game. Lights will go out randomly in some rooms and all you'd see are eyes glowing or eerie screams in the distance. \n\nThis is all based on a dream I just had last night. I thought this would be a cool concept for horror fans. This isn't the most detailed idea and I'm sure with even better ideas added to this that this would make one hell of a terrifiying game."
hm3o0j,"An action RPG where you need to learn how to catch and prepare food, so you can earn the title of ""BBQ Master"" for your island.","Hi everyone, at this moment I have an general idea for a game I want to make, but I am not sure if the concept is great enough to actually have a run with it. So I would like to get some feedback!\n\nMy idea is to create a fun and goofy game around mastering the BBQ, where time is your real enemy. Besides learning basics (farming, hunting or fishing), you need to get as much knowledge in X amount of in game hours, before fighting for the title of ""BBQ Master (working title)"". \n\nThe world you live in is all about Food, where inhabitants fight every year in a competition to become the new ""BBQ Master (working title)"" of the island. You play as a young Boy/Girl turning into an adult in a month. Coming from an island where your ancestors continuously won the BBQ Master Title, it is now your turn to bring back that title for your people.\n\nAs you sail off to the big island ""..."" your journey starts. The game is build around learning the basic tools of preparing food, in which you can choose your own direction and play style: \n\n* Are you a Vegan and you like farming games? Go learn from the farming tribe. \n* Do you like hunting and a big Steak on your plate? Start learning from the beefy Meat tribe.\n* Are you more a Fish an Chill kinda player? Go learn from the ocean tribe.\n\nWhile you are learning how to prepare certain types of food, you need to gather items as well. Want to cook something? Go chop some wood and learn how the make fire. As the player you have a backpack which can hold a limited amount of items, which you should take back to your own camp. \*\* As I have a soft spot for actual Combat, I am thinking of applying that as well. Maybe you have dangerous animals while you gather items, or enemies in the wild trying to rob you. \*\*\n\nAs the big day comes near you need to make a selection of your best recipes, which you will cook on the big mountain central at this island. This is where you fight for the Title of BBQ master. \n\nAs I said in the beginning of the post, I have a general idea which I think could be a lot of fun. But I could use some feedback to improve the concept/game play mechanics!"
hm2wim,An rpg class I'm thinking of adding - one that's focused around absorbing monsters,"This class would be the SLOWEST and grindiest class to train. You'd be able to absorb monsters after defeating them. Doing so, you would gain a small portion of their stats.

hm2qm3,Tower Defense Path Mechanic,"I've seen many tower defense games that let you make a path to your 'base' don't let you just block off your base because... well, *duh*. But why? There is no logical reason why you shouldn't be allowed to do this. I propose that you over time generate a resource that you use to build defenses and such but at the end of a level, a resource train as well as building drones come along. The train picks up all leftover resources and pays you for each one, the drones, on the other hand, let you reshape the path eliminating the argument ""Well why can't I just change the path in the middle of a level?"".\n\nI hope you liked my idea!"

hm04u3,Class/Faction based RPG,"I originally imagined this as an MMORPG, but it doesn't need to be.\n\nThe progression throughout the game (the main quest, if you will) is based heavily in your class via a class faction. You start out without selecting your class, and through introductory quests and playing style (casting/melee/stealth, etc), your class is chosen. Shortly thereafter, you are guided toward camps/bases belonging to a larger class faction, eventually becoming a part of the HQ. These installations would be heavily steeped in lore for that group and full of quests that would be characteristic to them. Examples:\n\nAssassin/thief guild: cloak and dagger type quest to get in, and quests involve stealing stuff, assassinations, subversion, espionage, etc.\n\nBlack magic guild: work toward summoning demons, necromancy, doing dirty work for people unwilling to dabble\n\nPaladin guild: advisors to leaders of cities, peacekeeping, etc\n\nOf course there would be quests and dungeons outside of this, but this would be a large part of leveling up, getting gear, and working towards the final boss (or raids if it's an MMORPG). It seems like it would be a more meaningful leveling/progression method rather than doing seemingly random quests. Thoughts?"

ht3act,Universal aiming system,"This idea is not really original, because surely every gamer who transitioned from one fps franchise to another feels the same way. Why don't console games have a universal aiming system for controllers?\n\nIt would make aiming uniform across all games, and make it easier to improve this skill instead of performing well in one game and poorly in another.\n\nI fee that this is more directed towards fps games, but still applies to other genres to some extent.\n\nAnd what is with the input lag in some games that is existent exclusively in consoles? Does it give the hardware more time to render?\n\nDoes steam accomplish this with the steam contoller? Or is it just a configuration tool and the final output is entirely game dependent?\n\nFurther expanation for the skeptics:\n\nIt would require setting a standard and following it in upcoming titles. It won't mean that the impementation would be the same, it would just mean that the output adheres to the standard. So varied game engines won't post much of a hurdle, unless the game engine itself is too stiff that it doesn't support manipulating the way the input is interpreted, or that the manipulation tools are limited; this also is not a huge hurdle, because as the system becomes more popular, the developers will be more incentivised to update their engine to support this feature.\n\nAs a side note, this doesn't mean limiting the developers; it just means providing an additional comfort. In the end, developers can always add another configuration for aiming and toggle between them in a menu option, so the argument that this would limit the developers' ability to provjde immersive gameplay does not really apply here, because the main focus in this discussion is fps shooters. This also does not stop the developers from applying 'filters' to aiming, like for exampe less responsiveness after being hit. \nIt also doesn't mean that the system should be fixed; it is more favorable to adopt a highly customizable comprehensive uniform universal aiming system across all (supporting) games.\n\nAlso, It seems to me that recoil and hit detection are a separate subject. The subject in discussion has to do with how the camera moves in first person, or third, not with  how the game interprets the shooting itself, like hitscan that COD games implement and projectile hit detection that the battlefield franchise adopts.\n\nAnother side subject is that using a 3rd party app or a pluggin to support this feature may be feasible and even favorable in some senarios, but adding compatibility to another peogram is not always doable without changing the engine. So, in my opinion, establishing a standard and utilizing the other mentioned option are both required.\n \nP.S. I am aware that the explanation section is somewhat redundand and superfluous, exept maybe for the feasibility part, but I tried to post this in r/gaming and got 'redeculed' downvoted for not clarifying the idea. I guess I am indeed bad at conveying my ideas"
ht1yfa,Would a throwback open world game be interesting?,"Kinda like how Yakuza feels like a game from 2002 with modern visuals, I wondered if going full throwback and using 2002 visuals and gameplay would work?\n\nObviously there would be high res textures and a lot of the jank would be smoothed out, but it would still very much look like an older open world game.\n\nJust wondered if that’s a thing that could work?"
ht18ru,Rpg looter in a semi survival setting.,"The idea is to take primitive rpg gameplay with borderlands style looting. One open world map with separate dungeon maps perhaps, with an influence on exploration. The game should be beautiful, but not HD, maybe a cartoony feel similar to BOTW.\n I'm imagining a 1 - 4 player game, with unlockable character accessories, likable main characters, a pre-existing story (allowing the players free will without effecting the story line) and maybe an end boss that increases in difficulty with each successful attempt. I'd like the players to have to account for environmental challenges, implying a survival feel without the annoying mechanics usually associated with survival games.\n The idea doesn't feel new, but I've never seen it done exactly like this. Games like botw are annoyingly single player, and lose replayability with only one difficulty increase. And other RPGs focus only on story or skill trees. I have more details written down somewhere as I had planned on doing this myself, but I'm just too slow at learning to code. If anyone is interested in the idea, I could share some of the other mechanics and systems I had thought about. (Inventory, extra storage, a possible base system, procedurally generated weapons and gear, and even the layout of the map)."

hskl0k,Ceiling City,"So this is an idea for a setting with no real plot or gameplay dynamics. Imagine a city that is suspended from the ceiling of a large underground cave. The floor of the cave is obscured by distance fog and probably contains something that will kill you if the fall does not. The residents of the city have made their home in hollowed out stalagmites connected by bridges or in custom built structures anchored to the ceiling\n\nAside from bridges the player can navigate around the city swing spider-man style because there will always be a roof anchor point to latch on to. Combat could occur normally in some places but a quick kill/death can always be triggered by knocking an opponent off the city and into the unknown below. Maybe have arcane magic allowing for floating platforms or some sort of magic rock that falls upward be the core of buildings so that building damage doesn't result in a whole structure falling into the abyss. \n\nPerhaps this would be better as a D&amp;D module, but I wanted to post this here to give any level designers out there some inspiration."

One of his others is an all black suit (like a tux) with the mask and a top hat. \n\nDon't let the ""plague doctor"" part mislead you because he actually does the opposite of what a plague doctor does. He infects people (hence the name ""The Rat""). \n\nHe does so by either throwing poison filled syringes at people like a throwing knife, shooting people with poison tipped crossbow bolts, or just stabbing them with no poison effect. \n\nHe is a protagonist in a story driven game in which once you finish said game, you will then have the option to play through another story where he is the antagonist that you meet some time later."
hsjxfw,A Zelda-like where you have to both rescue the princess and impersonate her,"""Sir knight, this is horrible! The princess has been kidnapped and she's the only thing holding the kingdom together, for she is prophesied to vanquish the evil that encroaches on our lands and lead the world to peace and prosperity. Only you and I know this information, and we cannot allow it to spread, let alone be publicly known. The kingdom would fall into chaos in a matter of days. That's why we need a lookalike at the court until you can find her.\n\nI would have already called one of her doubles, but they're all on maternity leave and you understand it would be even worse if people saw the princess five months in overnight. I was getting worried until I noticed what a perfect specimen of the twink family you are. I'm taking a hard look at you and you would look perfect with one of the princess' dress and a wig.\n\nNow don't look at me like that. Desperate times call for desperate measures. While the princess is away, I need you to impersonate her during the day and fill her royal duties. That includes diplomatic relationships with other kingdoms, attendance to celebrations and inaugurating the swimming pool opening next week. You've spent plenty of time with the princess those last years, so you have no excuse not to get her voice and her personality right. We don't need members of the court to grow suspicious around you, so think before you speak.\n\nWhen do you get to look for the princess in all this? Well, no one dares to interrupt her sleep, so I guess night is the time to head out, look for clues and explore dungeons. Yes, I know, with the schedule of the princess on top of this, you're going to get exhausted pretty quickly and be less efficient both as a princess and a knight. I don't need you to fall asleep in the middle of a dungeon or during the young baron's wedding - you snore so loud, you would be instantly busted. So treat yourself some good nights of sleep once in a while.\n\nImpersonating the princess might sound like a chore to you, but I see in it a way to further our investigation. Building relations might get us information and objects you will need to access certain places and travelling will get us closer to points of interest. Time is limited though, so spend both daytime and night time wisely.\n\nDon't let people see your breast and you should be fine. And if you're gonna to have to marry a prince, at least make sure he's the kind of man the princess would like.""\n\nTL;DR: Zelda has been kidnapped by Ganon, so Impa forces Link into a dress and tells him to look for her at night while pretending to be her during the day in a game that mixes classic Zelda action-aventure with social mechanics *à la* Persona."

hs9ogc,an idea,"a post apocalyptic survival game where in the beginning it shows you surviving how you would, but then you find a baby, stuck in the rubble. you pick it up and find out that it is still alive. you feel bad so you decide to take care of it. and that is what the game revolves around. you have to make sure it's health, thirst and hunger are up, and to do any type of action, you have to set the child down, potentially risking it's life. yes, you actually have to pick up, carry, and set it down like it is an item."
hs87d1,City building games with moving cities,"I like city building games but I often get disappointed by the lack of danger, the lack of frustrating events happening. \n\nIn games that actually throw bad stuff at you, it's usually natural disasters, random bad things (power surge, meteorite, stuff like that) or people attacking your settlement.\n\nWhat if it was more than that, what if entire cities were attacking you ?\n\nIt would be a mix between mortal engines and the myth of baba yaga. Basically, a big magical cataclysm wiped out the world and the survivors managed to learn and use magic. With that, they created cities with legs and other contraptions, merging industrial devices and magical functionalities.\n\nYou then have a basic building game but your city can move and you have to go where resources are to survive and expend your city.\n\nIn addition to natural disasters, random bad things and the occasional big magical monster (dragons ?) attacking you, there would be cities that fancy the same resources as you, which would lead your city into technological and magical wars with other cities.\n\nYou would be able to develop both your magical abilities and technological skills to increase the movement speed of your city's legs, your spells' strength for combat, or instead increase your production and the efficiency or your weapons.\n\nAs for in-city events, there would be the usual things like people having a bad mood, but some things like discrimination against magic users could happen if your city is not balanced between magic users/magical beings and classic humans.\n\nI think the hardest part would probably be the dev as city building games probably require a lot of stuff to code in general. Graphics could be simply low poly 3D stuff with a minimum of animations or big AAA stuff ofc."
hs4e48,A 2-d game known as copier where the player creates his certain amount of copies at strategic locations.,"Copier creates his copy on different strategic locations of the map. All his location where he has created his copies are displayed on an alternate window. As a result, he sees what his copies see and gain LIVE information from the surroundings of his copies. Villains are defeated using a number of copies. When a player dies his most recent copy gains control of the game."
hs27v0,Punch Out Titans,"Y'know that Little Mac/Big Mac gimmick for Punch Out on the wii for multiplayer? Give that to Little mac for the champaign, and a similar version for each of the boss fights.... They'd turn into big monsters. The two opponents can't be monsters at the same time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSoda Popinski would get a Soda Volcano head, for example."
hs1o45,A zombie game and mmorpg but not what you think.,"What I think would be extremely fun and has never been done is a game similar to Tarkov, Dibalo,  Skyrim. Like they all have a baby but it's a zombie game. Like an mmorpg but not what you'd typically think of. Here's vague elements of game play examples but not clear of what I have in mind. You can loot, shoot, level up and a play a human character. But there should be an option to play as a zombie, or different types of zombies, or a monster rather. Earning powers and stats. For example at the lower end you are a basic zombie or monster. Working up to stronger monsters including a Brawler from Prototype, then maybe a Juggernaut from zombie games, then a Goliath from Prototype, then something like the protagonist from Prototype. Who can do everything human character can do but has powers like monsters. Stronger than both but insanely hard to earn. Humans have different classes. Maybe powers and skills too."
hs1ipy,Would this work as a game? Has it already been done?,What if someone made a dragon ball or monster fighting game or something and it used NBA 2k’s character creation system like using pie charts and setting potential and things like that so you have more choice over how you want to play the game. I would personally love a game like that because I love having that freedom in games. If there are any games like this already please tell me. But I don’t just mean class select or something I mean how in 2k you can change wingspan  or a small specific and get an entirely new build. I think this adds a really cool aspect to the game where most players use different builds catered to their personal preference.

Go to your kitchen to make food by standing near it for a bit then go to battle\n\nTwo game modes: Judge and War\n\nJudge: there are judges in the battlefield and you throw as much food as you can at the judges, whoever gets the most damage on the judges wins. Hit other players to slow them down or kill them.\n\nWar: teams gave X amount of lives for each chef first one to destroy the others kitchen wins."

But on a MASSIVE scale like Planetside."

hrousw,Need help with game ideas &amp; mechanics,"I'm like way too lazy to ask in multiple posts (lol) so here I go\n\n\nDoes anyone have any ideas (story-wise) and new mechanics to implement for these genres\n\n\n-Platformer\n-RPG\n-Match-3 puzzle games \n\n\nI've seen some small games here and there where they either tried to mix weird genres together or used a game mechanic from a different game genre into their game idea and from what I have played and seen so far online, they have been pretty unsuccessful.\n\n\nI was wondering if anyone had any good or creative ideas that don't sound too uncompatible for each other."
hrn5zl,A post-apocalyptic game where all your information is from before the apocalypse,"So for instance your map of a city would be for the city as it was before the apocalypse, meaning you can't rely on it completely while exploring. I just thought this was a cool idea IDK"
hrevua,Game where you become very kill crazy.,"Based on Zero Punctuation's review of (modern) Tomb Raider.\n\nYou are whiny action woman with daddy issues. You must fight Mr. Very Bad Guy^(TM) and his endless supply of dudes.\n\nYou start out whiny, depressed and ""I must fight Mr. Very Bad Guy^(TM) because he was an enemy of my Dad."" in a slightly desaturated forest where only two types of weather exist: Very cloudy or raining. The enemies have little personality, the take downs are rather quick and simple and the game is very stealth focus.\n\nBut as you go through the game killing the enemies. The game starts to change.\n\nAction Lady starts showing less emotion, the screen starts getting a heavy red and black tint, the enemies start getting scared and wary to the point they start running away, the take downs become longer and more violent and the game becomes a rather fast paced hack and slash, almost Hotline Miami style."
hrccqd,MMORPG idea,"I have an idea for an MMORPG that takes place on Earth in a dystopian future. Basically a portal from Hell is opened by a crown prince of Hell and demons flood the Earth and massacre humans and archangels come to Earth to do battle and purge them. You get to customize your character and choose classes. You battle with swords and divine powers. Sorry if this is a lame idea, just a thought."
hrb575,Fruit Ninja but instead of fruits you are separating conjoined twins with surgical tools.,I’m thinking baby to toddler aged conjoined twins are launched at the player who then must slice them apart where they are connected. There would be a greater emphasis on accuracy than there is in FN and possibly a mini game between levels where you sew the wounds closed. \n\nPoints can be spent to upgrade your scalpel and buy tools/a lawyer.

hr4q6i,An FPS/MOBA combination using Metal,"A Doom type game mixed with LoL and Overwatch. Heavily over the top and satirical, also based on the metal genre of music and all it's sub genres (can you tell I listen to metal yet 😂). The classes would be based off of the name and feel of the sub genre itself, so Viking metal would obviously be Vikings, power metal = wizards, heavy metal = bikers, etc... \n\nAround the game you could also find some references to bands. Maps would also include references to bands (i.e., The Kornfields, Linkin State Park, The Whitechapel, etc...)\n\nMatches would be 8v8 and there would be towers on each side like LoL, but since every class has weapons, the towers would have a slight advantage over the players and it would take at least two or three people to take out the field towers, five or six for main towers. I don't know the actual terminology so just roast me 😂"
hr0y5g,HEAVILY dead rising inspired 2d topdown mall multiplayer shooter game,"Here is the idea and primary gameplay; You are in a big mall with every store open and you can pickup and use EVERYTHING just as in Dead Rising, it is a 2d topdown environment but the game is multiplayer and I come from a high rated League of Legends background so the game will be balanced CLOSELY. You queue up and find a good handful of other players to deploy you into a random store in the mall with A LOT of zombies roaming the mall between you and the other players that has deployed, I am not sure on how you'd win the game if it would be a last man standing or a score system, You'd gain score by killing zombies, players, more score with weaker weapons ( chairs, signs, tables etc.. ) I want it to be fast paced with combat rolling ( I like high skill ceiling ) I would also implement systems to combat camping and other exploitative ways to play the game( So you can't just hold up in the store you spawn into with random events maybe like, ""Your store is on fire, Get out!"", ""Zombie horde coming to your location move!"", You get the idea. I want the game to be a beautiful pixel graphic with good soundtracks for various parts of the mall, idle animations for the flowers spread out across the mall ( amongst other things to make the battleground feel more alive ) beautiful blood splatter and satisfying zombie slaying.\n\nThis is just something i've been thinking about a lot lately and I wanted a place to brainstorm it :) Let me know if this sounds fun! Sorry for poor formatting."
hqylma,Any ideas for an objective in a WW2 rts?,
hqy8m2,Control your army of Squirrels as you take over the City.,"The idea came to me when reading another game idea in this Reddit. A humorous approach to the game Overlord, with a combination of the Planet of the Apes movie story. \n\n**Story line**\n\nYou are a squirrel that has been used for animal testing. Human kind is investigating a new anti-potion for illness that is rising. After doing numerous of test cases on you, and some fellow squirrels, you no longer serve use for the Lab. Instead of just killing you and your siblings, they drop you back in nature, where you guys are left to survive for yourself.\n\n You, the more Beefy Squirrel, becomes the mastermind and leader. In order to survive you have to build your home again, gather resources and survive. Enemy's are all around you, from dogs to birds to humans. Survive and build your home again, in the city or in nature. You decide.\n\n**The goal**\n\nSurvive. Build a base for yourself to live in. Gather food to eat. Protect your base from all possible threats.\n\n**Mechanics**\n\nAs the leader of the pack you ave numerous abilities to use for combat or for stealing food:\n\n* Control your followers to take actions for you. For instance, send them out to the grocery story and distract all employees and customers, while you sneak in with your siblings and steal food.\n* Setup your followers to bombard the enemy with nuts.\n* Climb trees, lanterns, buildings, cars etc. Operate your followers from there and plan strategic attacks.\n* Fight bigger enemy's like chihuahua, and turn them in mounts (popped up as I wrote this post)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Notes**\n\nIt is still a rough idea to put on paper, but the mechanics as stated above could be fun when i think of them. Maybe I should make some concept art for it. All feedback is welcome!"
hqxmat,A relaxing game about pollinating/crafting flowers,"Basically you play as a bee (or any creature as it is more fantasy than realistic) flying around in an open field. \n\nYou grab pollen from one plant and put it on another. The idea is that each plant has a ""component"" (the pollen you pick up) when you place it on another plant, they are ""combined"" (or crafted if you will) into a new type of plant. \n\nSo for example you can pick up the pink flower pollen/component and then you fly to the green flower plant. Place the pink on the green and perhaps you get a more purplish plant. \n\nYou try to pollinate the entire field using it to create kind of like a ""painting"" if you will showcasing different plants, colors and what not. \n\nConsidering having each plant form some kind of music note and as you combine different ones, it also affects the music so maybe the green one plays ""dun, dun, dun"" repeatedly and when you plant a blue one it would play ""tik, tik, tik"" and they both combine to make ""dun, tik, dun, tik, dun, tik"" for example. Though this might complicate the idea and kill the relaxing mood if the music turns out to be off due to the different combinations."
hqxi5u,A section of a game where your high leveled character needs to fear beginning enemies again,"This isn't really a specific idea but I think it would be a good way to humble a player that's lost perspective. You know how in games everyone is a scared villager that's afraid of a monster that you take out easily? You know how near endgame, many enemies become trivial and you wade through them? I think it would be neat to create an endgame section where the player gets their tools stripped from them sombra emp style or something and they become genuinely afraid/ challenged by beginning enemies they previously didn't care about. A good example of this is the anime Goblin Slayer. The average adventurer thinks of goblins as this trivial low level enemy but they're actually horrific from a villager point of view. \n\nI'm not sure how you'd implement this but I think it'd be a nice change of pace, maybe it's a trap from a nemesis meant to humiliate you or something."

hqofts,"Idea for a Game that is like the organ trail, Xcom, fallout, and Pokémon.","The game I have the idea for is a game set in a post apocalyptic world, where you control a group a people that have just inmirged from a bunker. Your mission is to travel to place called the ork city that is 51,000 miles away. The game play is where you move along and sometimes you’ll stop to set camp. When you set camp, you can 1) heal up your teammates in your group2) switch weapons and equipment with other team mates 3) search for supplies 4) boost morale so your teammates will act better together when fighting, and 5) sleep which will end the camp event. There are times when you’ll come to a building and you can search it for supplies. Then there are fights, the fights are just Xcom. During the game you can find more people to add to your group. I hope someone finds this interesting"
hqj847,a game about unsubscribing,"you have gathered all your papers that contain all the info you need, and you are confident as you can be.\n\nthis game is a dialogue tree mixed with elements of papers please, as you go through all the arbitrary requirements to unsubscribe from the automatic paid subscription to the merged buzzfeed and facebook lovechild.\n\ncharge up your no meter to sound confident but not too rude the customer service person goes rambling on about you being unco-operative.\n\nsort through papers to tell the many obscure identifications you need to the person you're calling.\n\nsay no to every offer he gives you.\n\ni think how the game would end with you victorious is by fully charging your no meter at his final plea to keep you subscribed, reaching through the dialogue boxes to grab him by the neck, and yelling in your most angry voice, **""NO F@%#ING THANKS!""** and him meekly saying. ^(""alright, i'll unsubscribe you right now"")\n\nso thats my idea, what do you think?"

hq7ef3,RTGame mentioned that a minions battle royale game would be cool to see in a stream a while back... sooo...,"How about a Minions themed BR game. Yellow sausages with goggles dubbed with a name fight to the death on a deserted island with weapons stored on it for sport. Weapons will be difficult to handle as minions are only like 3 feet tall, they can slo range in size/strength/speed according to how they are according to the player. Guns would have lots of recoil, heavy weapons would be harder to handle, melee weapons may be prefered, vehicles would be tougher to drive and will require teamwork to drive. RT also mentioned he would want it to be gory for more enjoyment from seeing annoying tic tacs being blown to pieces. Maybe your goggles will crack when damaged, and will blur your vision. Meaning you need to patch it with whatever you can find, or get new ones. Front pocket on clothing will be used as a small storage until you can find a backpack. So how would you feel with this as some parody game?"
hq2o6q,A skateboarding Metroidvania,"This is an idea I've been kicking around for a while now, kind of as a ""what if"" thing. Metroidvanias are all about using skills to open areas in an interconnected map. I remember that the later Tony Hawk games had an interconnected map (American Wasteland comes to mind), but what if these were locked behind skills? In a skateboarding context, I'm not totally sure what these could be. Maybe you can't progress unless you learn certain moves or get better equipment. Like, maybe you have to impress certain groups before they let you pass? Or maybe you can't enter certain competitions until you have certain gear later on. And as you get better, the more opportunities you have available to you as a skater."

hprt63,A bank robber/mafia game set in the 70s,"The game is set in 1976 and the protagonist is named franklin pierce. He is a father of 3, he is in his late 30s. Him and his friend Rick get layed off one day. Rick has a contact by the name of Micheal katowski, he’s a bank robber/mafia member, Micheal is the right hand man of the infamous drug dealer Jim gage, he’s Canadian and has been smuggling things across the borders of Mexico, Canada, America, and Brazil for about 16 years for Brazilian mafia boss Juan Francisco. Anyway, Micheal says that he can give rick and Franklin some paychecks if they do a couple of jobs for him. Over the course of 4 years, Jim, Micheal, Franklin, and Rick, along with a couple of other people commit multiple crimes across the us and Mexico. Anyway, that’s just an idea that popped into my head a couple of weeks ago, I still need to put some work into it but that’s just a summary."
hpr0xe,Home invasion based game,I had an idea idk if it has been made before or not. So basically the game is home invasion based but with two players. One player is the owner of the house and the other one is the thief obviously. So both can hear footsteps of one another. the owner needs to escape the house or beat the thief by trapping him.The lights should be on or off but giving the players the option to either have them on or off. if they are off the owner can either turn on his flash light or walk in the dark trying to escape or trap the thief or call the cops and wait. it should be randomly generated too.thanks for hearing me.
hpnjd2,Arcane Descent (pure magic dungeon crawler),"The Magi were a cult obsessed with the art of magic. They were so obsessed that they became a danger to society, and the order was outlawed. To keep their order alive, they built a stronghold underground, reaching deeper and deeper as time went on. A failed (we believe) spell opened a rift in the furthest reaches of their stronghold, sending thousands of crazed, violent creatures of unknown origins up through the stronghold, and onto the surface. The local government sought an end to this havoc, found the stronghold, and bombed the entrance.\n\nFive thousand years later the myth of the Cult of the Magi is nearly forgotten. Nothing remains on the surface of their stronghold. You are not a Magi. What you are is slightly brilliant, and quite careless. Not paying attention to the path ahead of you, a dirt-covered skylight shatters, taking you with it. You are now stuck on the top level of the stronghold without a weapon. May the gods be merciful.\n\n* The basic idea of the game is you don't get a weapon. All you get is an amulet, found on the first level of the dungeon, which gives you ""armor"", and an old spellbook, also found there, with a single spell word; Bolt. It does some damage to one creature at a time. \n* The amulet feeds off of the magic you cast, and levels with enough experience, slightly boosting your armor.\n* As you progress through the dungeon, you can find pieces of paper, torn from old magic books. These have spells you don't understand, but you write down a word from each. If you find another spell with the same word, that word becomes slightly more familiar, and becomes ""stronger"". A single spell word might do something, and it might not. \n* Combining words creates actual spells. The right combination can be incredibly powerful, and the wrong one can be absolutely devastating. The more complicated the spell (more words), the stronger the spell might be. You can keybind up to five of them at a time."
hpn7r0,"Fight, Survive, RISE - Reverse Battle Royale","One hundred souls. Crawling from a rolling and shuddering dark mass onto a large round arena. Each soul a mass of ichor slowly given form and color. Becoming bone encased in flesh, fury and hope made manifest. Each soul looks upon themselves, each other, and the never-ending mass from whence they slithered. \n\nA sharp crack and flash draws their eyes center of the arena then above. A crimson sky that gradients black above their ring. At the heart of the shadows above lies but a single white light. \n\nJust the sight alone fills the core of the hundred with burning determination.\n\nSuddenly bile sludge drops from the inky black of the sky, splattering at the center of the arena. From the sinewy mire rose bipedal silhouettes, each bearing all matter of wood, iron, and steel in their pulsating hands.\n\nThey will kill you.\n\nNaked and unarmed, you stand with 99 others.\n\nOff the arena, among the gestating monstrous mass, you hear.  \n\n\nFIGHT...SURVIVE...RISE\n\n\-\n\nYou and 99 other players come from a fleshy eldritch mass and must fight upon an arena and ascend levels until you fall or reach the light. You start off with nothing but strips fleshy ichor as clothes and can collect all matter of weapons from the enemy A.I. that would keep you down or from fallen players with you at each level.\n\nIt is straight up cooperative as you must work with your fellow challengers to beat the level and ascend higher into the sky. Your pick ups can determine how you will play and in between levels there will be traders, shrines, and perhaps other secrets. Challengers can drop items and gear for their fellow. It is encouraged to share for higher levels may be geared towards a hundred challengers, even if you have lost brethren along your ascension.\n\nTypes of equipment:\n\n* Weapons: Be it dagger, cestus, hammer, or perhaps katana and scimitar. Even a magic staff is an option. A variety of weapons that will be thrown at you. Kill them first to wield it yourself. Some may even be blessed. Or cursed. Flip that coin. Range is on the fence....\n*  Armor: There would be plenty of bragging rights to ascend fully without cloth, but it would be a difficult and perhaps painful endeavor. Cover yourself with whatever you find to shield your form for more time on the clock. Maybe it will have additional bonuses.\n* Talismans and Artifacts: Accessories make the hero. Each come with a boon or a weight. Some may even carry additional abilities.\n* Blessings and Curses: Shrines can grant favors from entities that wish to see how high your somewhat feeble attempts get you. They may also stack curses that weight you down to see your spirit embolden. Certain enemies may grant either application.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAn idea that has been nagging at the back of my mind since the whole battle royal phase has been sweeping the world. While I like the whole rising above other players, I've always been more of a PvE kind of guy and just surprised there hasn't been something along the lines of 100 players vs the world. MMOs kind of do it, but its limited to events and nowhere close to 100 in raids or dungeons.\n\nBesides, it would be interesting to see a hundred players fighting together against mobs and bosses while hearing that scene from Dark Knight Rises as the amorphous mass cheers you on higher."
hpkx18,Borderlands + Fallout yet it comes out less insane.,"Gearbox throws alot of guns at players. A bazillion of guns apparently. Many would say about 80 to 90% useless. The worst feeling is getting a weapon that feels right, sounds right, hits right, and just all round triggers that nice fuzzy feeling whenever you squeeze the trigger\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nand then you pop one guy and he drops a gun with stats just a tad better. Whelp, good bye partner. Gotta make that number go up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBefore the first Borderlands came out, it originally had a more serious theme and setting. This version had a gun part loot system that allowed players to swap parts from different brands to make that sweet sweet big iron you would have as a companion. Then it had the radical redesign that made it to the Borderlands we know and love today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI realize I'm probably gonna get too wordy for this so just gonna lay it out.\n\n1. Main theme is definitely gonna be super corporate space western or cyber dystopia. Lots of brands brings variety of parts i.e. Tediore = cheap and fast but low quality/disposable - Hyperion = High Tech and Accurate but slow and low power.\n2. Every time a story comes to mind, it ends up meeting the same beats of Fallout New Vegas or just westerns in general. A mysterious stranger packing a hell of a strap. \n3. Open world is nice, but being first person hub-based dungeon-crawler like Phantasy Star would make gunplay intimate. Definitely some story-based missions, after all its about the player and their gun. When the player makes the gun they always dreamed about, the game shouldn't just end there. Probably have to encourage experimentation.\n4. Thoughts on the possibility of multiplayer would definitely be more on co-op/pve. Imagine trying to balance every possible combination of parts on players super gun. Thats nightmarish.\n5. Should the gun be the only thing the player messes around with? On one hand, its the system that should truly stand out. The other hand though, more options is always a plus.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThats my case. I really do love weapon customization. It allows one to have something they can call their signature.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is the part where I wanna get wordy. GUN CUSTOMIZATION\n\n* Fallout 4 has great gun crafting system that has extensive levels of options. Most weapons allow for a good amount of personalizing. Pipe weapons can be bolt-action, revolver, semi, and auto. You can go pistol to rifle with a variety of attachments.\n* Most Call of Duty games allow for weapon personalizing. Not in attachments but in paint and design tho.\n* A team shooter called Loadout had an interesting weapon system where you could make a regular assault rifle, but change a few parts and you get auto rocket thrower or a tesla gun that chains. Very violent and cartoony.\n* Mothergunship has an extreme gun crafting system that also involves struts and wedges so you can make a spear with a minigun and flamethrower tip or completely block out your screen with big barrel cannons. It gets quite insane.\n\nI like borderlands. I just really really REALLY liked that original idea of a shlooter (Shoot looter) that focused on building that ideal gun. The variety of guns in BL3 is fantastic, but there are some things you just want more of. My personal favorite company in Borderlands is Tediore that specializes in disposable guns, I love them in BL2 because they gave my favorite weapon, called Deliverance which was a shotgun that when reloaded was thrown and became an enemy seeking drone that fired as it chased down hostiles."

hwn786,A horror game where you play as Jean Grey in her teens.,"Here’s the pitch. Jean Grey runs away from home as a teenager. She can’t get a handle on her powers. She steals a tent and some supplies from her parents and escapes into the woods. During the day she explores and survives as much as she can. When she sleeps, her nightmares get super trippy and terrifying. At night she has to avoid wolves and other predators. She doesn’t have a handle on her powers so other than moving small objects she is relatively powerless and has to use things like bows and arrows she makes herself.\n\nThe game ends with her getting out of the woods and stumbling on the grounds of Charles Xaviers school. Having clearly been through a lot, Charles takes her in."
hwf5hg,Megaman battle network type mobile game. level up one character,"Im a huge fan of having one character that you level up! I actually dislike when you have loads of characters or tons with different skills etc. Everyone starts off with one character and then battles others the same way that you do in the megaman battle network game which is by collecting cards and then using them on a board in real time. these cards will have moves such as shoot 3 bullets in a straight line or create shield in front of you for 2 seconds etc. You can then level up these cards and gain new ones and then level up your one character as well after winning battles. With a new skill, attributes and armour/equips etc so every character will be and look unique. imagine a maple story or ragnarok type character and you can change colours of equips and equips change your look too"
hwf1ll,Alternate DC Universe type game,"Just thought of this like 2 minutes ago but I wouldn’t mind to see a DC game but altered, you know how superheroing doesn’t make you money, A world full of super humans going through somewhat poverty, on one side superhero’s are working a job say a 9 to 5 job so they don’t have time to save people and fight crime and stuff, and when they get home they’re to tired to do anything, they might even resort to prostitution and even turn evil and start robbing stores and banks, on another side supervillains are pillaging banks and petty criminals are robbing or even looting people’s business which is making the world go into a international poverty and on the other corner are superhero millionaires like Batman and superman are the only few who can fight crime or you can be a citizen/vigilante who tries to stop the robberies of stores and maybe even banks, you can learn all types of martial arts such as well MMA, Karate, Muay Thai, Kick boxing or you can resort to more lethal measures and use blades such as knives, daggers, katanas or any other weapon you can think of, get a gun license and put away the filth of the world permanently \n\nYou can choose your own path become a superhero - Supervillain - Millionaire - Citizen/Vigilante, and your decision changes the world, Will you save the world from collapsing under poverty and crime or will you be the one to destroy its supports?"
hwdvnp,"""Ghost Brigade"" - A 4D RTS","Core Concept:\n\nA Real Time Strategy Game which incorporates multiple parallel battlefields as ""extra dimensional spaces"". This allows for additional tactics in outflanking, scouting and fighting by literally providing a different direction to attack and be attacked from.\n\nRather than merely having a single ""Shadow World"" which some units can interact with, this game features a ""Depth"" mechanic of sorts where you can visit progressively deeper dimensions which have a 1:1 correspondence with your home dimension. eg: if you move from one to another, you occupy the same equivalent location. allowing you to bypass obstacles by going ""around"" them through another dimension.\n\nOther dimensions are shadow-worlds, light from the sun filters through, but the deeper in the dimensions you go, the less light and warmth there is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAccess to deeper dimensions is improved by tech-tree upgrades.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first few dimensions include plants and animals, in decreasing frequency as you get further in.\n\nThese plants and animals are markedly alien, some of them hostile.\n\nDeeper dimensions harbor few if any forms of life, being starved of light and warmth.\n\nThe deeper dimensions are uninhabitable super-cooled pitch black wastelands, traversable only by certain types of units which are equipped to handle them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTerrain is significantly different. Deeper dimensions have progressively less water and/or erosion, so the terrain is rougher, but largely more traversable the deeper you go.\n\nTerrain features like rivers, lakes and cliffs that would present a physical obstacle can be circumvented by shifting to another dimension where they're not a problem.\n\nOn the other hand, some terrain is unique to deeper dimensions, such as rivers and pools of super-cooled gases which can be exploited as resources.\n\nUnits in adjacent dimensions are visible as ""ghosts"", becoming fainter the greater the difference.Hence the game's name ""Ghost Brigade"".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTravelling between dimensions is typically done using specialised Portal buildings, but some specific units are capable of ""diving"" unsupported.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBuildings and units can be constructed in other dimensions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTravelling between dimensions takes significant energy/resource, so it's not a casual thing early on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDimensional Displacement generators can be constructed to force enemy units into their dimension. This is a great way to defend a base, simply place a generator in a nearby dimension and surround it with defences so that units are forced away from their intended targets and subject to massive amounts of turrets.\n\nDownsides: the generator needs to be powered constantly for the strategy to work and only affects a few layers of dimensions away. (upgradeable?)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOther dimensions have only small amounts of most resources. The 0th(primary) Layer is therefore always necessary. At least until you gain resource-converters which can trade basic resources for more advanced ones.\n\nConstructing a deep-dimension base directly on top of an enemy base so you can drop an army on them via portals is a Difficult But Awesome tactic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLocating extradimensional bases is generally a challenge.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBase Power does not propagate between dimensions, requiring any bases to be able to support themselves.\n\nDeeper in the dimensions, sources of power are weaker and rarer, eg: the sun is dimmer, the atmosphere thinner, geothermal activity is lower to non-existent.\n\nSo power buildings are less efficient.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDefending your own base should be done across multiple dimensions for a more literal version of the phrase ""Defence in depth""\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNarrative suggestions:\n\nRuins of precursor races which used the extradimensional spaces. (think lovecraftian cyclopean architecture)\n\nInvasion by a race that lives on one of the other dimensions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nResources:\n\nMetal - Mined by Ore-miners (either as buildings or units)\n\nPower - Generated by specialised buildings. Power transfers from building to building, so two independent bases require independent power supplies.\n\nHydrogen Gas (?) - A Gas which can be found in most dimensions. In the 0th layer and most others, it can be extracted from water.\n\nIn the deepest dimensions, it can be found in liquid supercooled form on the surface and is significantly easier to extract. (offsetting the relative rarity of the other resources)\n\nThe Gas is used in unit-manufacture alongside Metal, where Metal is the primary resource for manufacturing buildings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUnit And Building Types that specifically make use of the non-traditional game mechanics:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBuildings:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDimensional Gateway - can be targeted to a particular dimensional level, vehicles and infantry move into it and emerge in a different dimension.\n\nThe portal is two-way and can be used by friendly or enemy units.\n\nUnits can return via the gate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDimensional Displacement Generator - Pulls units into its dimension from nearby layers. Can be used as a defensive measure to prevent enemies from scouting using extradimensional units, or to force units into a nearby dimension full of turrets and walls...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPower Transfer Unit. - sends energy across dimensions if you construct an identical building on the same spot in the target dimension.\n\nThis negates the problems of powering an outpost in the sunless realms...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nVorpal Scanner - Allows detection of units in other dimensions, mostly by showing markers where units are, but also reveals them if you set your view to show a different dimension.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUnits:\n\nThe Houdini - A fast scout unit capable of shifting dimensions on a cooldown.\n\nThe Phantom - A specialised tank capable of the same dimension-shifting as the Houdini. Fragile but well armed, suitable for ambushes\n\nMobile Gateway - Essentially a smaller, slow moving portable Dimensional Gateway building, must deploy to be used. But allows units to traverse to other dimensions.  \nCannot transport itself, but a pair of them could ""leapfrog"" if necessary.\n\nTime-cooldown Powers:\n\nDisplacement - shunt units in one dimension one layer down. Does not work on buildings. Provided by the Dimensional Displacement Generator structure. (alternate variation might allow directing units to a specific layer, eg: punting unprotected infantry into a deep dimension where they instantly freeze to death)\n\nDeep-Scan - Reveal units at a targeted location in all dimensions. Provided by the Vorpal Scanner building."
hwccle,Hot potato but extreme,a small idea and maybe already taken(?) but I had an idea of a multiplayer hot potato game where you try to give the ticking bomb to the other person but the twist is that its also a platformer game.

hwb76c,2D single player support game with a twist,"This game is a bit unique but basically, the idea is that you play support in AI raids except all you can do is redirect enemy damage and traps in order to help your team. This turns into a bit of a puzzle game and is just a creative way of making a support character. \n\nFor example, maybe you create deflector barriors that redirect enemy fire towards themselves, or hack enemy supports to heal your team, or create a wall that turns incoming fire into healing/ buffs. Let's say you only get a certain amount of these tools and you have to constantly recall and replace them around your team as they fight through different areas."
hw97qq,MMORPG: GTA vs The Sims vs Second Life,"Like SL, you can be anyone you want to be. Like The Sims, you start as practically nobody (literally all you own at first is your underwear and a blanket), and have to skill up, make connections, branch out (don't worry, even though you still *have* needs, you don't spend the entire game juggling tasks to keep bars full), and like GTA, the place is a bit ripe for crime.\n\nYou get a pre-built city (effectively indestructible. You can watch it burn, but it'll be right back. The owner will just lose a lot of money, unless they have insurance), where you can own all of it, work anywhere you want, live anywhere you want etc. There are mansions, houses, apartments, nightclubs, brothels.... Basically everything you find in a city... There's also an economy, and lots of other players all trying to get by/get rich/become famous/whatever.\n\nMeanwhile you just wandered up in your underwear, clutching a dirty flea-ridden blanket. Then again, so did everyone else.\n\nOh, and yes, there's even politics. You can potentially replace the asshole NPC mayor if other players vote for you. Actually the vast majority of NPCs can be replaced by human players. The only thing that's untouchable is the bank... Well.. Apart from robberies of course. You just can't operate it. You can own it, but yeah.\n\nDue to skill trees and professions, most things will be out of reach at first. Can't rob a bank, because you'll get caught and arrested. Maybe you at least want a gun. Gun shop owner will certainly put you down though. Etc. Until you've got the skillset and the right equipment, you're going nowhere fast. Breaking into a house can be done, but unless you've bought it, you're getting heat for that.\n\nOh, and there aren't enough homes for the maximum amount of players on a server. Someone needs to build more or you'll have a homelessness problem. Good thing that's a profession. Much like prostitution is"

The more dangerous situations you put yourself in, the quicker it will be revealed to you, and the more it will grow and ""level up"", kind of like Bleach's Bangkai and Demon Slayer's new breath forms.

hvzjr5,Gauntlet: Dark Legacy inspired game with characters and settings of various time periods clashing together,"I imagine this game being very similar to Gauntlet: Dark Legacy in terms of isometric perspective, catchy soundtrack, and some of the visual aesthetics. Very vibrant and colorful and possibly with a blocky late 90s-early 2000s graphical style much like GDL as a throwback. Instead of only being medieval fantasy-based, this would combine various types of sci-fi and fantasy and span many time periods and locales.  Anything from the prehistoric age to the past couple of decades. One level you could be in a gothic castle, while in the next you’re in 1980s Miami, ancient Egyptian pyramids, an extreme sports event in the early 2000s, a Final Fantasy XI-esque airship city, or a Wild West saloon. \nThe roster of characters would be large, with minimal movesets consisting of a regular attack, strong attack, close range attacks, and a few super moves based on a gauge that gets refilled by attacking enemies. The game would be up to 4 players and each character would have 8 alternate colors. Much like Gauntlet Dark Legacy, each character’s color would heavily change their appearance. For example, say you choose a warrior class, right? The red warrior has a typical “Conan the Barbarian” type look with a large broadsword. However, the green warrior is an Aztec fighter wielding a Macahuitl, and the orange warrior is an Arabian swordsman with a huge scimitar. \nWhile most heroes would be larger than life fighters of fantasy, warfare, and science fiction, a few would be criminals, creatures, and just everyday average dudes. \n\nHere’s my list of classes:\n\n- Knight (flail mace and shield)\n- Cowboy (dual revolvers)\n- Space Marine (laser rifle\n- Wizard (scepter)\n- Pirate (cutlass and blunderbuss)\n- Soldier (Vietnam era, m60 and M79 grenade launcher)\n- Samurai (katana)\n- Jester (bombs)\n- Ninja (kusarigama)\n- Ruffian (Victorian era shotgun) \n- Rockstar (80s guitar)\n- Gangster (tommy gun)\n- Viking (battle-axe)\n- Cavalier (riding on horseback, broadsword)\n- Vampire (rapier sword, bats)\n- Dragon (claws, flames)\n- Witch (magical orb)\n- Musketeer (musket)\n- Dwarf (warhammer)\n- Assassin (throwing knives, daggers)\n- Thief (dagger and flintlock pistol)\n- Warrior (two-handed sword)\n- Banger (submachine gun)\n- Valkyrie (sword and shield)\n- Witch Doctor (magical skull)\n- Spec-Ops (assault rifle and MGL grenade launcher)\n- Berserker (spiked club)\n- Monk (deer horn blades)\n- Necromancer (scythe)\n- Paladin (morningstar)\n- Alchemist (acidic chemicals and potions)\n- Gladiator (trident)\n- Brave (tomahawk)\n- Hunter (bow &amp; arrow)\n- Warlock (basilisk summon)\n- Werewolf (claws)\n- Alien Warrior (lightsaber)\n- Mech-soldier (General Grievous-type multi lightsaber)\n- Ranger (repeater rifle)\n- Bard (crossbow)\n- Sorceress (whipsword)\n- Commando (Gatling gun) \n- Athlete (baseball bat/hockey stick/etc.)\n- Punk (dual switchblades)\n- Slasher (chainsaw)\n- Phantom (spirit energy blades)"
hvyjg2,Fighting/Action Game with focus on character customization,"It has to have a main story with original characters, ok, but the focus should be the **creation center**, where you can customize clothes, body, armor, stats, and weapons/items, but also choose and create your own **moves**, throws and kicks. You can use a martial art package (which contains only taekwondo moves, for example) or mix it all up, assigning different buttons and combos for your moves. Your custom fighter will then try to rise among the **online multiplayer** ranks, in different categories. You can fight a sword-only **tournament**, for example. Some move combinations should not be allowed for the sake of balance in online matches, of course. The game should also allow you to choose between a lot of different rules, arenas and tournament types.  \n\n\nI remember Soulcalibur have good customization, but it does not let you choose your own moves, your style is always exactly like one of the original characters.  \n\n\nWhat do you think?

I was thinking that maybe a compelling and deep story along with solid gameplay would be enough, but I'm not sure, I'm not an expert. Any advice about that would be helpful.

But as you go back time more, the NPCs will also start to realize something is off and react differently (for example if you shot someone and repeated that multiple times because you went back time, they might take cover before you get a chance to take a shot). I still don't really know what this can fit well with but thought it would be a cool game mechanic that is not too overpowered"

hvg1xn,Help!!,Hello. I’m new to this and I have no idea if this is even allowed to be posted but I’ve been playing for roblox for about a year maybe and I have a crappy computer and my phone only. I don’t know how to create a game but I’ve had many ideas and I’ve asked around but most people need to be paid to create a game and develop and stuff like that. If that isn’t true I would love some help if possible or even someone showing me how to create me own game. I hope this post makes sense. I don’t know how reddit works so comment and if you need my other social media I’ll be happy to give it to you or message me here. Thank you.
hvecy6,Hyborian Style CRPG,"As the title states my idea is for a CRPG set in a world similar to that of Conan the Barbarian. The lack of more advanced civilization would make random encounters with monster more believable and there's a lot more space for mystique and wonder, but also brutality."
hvdml3,Arthur Knight’s Quest to Rock On!,"This is a game me and a small group of people are working on during this time, and even will be continuing afterwards! This game is called Arthur Knight’s Quest to Rock On! Here’s the parts of the game we have figured out.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlot:\n\nIn a distant land, full of mythical magic and mortifying monsters, there was an evil Wizard named Sax Tempest. Sax was a rather reasonable man, and yet was always calm, unless provoked. The Wizard did have one weakness, however. He had extremely sensitive ears. And while he may have trained his ears against day to day sounds, there was one thing he could never resist.... music. Unfortunately for him, he happened to enter the land of music, Note-opia. Everywhere he turned, music was playing! Music here, music there, it was too much for the Wizard! So, he decided enough was enough. He had to destroy music forever! So, he cast a spell, which silenced all instruments in the land. He then created fowl beasts, which would attack anything that sung/made a note.\n\nThere was one thing Sax didn’t account for, however.... Enchanted Instruments.... Instruments such as guitars and flutes that were imbued with magical properties, and thusly were made immune to Sax’s powerful curse. They were rather rare artifacts of great power, that only a true musician of the required musical craft could wield. As the world began to realize what was happening, many people tried to stand against Sax Tempest, but none would succeed...\n\nThat is, until Arthur Knight stood up.\n\nArthur Knight was one of the wielders of these magical music makers. Axe-caliber, which looked like an electric guitar, but could actually change form to other types of guitars if it made contact with one. However, since Arthur’s main choice of guitar was the electric guitar, he chose not to bother with other types.\n\nArthur saw the miserable state Note-opia was in, and decided he needed to stand up and fight for his home! But he knew he wasn’t strong enough on his own. So he decided he needed to seek out fellow wielders of these artifacts, and perhaps gain their power to add to his own arsenal! That way, he would have way more methods of taking down such a sinister psycho.\n\nBut he didn’t know how hard it would really be, because none of the wielders of these artifacts will give them up so willingly.\n\nAnd so, guitar on his back, Magic in his blood, and music in his soul, Arthur Knight set out on an epic quest to bring back music to his homeland. A Quest.... to Rock On!\n\n\nMechanics: The game would play out as an Open World Platformer RPG. The way you would fight would be similar to that of Megaman, Mario, or Cuphead, but would have stats you could increase as you leveled up. (I don’t have a set level cap yet).\n\nYou could take on the final boss any time you want, but of course it will be much more difficult the lower level you are! So you might be better off training first...\n\nEach mini boss beaten will give you a new Musical Artifact to wield in your moveset, and combine pieces of equipment, upgrades, and spells to further your near unlimited arsenal.\n\n\n\nPlease, give me any criticism you can, or maybe point out any plot holes, or even give me ideas for music-themed characters it would all be greatly appreciated! We have a few characters already made for the Rap Genre, Metal Genre, and Disco Genre. Arthur Knight is also fit into the Rock n Roll Genre."

hvazs4,Death by Awkward,"**Awkward**\n\nWhat makes any situation awkward? Bad timing. \nHolding the door open for someone but they continue talking to someone else.\nWalking outside, bound to cross paths but both of you are in a rush to reach your destination.\nTwo or more people arrive at a stop sign at the same time.\n\nCan we make this a multiplayer game? Yes.\n\n**Mechanics**\n\nA countdown begins and then both players begin to slowly move at the same speed. It’s a race - the objective is to reach the destination first. You must follow the drawn path as accurately as possible or your awkward meter increases.\nThe challenge: the other player is bound to cross your path, or is merging onto the same path. You must avoid them. Either player can speed up a bit, but every time you’re near the opponent, your nervous/awkward meter goes up. Once the meter completely fills (or you touch the other opponent) you die, by exploding. From maximum awkwardness.\n\n**Sound Design**\n\nI imagine no actual music or sounds other than the echoes of the player’s footsteps and actions. Perhaps a heartbeat or even thoughts to represent nervousness. \n\n**Communication**\n\nThe only form of communication are hand gestures and grunts (ugh, umm, uhhh). The more nervous you are, the higher the chance of messing up your hand gestures.\n\nIf things get too awkward, you’ll die. From spontaneous combustion.\n\nThat is all."
hvaxq6,"Lone operator, run&amp;gun and sabotage","After I wrote a post in the Assassin's Creed subreddit(and yes, the game is based somewhat off of that post) the idea that I wrote there stayed in my mind. Based on a few games just jumbled together(particularly Red Orchestra 2, The Saboteur, MGS5 and AC:Unity) the idea began bubbling and developing, and slowly it became clearer- How fun would it be if there was a game where you play something similar to a 'Partizan'?\n\nNow, I am well aware that this game will probably never be made because of how complex my idea is, but I am planning to study game development after I finish army and Uni, so who knows.\n\nSo, I will break my game idea down into several sections, each one containing info on that part of the game. Some of the sections will be more detailed than others, but that's because those aspects are the most developed in my mind. If somebody has any criticism of them or even suggestions to add onto them I highly welcome them.\n\n1. **World/Story:** The world would be the most interesting part. Set in an alternative universe where the world has been plunged into ceaseless war since the 1800's, you will play one of the last combatants still alive in a northern forest-like area. Even though you were drafted barely a few months ago you have pledged your life to stop the invading forces with any amount of force necessary. After getting injected with an unready and unstable version of a super-soldier serum you were set out into the bombed out sector that you need to defend, with one final command from HQ before communications were cut off: 'Hold. Them. Back!'\n2. **Style:** I am a sucker for the 'dread' element of WW1 and WW2 German uniform designs, and the game owuld be very much so inspired from stuff like the Steel Legion of Armageddon and the Death Korps of Krieg in WH40K. Heavy yet militatristic suits of armour with face masks, wood&amp;iron antique-looking weaponry, ornate heavy armour for the commanders, heavy use of explosives etc'. The city that the map includes would be a combination of 1700's Paris and 19th century Britain, all bombed out and in ruins.\n3. **Map:** The map is made up of 3 open-world, connected sections: The city, the farmland and the forests. I already described the city in the section above, so I won't dwell on it. The forest would be split between a more traversible forest near the main roads and an untamed, wild growth the farther away you get from it, allowing only  horses and foot soldiers to go through them. The farmland would be vast sections of hills, small settlements alongside rivers and fields.\n4. **Movement:** This is where the meat of the gameplay is. The game would be a 3rd person shooter, so the movement would be pretty important, especially in the more cluttered area. And my thought is... If anybody played AC:Unity before, the parkour system from that game should be brought into this, with all of what it brings: Treetop-traversal, stylish building climbing etc' with just two additions: 'proper' Swimming and something similar to the 'jump on the ground' button from MGS5. There would be a big focus on keeping the flow of the movement, with it being the main tool for both avoiding AND fighting enemies.\n5. **Combat:** Now, I mentioned a super-soldier serum in the beginning. THIS is where it comes in. You could play the game like a standard, boring 3rd-person shooter, but... The game would include a mechanic that I have rarely seen implemented in other games: Hit&amp;run! Due to the faulty and unready serum your adrenal gland went completely out of order, and your body became overly-reactive to pressure: The moment shooting begins your body is flush with adrenaline, allowing oyu to ignore a lot of pain and boosts every bit of your body. Due to plentiful cover in the form of trees, street corners and destroyed houses you can easily run around your enemy, gunning them down while avoiding their fire. Stealth is also a very good option, since your reaction time is much faster than your enemy's and your hearing is much better(yes, the game would have a simple noise mechanic, which I find always helpful in other games that implement it.\n6. **Enemies:** This could be the game biggest strength. I already mentioned a few enemies in the 'style' section like armoured soldiers and commanders, but I feel like the roster could be quite expanded. First of all, tanks! Imagine climbing on a tank or on a tree, throwing onto the engine a satchel charge and then shooting it from afar to blow it up. The Saboteur showed how fun it would be, and I can only imagine how fun it would be doing it while under fire, zig-zagging between trees and small hills to avoid explosives and bullets just to get close enough,throw the charge on the tank and shoot at it, or even throwing one with a lit fuse INSIDE the tank. Second, heavy soldiers! Imagine taking on knight-like soldiers in tench-coats, wielding machineguns and flamethrowers. Once again, I'll refer to the 'terror squads' in The Saboteur for inspiration.\n7. **Gear:** Finally, gear and progression. After completing missions and side-missions you get plenty of money, but not enough to buy every upgrade. Even from the beginning of the game you will need to spec into one of three playstyles: Assault/Grenadier, run&amp;gun and sabotage. Each playstyle spec will offer different ways to complete missions, with some missions more suitable to one style than another, allowing multiple replays of the game to feel different.\n\nSo, what did you think? Got any suggestions or criticism? I would love to hear them!"
hv9sod,A friend told me post this here. Would love some feedback,
hv8puz,Google needs to get a Planet Side 3 made for Stadia.,Google Stadia has very few exclusives and I think something like the Planet Side series would flourish with the technical advantages the platform has. \n\nHaving planets to fight over and the ability exit the atmosphere with thousands of others would be amazing. \n\nThe shooting was never really great in those games and the vehicle combat I think would be fine Stadia's lag. There could even be roles crafted for people with bad connections or playing on smaller devices that would allow the to contribute such as drone/artillery operator or command.
hv5zlr,ATLA battle royal,"First of all, I didn't watch the whole avatar the last airbender serie so sorry if I offend any fan.\n\nSo simple game where you chose to be an air, fire, water, earth, lava, sand or gravity bender (and any other that exist in ATLA or the legend of korra) and then you fight other benders.\n\nIt'd be a fast paced battle royal not using guns basically.\n\nYou'd have a mana bar and when it's empty you need to channel a skill to fill it up again. Like reloading your mana.\n\nAs time of a game goes by, you unlock new abilities, like if your character was training through battle and getting better as a game moves on.\n\nEach class could be associated to an archetype like fire would be dps, earth would be tank, water would be healer (if it's played in small teams like in apex) and air would be crowd control."
hv5un1,A RPG like horror game that may or may not be MMO,"So I thought about this game from seeing all these various games (WORLD OF HORROR, Bloodborne, SCP containment breach, and FINAL FANTASY XIV) and yes, I know it sounds so ambitious but it would be my dream to have a game like this\n\nAn open world game about an investigator in the 1970's who's main focus is to uncover the horrors that were unleashed into the world. From Eldritch horror to horror underwater to even culture horror like Japanese myths and legends, it is a game where the investigator seeks to battle/suppress these monsters and learn about them in the process. There will be combat like firearms, rituals, magic, melee weapons, chants, rituals, possibly anything that would be able to stop a certain entity. There will be different types of entities depending on where your at, what you did and so forth, and these enemies would be unique (similar to the quality and quantity of SCP entities) There will be the big, prime safe area and other smaller safe areas in different locations and it will sell you the things that are found in those areas.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMORE ON DETAILS-\n\n**Prologue:**\n\nThe player first off makes his/her character, pick a class and put their name, and depending on what place they pick or what class they pick, they will have a unique cut scene as of how they got into this in the first place. They first pick:\n\nClass: cultist (mainly magic and rituals)\n\nWar veteran (mainly combat and overall weaponry)\n\nInsightful Scholar (mainly chants and melee)\n\nTroubled mafia member (mainly combat and magic)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlaces: \n\na forest \n\ncity\n\nA town by the docks\n\nFor an example: a player picks the cultist class and picks the forest as the start. They will start as the only cultist left alive after a ritual attempt went horribly wrong and unleashed something that shouldn't have been unleashed. Or if the player picks a cultist but picks the city, they will start as a cultist venturing in the city to find and learn more about the unexplained mysteries that still happens to this day. They will make their way out of the tutorial and the safe area in their selected place becomes accessible. \n\n**Enemies:**\n\nThere would be different types of enemies in different types of areas, but there would be 3 main groups of them:\n\nPhysical (weapons do more damage)\n\nSupernatural (magic do more damage)\n\nPsychological (sometimes cant be destroyed depending on the entity, but could be evaded)\n\nthere will be hybrids, but that is a work in progress.\n\nSometimes some enemies will have a specific way of defeating them, like praying, etc.\n\nThere will also be bosses in the game which it could relate to a myth or a legend, or something completely new and sometimes these bosses will have very specific ways of killing them. Maybe the player has to follow a complicated ritual while being pursued, or use an item correctly to stop an attack or buff the enemy has, but its all also a work in progress.\n\n**Leveling:**\n\nThe way to level up however could be a double edged sword- where it could hurt and help you at the same time:\n\nStandard leveling up: which is EXP or knowledge you get from slaying enemies, uncovering mysteries, disappearance, bosses and etc.\n\nadvanced/Phobic leveling: would be buffs where it will cost you something or give a debuff with a buff\n\nFor example, there's a buff where you can see a specific ghost like entity with a naked eye, but in return- you'll get arachnophobia (fear of spiders). Spiders will appear to be even scarier than it was without the arachnophobia debuff and your character can get damaged more by spiders than usual. Basically, the debuffs will sometimes be related to a phobia and can change the world around you. But the way to remove it is not yet determined (although I thought it would be better if they have their own specific way of removing them). These buffs can be stacked, however- the more there is, the harsher the phobias will be.\n\n**Multiplayer:**\n\nIt is not required for it to be multiplayer, and having it as an MMO is still an idea im not too sure about. \n\nOriginally, I thought it should be similar to how final fantasy XIV is like, but more so fits the game idea more than the game itself obviously. Meaning no buying houses and other stuff that isn't necessary. But you can co-op with players, find other players in the area, talk to them and hang out, interact and use emotes, speak to them as well, basically what ffxiv has."
hv4yaf,Two teams of players with secret identities fight while trying to summon the Elder Gods,"This idea came to me after reading ""A night in the lonesome October"" by Roger Zelazny. The premise of the book is that, once a few years on Halloween, the Elder Gods can enter our world if the appropiate ritual is performed. A cast of public domain characters (Count Dracula, Frankenstein, Jack the Ripper, etc) fight one another, trying to hasten or prevent the summoning of the Elder Gods.\n\nAt the start of the game, the players will receive 3 pieces of information: their identity (what character they play as), the location of their home and their affiliation: Opener or Closer. After that, one other location is randomly chosen and set apart: call this the Eldritch Spot.\n\nThe game should take a fixed amount of turns, depending on the number of players. The Openers have the ability to open Gates between our world and that of the Gods in various locations on the map; they win if, at the end of the last turn, there is a Gate opened on the Eldritch Spot. The Closers can close the Gates created by the Openers and win if there is *no* Gate on the Eldritch Spot at end of the last turn.\n\nThe thing is, during the game, the players can take various actions, but they are anonymous. So, instead of the players knowing ""Alice did X this turn"", they'd learn ""The Vampire did X this turn"", where the vampire is Alice's character. The players can trade their info with one another, or force others to reveal it to them by some other mechanic. Anyways, the goal of each player is to figure out where the Eldritch Spot is and take the appropiate actions so their team wins, while trying not to give too much away about themselves. There should also be some elimination mechanic, so players can take out members of the enemy team, while being careful with what they reveal.\n\nI imagined this as a tabletop game, where the players would have a piece of paper to write down what information they gather (sort of like in Cluedo). The fun would arise from the various interactions between players."
hv4hmv,A Slay The Spire-like Dating Sim Deck Builder,"I had a fun idea for a Deck Builder in same vein as Slay the Spire or Monster Train, but it's a dating sim. Instead of each battle being against various enemies with you playing creatures, your opponent would be a romantic interest. She would be playing various personal obstacles and defenses, while you would be playing traits and gifts and actions to get past her guards. For example she may play something like ""Aloof Personality"" which makes her take less affection but also less irritation, while you may play a generic ""Gift"" or a specific gift she may like, or maybe you'd play your own trait like ""Boisterous"" making all your ""Loud"" Actions more effective.\n\nJust like in Spire or Monster Train, you'd have a map of options you could take, but each one, like in any good dating sim, would take time, and some would only be available at certain times.\n\nYou could even have it like Hand of Fate where you choose your date target at the start of the game, and that effects what encounters you have added.\n\nSome additional ideas:\n\n* If i was making this myself, it would definitely be named ""Holding Hands""\n* Each opponent would have multiple stats, all of which have to be managed to not fail an encounter (my thinking would be Irritation/Annoyance, Patience, and Affection, or something along those lines), at minimum one of which being positive and one that goes down with time or failure\n* You would have 4 card types: Gifts, Questions, Actions, and Traits (Gifts and Actions both being used on the turn, but Traits being played down and permanently in play, tho some Actions may have a permanent effect too, and Questions would net you information about your opponent)\n* You could have places like a Gym which, like in Spire or MT, give you choices between cards (my thought for the gym specifically would be each option would give you a straight up good card or two, but also Sweat, a negative Trait card that stays in your hand once you draw it. You could keep working out, spending more time and getting more cards, but you'd also get more Sweat filling up your deck too)\n* You would end every day by going home to bed, where you could then choose a few different way to manage your deck\n* Each opponent would have specific tastes, and gifts that match their taste would give more Affection, while gifts they dislike would lose it. You'd be able to learn these tastes the hard way, or by taking certain event options to learn about them (or by playing Questions)\n* Not every card an opponent plays would be negative, especially if you were in a full on Date (which would either be the final encounter or just boss matches essentially). If you're in a date or you have their Affection past a certain threshold (obviously different per waifu) they'd hit the point of *wanting* to like you, so they'd start playing positive cards that weaken their own existing cards or just straight up buff yours. Or maybe they draw a poor hand (as they'd be drawing from their own deck too), and have nothing *but* positive cards. Because sometimes you just have a good encounter.\n* Every card you play would cost Energy (simple, i know, but fitting), and possibly even Patience from her end.\n* At the start of each game, before even picking your waifu, you'd decide what type of person you want to start as (the starting options probably being Generic Harem Protag, Nerd, and Jock, maybe even with Comedic Relief; general harem/romcom tropes, all of them), which affects what your starting deck is but also adds or removes certain event options (a nerd wouldnt hit the gym, at least not as often)\n* On easier difficulties, you could even retry encounters you failed by simply losing another time slot and having the opponent start with less Patience and/or more Irritation (representing dragging the conversation on)\n* On top of costs and basic effects, some cards may have additional affects (as with any good card game) in the form of keywords/tags. But since this is a dating sim, those very same keywords could net your points with your opponent, or lose you them. Like say maybe you play a ""Loud"" card that lets you immediately play a ""Gift"" card for fee, but maybe your waifu hates loud guys, so while you get that gift out for free you maybe get some Irritation in the process.\n* If there was ever an expansion it should be called ""Full Hands and Bigger Decks""\n* Other fun card/dating pun ideas: an uncensored/full NSFW patch/DLC called ""Uncut""; a draft mode called ""Feeling Drafty""\n\nI honestly love this idea. I came up with it last night and i thought about it more tonight, to the point of not being able to sleep. If I *could* make this myself, i definitely would. Hell i might just go and try at some point! But for now, it's just an idea"
hv47tb,"Yet another Dragon game post. Suddenly, ninjas!","So I’ve explained this before in the comments of my [very first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/dd3hdi/snes_style_game_with_a_story_based_on_shonen_anime/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x), but I never got any opinions so just like Erutika I’ll do it in a post.\n\nThis is another girl. Her name is Jitasa and she’s a kunoichi coyote. She was a temporary playable character in the 2nd chapter, but she became a full playable character to protect [Erutika](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/fx3fjg/another_post_about_my_dragon_game/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x), who she is best friends with.\n\nJitasa has a lot of gameplay aspects from multiple ninja games. She can double jump without unlocking it first, and she has the double dodge like Erutika does. She can crawl and slide kick just like Erutika. She can walk on water and can submerge into the water by pressing down. She can climb up walls and traverse on ceilings. While on a wall, pressing the opposite direction makes her look in said direction to either jump the opposite direction or attack. She can hang and traverse on certain platforms. While hanging on said platformer, Jitasa can ascend the platform by pressing up and descend back to hanging by pressing down.\n\nAs a ninja, Jitasa has a plethora of different weapons to choose from. Initially during the canon story she had bo-shuriken, her 2 magitech o-tanto she forged by herself, and her grappling hook. She can also use her hands with ki. One of Jitasa’s hand attacks is a ki infused palm strike, which can push the enemy off the screen basically, and it does cause a lot of damage. I do not know what her standard attacks with her o-tanto are, as I'm moving away from Marvel vs. Capcom style combos. In fact, I'm saving that style for a fighting game. Her grappling hook on the other hand can latch on to walls, which allows Jitasa to project herself towards the wall, and certain hooks or swingable objects which allow Jitasa to swing to the other side. While swinging, Jitasa can stop the swinging and she can either climb up the rope or slide down, and she can resume the swinging by pressing the left and right buttons. The grappling hook can also latch on to enemies, which Jitasa can pull them towards herself and stun them for a bit. Jitasa also has a dive kick, which she can do in any direction like in the Castlevania games, but she can also change the direction of her kick like Run Saber on the SNES. She also has a grab move, which is the Izuna Otoshi. Unlike the highly well known spinning pile driver, this version of the Izuna Otoshi is based on the (possible) source material: a late 60's anime called Ninpuu Kamui Gaiden. Jitasa can throw 3 bo-shuriken per button press, and she can throw it in a endless barrage like in MegaMan ZX with Model P. The Shuriken themselves, however, do very little damage to the enemy, as real shuriken don't kill the enemy. She has a lot of other weapons like a bow and a bunch of other weapons. I'm gonna have to look at a lot of them to see which ones suit her best.\n\nWhat do you think so far? This was a draft for a while since I don't have a really big brain and I didn't design her and the game's fighting system all the way."
hv34bs,Platformer where you need to expand the game world by adding new platforms,"Hi, it's a ""Mario-style"" 2d platformer game so I see gameplay as jumping-oriented (classical platformer). At start you have only few platforms and only one NPC - a settlement leader. As player you should grind/farm/find gold or some materials in this world and invest to the settlement economy to develop it and there will build new platforms so the game world will expand, new villagers will live on 2d platforms and you will have more space to find new gold.

hv1c42,a point and click adventure game about purgatory.,"the idea is that the game starts with you bleeding out and dying, as you drift into purgatory, the waiting room of the afterlife. the adventure consists of trying to get through the entire process of going to your afterlife which for some reason is so much harder for you than for the others here.\n\nmy idea is that through these series of events in purgatory you meet with the supreme grim reaper himself and as you walk in to request your coin he says ""what is this living soul doing here? put him back in the material plane!"" as you are sent back and wake up in the hospital, having been on the verge of death."

huvtra,A universal aiming system idea. [Updated version],
huuzdq,"you kobold, a game about being a tunneling trapsetting kobold.","you kobold has a simple premise, you kobold, kobold weak, kobold dig and set trap, adventurer want kill kobold, kobold not want die, dig and set trap, trap adventurer, trap adventurer?\n\nbeginning you have two main abilities, dig and craft, you can dig out a burrow to live in and craft things like traps and tools.\n\nas a kobold you are not very strong so it is highly advised to avoid direct combat, (unless you are fighting a single rat.) you should instead rely on traps to keep the adventurers at bay.\n\ni would also consider giving the game survival elements, like having to eat, your diet being mainly composed of mushrooms and rats (some mushrooms might make you dizzy).\n\nso yeah thats my game idea, simple but i think it could give some entertainment, what do you think?"
huu1xv,A Real Steel style Robot Boxing Game.,"To those of you of whom are unaware of the film I am taking massive inspiration see this IMDb listing;\n\n[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0433035/](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0433035/)\n\nIts a film about boxing robots and it stars Hugh Jackman.\n\nI personally really miss the Fight Night boxing video game series that was published by EA and developed by EA Vancouver.\n\nOf course it goes without saying that if this game was to be produced I wouldn't want EA to get their slimy paws on it, however onto the premise;\n\nSo like the film you'd start out with a crappy run down old hunker of a robot that is in dire need of repair and you'll drag it along to under-card fights, perhaps illegally hosted fights too, doing this will earn your character and team money, you can use this money to upgrade things for your robot and purchase cosmetics (I'm thinking mostly in game purchases as opposed to micro-transactions but the door is open there) and you'd upgrade similar things to fight night;\n\nThose being your resistance to getting punched, your strength, agility, (fight night had chin and heart but for Robots it should just be impact compensation or something) so like you could improve your robots suspension and handling as well as its on board computer allowing it to strategise fight plans more efficiently or something.\n\nThen as you progress through the under-card you could win like pink slips earning you new robots to fight with (as it is your team that will earn the trophy and your robot is just the face of your team, kinda like robot wars, the show on the BBC) and progress through the under-card until you are spotted and called to the actual big robot boxing league. (Feel free to name it whatever you like) and then you'll start climbing the ranks of the league to compete for the title. I believe that this would set the ground work for a decent multiplayer experience and could have players face off their own bots against yours.\n\nThis was my first post to this sub. As far as I am aware I have followed the rules, the only iffy one is rule 2 as I do liken this concept to Fight Night but I'm talking fighting robots not old ass retired boxers.,and it heavily leans on the film Real Steel, (don't mean to break rule 2 though) I'd love to hear your thoughts on it. I was just spitballing here this isn't a fleshed out idea but it is something I'd love to see as the closest thing we have to this is a cruddy mobile game based loosely on the film.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: Apparently there was a Real Steel game released for the Xbox 360 but digital only and Yukes discontinued it so I'd like to see somebody give the concept another crack even if it isn't officially a Real Steel game."
huor97,Game which repeats when you fail ala Source Code / Groundhog Day,"Hi y’all,\n\nMy idea for a game would be something similar to the movie Source Code.\n\nKeep the story pretty much the same - your character is in a situation which he can’t just walk away from (plane, train etc) and must stop something (in this case lets still go with a bomb).\n\nEverytime your character fails and the bomb explodes the game starts again and you’ve got to continuously try and get clues on each playthrough. And certain dialogue options / game options will open up because you learned something different on the previous run.\n\nI don’t know whether you’d go with the ‘character is in a computer reality’ to explain the time loop or don’t even bother explaining why ala Groundhog Day.\n\nAs for the main plot, 🤷‍♂️ - character trying to stop something and looping when he fails is all I thought out."

huo1bx,A crime thriller game set in a noir-themed 1980s city inhabited by gods and mythological monsters,"It's the turn of a new century, the old gods have moved into the noir-themed city. Monsters and supernaturals roam the streets, while mythological deities control the city's infrastructure and economy, battling for every scrap they can get. \n\nYou play as a fledging demigod trying to make it big, and develop your own Pantheon /Empire. Players can explore the city GTA style (possibly Isometric &amp; pixel art to make it easier) \n\nYou can go on missions to claim territories, solve mysteries and unlock new artifacts of power. The city also has its own warring factions, made out of different pantheon that the player can align with (or fight) \n\nThe trick is, the infrastructure you capture can also serve as a base for your godly powers. Want to be like Zeus? Control the electricity supply in the city."
hulyjg,Turn Based Strategy Firefighting game,"Like X-Com, but instead of alien-fighting soldiers, you get firefighters. You can have specialisms, like the guy who bashes through walls, the medic, the hoseperson. Set it 10 years into the future, so you can have X-Ray goggles and the works.\n\nTo win a level, you have to put the fire out or rescue all of the trapped people. Different levels for different fires. Could add a long term plot arc that you're chasing an arsonist or something, or maybe that your team gets promoted to a larger city or similar. \n\nI like the idea of games without guns, and this could be a nifty chance to be part of that. \n\nAlso, it could be a mod for X-Com, saving some dev time.\n\n(If you take this idea please  don't forget me, as I'm broke and wont be able to buy a copy, and I'd love to play it)."

hui4sw,"A multilayer raid type wherein the final boss isn't one your squad is meant to beat, but one so unstoppable that the goal is to run away and frantically escape from with your life.","Your squad just beat a massive boss to collect tons of loot and xp but, as you're celebrating, an even larger overleveled boss with a ludicrous health pool drops from the skylight and starts chasing out of his winding lair.\n\nThe boss's attacks would telegraph and be designed to require skill for avoiding damage, but it would hit hard. Damaging him only slows him down. The dungeon/lair for these raid types would also be designed specifically to be engaging during this escape sequence, with some tight corridors, some open rooms with delayed exit doors, some with pitfalls, etc.\n\nOnly one player in the team has to reach the escape craft/exit for everyone to win, but anyone that died will have lost a small portion of their loot."
hugvxz,I believe my dragon game's fight system is not necessarily good for a platformer. Are there any old school games or other games I can take notes from?,"Here's this post for context: [https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/dd3hdi/snes\_style\_game\_with\_a\_story\_based\_on\_shonen\_anime/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/dd3hdi/snes_style_game_with_a_story_based_on_shonen_anime/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)\n\nInitially I wanted to have a fight system similar to Marvel vs. Capcom or Devil May Cry, but I soon realized that it probably wouldn't be a good idea for a platformer. Especially for one that's supposed to emulate a SNES on steroids.\n\nI also need help with 3 other characters. Their names are Raiguko, Jitasa, and Kentori.\n\nRaiguko is a rebellious biker who goes against the law when it comes to killing criminals as long as he's not law enforcement or associated with the law at all. He has a lot of guns and also has a demon form (no, this guy is not a Dante ripoff. In fact, I'm trying to make him completely different from Dante). He has a double-barreled lever-action shotgun, a uzi inspired machine pistol, a large desert eagle inspired hand gun, and a grenade launcher. He also possesses pyrokinesis. I honestly don't know how I'm going to make him function with all of these, especially since I don't want him to be like [Erutika](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/fx3fjg/another_post_about_my_dragon_game/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x).\n\nThen there's Jitasa, which I have a draft of her post. She has a lot of weapons, because she's a ninja. I want to give her a grappling hook, but there's also her other weapons and tools like her shuriken and daggers.\n\nKentori is a similar boat. I also want to give him a grappling hook, but then idk what to do with his nunchaku, sword, and other weapons.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince I mentioned Erutika, I actually found one function that can make her unique from a MegaMan copy. A hostage/living shield move.  \n\n\nI found this off a platformer named Phantom 2040, but I also found it from Gears of War. It's basically Erutika getting behind a opponent (primarily a man or a demon soldier), put them in a hold, and use them as a shield. What you can do with the opponent is either execute them John Wick style or just throw 'em."

hu9fgo,What do YOU like about FPS,
hu9di3,Cooperative Asymmetrical Online FPS,"Cooperative Asymmetrical Online FPS\nPlayers: 19 + 2 special units with different roles\n(Posted this on Discord a few months back)\n\nA group of 20 players must defend a run down base on a alien planet from 10 waves of AI enemies of increasing difficulty. \nThe base starts as a bare bones installation: equipment is broken, walls are collapsed and doors don't shut down properly. Between each wave every player gets resources to upgrade the base (on a timer till next wave). Each player must decide where to spend the resources gained. If the repairs and upgrades are done in a non-strategic way, they may be ineffective to stop the incoming wave.\nPlayers will assume different roles that have different responsabilities during the setup and attack phases. These could be:\nAssault\nHeavy\nSniper\nEnginner\nMedic\n\nThe Enginner will be able to build and repair all types of structures. The medic will be able to build medical or supply structures. All others can build only some reinforcements and traps and repair walls. The engineer will receive the most building resources every turn and will be able to build faster. Other units will have more combat focused skills.\n\nEvery match will have a special unit called the Traitor (randomly selected from the group of 20 players). That unit will effectively be working against the other players. Instead of building they will be able to jam and set timed explosives in structures.\nThe identity of the Traitor will be unknown to others. They will look exactly like other classes. You can't attack the traitor directly but you can tag someone as suspicious. If a player gets enough suspicious tags he/she will be tagged as “Traitor"" and have friend-friendly fire enabled. This will happen wether the player is really the traitor or not so picking a traitor is a very important group decision. If you pick it wrong you just reduced the effectiveness of your own team (and still will have a traitor in the group). The common number of traitors will be 1/20 but there will be rare matches with 0 or 2 Traitors. Although you can select if you wish to be randomly selected as the traitor you will have no other control over it. The traitor will have its own skill tree to upgrade. \n\nThe second special unit is the Monster unit. Again, selecting this unit is totally out of control of the player. This unit plays completely diferently than other units. They will appear at the enemies spawn camp and will look just like any other enemy except for the fact that it is player controlled and not AI. This unit will have unique abilities akin to the enemy abilities. The Monster will be able to identify the traitor and can choose not to attack him/her (or it can even choose to attack him/her to keep appearances). Being player-controlled means that the tactics used this unit can be unique and they can have abilites to indirectly influence the form of attack of the swarm (tag a weak point, for example). Also, the monster can attack at any time and is not bound by the timed regular swarm of aliens attack.\n\nIn the Lobby you pick your Player Class, Traitor Skills and Monster skills and them you are randomly assigned but may choose to never be Traitor or Monster OR more likely to be Traitor or Monster."
hu8z04,"You are an A.I; control an office building, slowly take control, and improve efficiency.","This is a game I plan on making, and was wondering what people thought\n\nYou play as an A.I with control of certain functions in a skyscraper, tasked with ""optimising the businesses profit"". At first you have limited control, manually overriding lifts, toggling lights, but by using this control you can influence different people in the building to gain more power. Specifically, you would want to negatively affect parts of the business so that these powers are given over to you instead. For example, say you want to take control of the hiring of new employees: you could take over the elevator to prevent potential hires from reaching their destination, so no new employees are hired. This reflects negatively on the HR department so more of their power is given to you.\n\nYour success would be measured by how much power each department has left (the departments perhaps being HR, IT, Advertising, and Production) and you would lose if the manager becomes too ""suspicious"" of you.\n\nThe game would be from a side view of the building, with employees walking back and forth, similar to the style of Project Highrise.\n\nIm not sure if this sounds like an unrealistic idea, but I have put some thought into how it would be achieved, different heads of department having levels of suspicion, efficiency, etc, and lots of things you could gain control over (hiring, firing, targeted advertising, automated production lines, and more processing power (slow time) to name a few). Different departments would give power over different things, HR would allow you to remove inefficient people, IT would improve the hadware hosting the AI, and with Advertising and Production you would increase the companies profit (which reflects well on you).\n\nAs I said I plan on making this so feedback/critique is very welcome. Please ask for clarification if needed, I'm not sure how well I've explained some of my ideas and I'm typing this without the notes I made on it."
hu7rgm,A salemSalem witch trials game,So hear me out I’ve never posted my ideas for games cuz I get shit for it  but how about a game where you play during the Salem witch trials not as a point to point history it actually has witches and you investigate witch sighting you fight witches and you can either kill them on spot or capture them and have them hang it gets you more rep for the town if you hang on spot but Theres a chance they can escape  more rep better weapons and more trust in town and have some twist like the mayor is a witch in disguise or something
hu72dy,African GTA,"Imagine living all gangster, like you're in America. But you're in the ghetto of high-rise cities in Africa. We have heavy political satire, where people are let down their entire lives. People dying due to unreliable healthcare and poor children and adults on the outskirts of the cities in shanty towns. Terrorists are now part of the situation; and so are soldiers because of political unrest. Despite all of this on the other end are the people living rich from exploitation of workers who work for peanuts to support families. These are people living in beautiful parts of the city with illuminated lights and have houses that no-one would imagine. They don't use hospitals in Africa - they go abroad. Then there's sex workers - women who will not take a second thought at giving up their bodies to feed their families. Alternatively they're those who live abroad and come to start their businesses which always seem to make massive profits. With 10+ cars well over a million dollars each and others who are actually living in the middle class - making up 30% of the population. Very little rich people and over 60% unemployed poor people forming gangs and attacking (killing) those who aren't from the same country as them. \n\nSetting: Fictional Name For African Country, based off South Africa, Nigeria, Ghana and other elements of various African countries.\n\nOk, now we have the rough settings and lore. You are a foreigner in the country coming here for university studies. Long story short, university is attacked by terrorists, there's some civil unrest and you end up doing jobs for people to learn a living. These include gangs, military, government (separate from military) and rich people. The game will involve some elements of satirical pain, when your girlfriend dies due to poor healthcare. Oh and lets not forget about the abundant access to melee weapons. Here guns are used a lot, but lets not forget the common man, having knives in their socks or blatantly walking around with cutlasses and work tools. Ascending from nothing to big-time would really be seen here. You start off as a student on campus which closes down and then go to shanty, then manageable, and then middle-class, until you live rich! Political leaders even send you on missions to make sure the elections are rigged.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMain mission of the game is to make sure the government remains as leaders or join opposition parties in a coup. Keep off the terrorists or go head on. Or just get to the top of the ladder and end it there.\n\nP.S I'm from Africa, so this is just my experience living here my whole life and an attempt to convey what really goes down."
hu70os,VR vs. PC players raid style battles with match making,"The person in VR would be a giant boss type enemy while a group of 10 players on a normal PC setup would work together to take them down. Think MMO style raid battles but with match making.\n\nThis would be awesome because only one person in a group of friends would need to have VR for them all to play the game, and it would help get more people who don't have a VR setup interacting with the VR space and seeing the tech in action. It would also solve the issue of VR online match making taking forever because there are few people with VR."

hu22f1,Survival Royale,"You start with a 100 random players randomly spaced out. Friendly fire on. Find and pick up weapons, items, buffs, etc. The trick is that other players aren't the only danger. There are monsters, disasters, spies (npcs who pretend to be players), etc. So you can play it just like a battle royale but you won't get anywhere since a monster will kill you. So when you see another player, you'll try and team up with them to survive the monsters. Plus, there's a buff limit so you can't cover all bases just by yourself. But there is still that betrayal element since you do get some benefits from PvP. You'll have to balance cooperative play with competitive pray, all while watching your back because betrayal can happen at any moment. The goal is to survive as long as possible."
hu1hgn,Morphing zombies,"So I had this awesome vivid dream last night which was liked me watching either a developer diary showcasing their game or an advertisement video. \n\nI don't remember most of the video of the game's features but basically it's another zombie survival game and the last part really stood out because of how incredibly vivid and awesome the visuals were.\n\nThe character was sneaking around in a house looking for loot while the narrator was explaining that as the game progresses it gets harder because the zombies randomly morph with each other or any animal that's nearby into a bigger more powerful entity that may also get additional powers.\n\nAt this point the character made a noise that alerted nearby zombies and they start bursting out of doors and even smashing through walls to reach the character and some of them are twisted morphed zombies, think of the movie The Thing for an idea of what that looks like. So the character starts trying to flee the scene because it's so overwhelming as more and more zombies from the distance are now rushing over too, many in various states of morphing.\n\nThen the video pauses as you see this distant glowing head towering high above everything else  and the narrator is like uh oh this isn't good. And he explains how these things can just keep morphing and morphing into bigger and badder creatures. And this guy is the culmination of the process.\n\nHe unpauses and the character continue to try and flee but this huge mega creature is quickly catching up with his giant foot steps - a foot alone is the size of the character and his face reminded me of the game of thrones white Walker. \n\nMy dream ended when the character was running through a church trying to find refuge but this creature just stepped over it and crushed the whole thing around them.\n\nWas really cool!"

htzqeu,Colorblind the game,"I was reading up on Euler's life work and some recent advances in cyber-security, and it inspired me, so I had the idea for a video or board game based on the four color problem and information verification called ""colorblind"". I thought it was an interesting concept.\n\nTwo players each have access to a polyhedron, either physical or virtual. The polyhedron is colored with up to 7 colors with each polyhedron using at least two colors. Player one can see the polyhedron. Player two is blindfolded but allowed to hold the polyhedron. In the video game version, the second player would see numbered faces. Player two is allowed to point to a face of the polyhedron and ask the color. Player one can tell the truth or a falsehood. Player two is then allowed to rotate the polyhedron however she feels fit. Player two can now point to a face and ask what color the face has. Player one again can tell a truth or a lie. This continues until player two is satisfied. Player two, once satisfied guesses how many colors the polyhedron is colored with. If player two is correct, player two wins a point. Players alternate guesser and play with different polyhedrons and coloring until one player has 5 points."
htyutt,2D Builder/Adventurer,"Is technology there to create a world builder + adventure multiplayer game?\n\nI was wondering would it be possible and how much would it cost to create and upkeep a game where someone is creating villages/towns/cities while someone else is playing an adventurer going from town to town to wreck havoc or help or just trade. \n\nPlease check out Rimworld and Dwarf fortress to understand a bit better what im about to say.\n\n# 1. Building aspect of the game\n\nSo for the building aspect I was thinking something like Rimworld/Dwarf Fortress (2D and grid based). Where you semi-control your people to build up your town and keep them happy. In Rimwold you can be a brutal and a savage ruler (selling organs, having slaves...) or the most peaceful civilization the world has ever seen. I would love to keep the complexity of Rimworld/Dwarf Fortress.\n\nIn this multiplayer game I was thinking other players could attempt to raid you, trade with you, be your allies but in real time not like Clash of Clans type of thing. The damage to your base is permanent and so on. \n\nMaybe after you reach a certain people count you can join a player controlled faction that is allies/enemies with other factions so that there are always enemies and friends. \n\nIn Rimworld you can generate an entire planet. For the purpose of being playable in this multiplayer game we can split continents or countries to different servers or something like that.\n\n# 2. Adventure aspect of the game\n\nYou could start base building and after a certain point send out some of your people to adventure to other peoples bases or old abandoned ones or maybe even empty tiles on the map while having full control over them (still 2D and grid based) like Dwarf fortress adventure mode. You can steal, burn crops, help and soo on. While an adventurer has full control over his people, the builder only has semi-control so you can try and start a mutiny because the town is low on something (which the adventurer would have to find out somehow)... Or maybe just start out as an adventurer if you dont like the building aspect.\n\n# 3. The Question\n\nNow this wouldn't have to be the prettiest game, just that its complex like Rimworld/Dwarf Fortress but has a built in multiplayer aspect. I think a lot of people would play this type of game and with technology today its not that far of a reach for a bigger company or maybe I am totally wrong? Add you own ideas and assumptions, this has been on my mind for the longest time and I would love to hear other peoples opinion."

htwlrl,A soul possession game,"I have two game ideas, but the premise is the same.\n\nGame idea #1:Roguelike, but there is no healing.Instead you play as a ""soul"" that has the ability to hop between monsters.You start as monster-A and you can fight and everything, but you can't heal.So you have to possess another monster (that has more hp), and leave your previous body begin to die.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGame idea #2:Multiplayer deathmatch. You have a room with 100 stationary turrets.The player is an ""A.I."" on one of the turrets.They can upload themselves into other non-player-possessed turrets, to move around the level.Or they can shoot the turret if they think it's a player, but by doing so they might out themselves as a player to other players."

htsh1a,Need ideas for a Jak and Daxter style platformer,I'm making a platformer that I want to be similar to classic platformers like the Jak and Daxter series or  Ratchet and Clank. I need ideas for the plot. I want it to be a mix of light and humorous but also serious and about good vs evil. Maybe along the lines of overthrowing a tyrannical government. Anyone have any ideas? Doesn't matter if it's too cliche.
htsdk0,I wish there were Gacha or hero collector games that weren't tied to in game stoes/mobile markets/etc.,"Because they make money a certain way they are all pretty much the same and follow the same gameplay loop formulas.  I actually like the idea of collecting heroes and upgrading them, but I don't like how heavily 99% of these games are gated towards getting you to spend as much RL money as possible.\n\nI remember games like suikoden, shining force, fftactics, to some smaller extent even hyrule warriors, let you collect and upgrade heroes.\n\nI don't think I've found a gacha/hero collector game out there that didn't follow the same mind numbing money grubbing gameplay loop games like raid shadow legends follow."
hts8gg,"""Altar of Reason"" An eldritch horror game set during the French revolution's Reign of Terror.","The Reign of Terror was one of the most tragic, horrific periods in human history. Nearly 17,000 people were officially executed by the guillotine and 10,000 more died ""unofficially"" from countless other atrocities. At it's height, 800 people a month were publicly executed by the national razor.\n\nThroughout this single year, highly charismatic and eccentric individuals stoke the fires of madness to a fever pitch: The Committee of Public Safety has spies and agents planted all over Paris, Jean-Paul Marat writes hateful, radical publications calling for ever more heads, and Maximilien Robespierre begins to hear whispers from the ""The Goddess of Reason"".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn this game, I think I would have you would play as a catholic monk whose monastery in rural France was consumed during the Terror. Alone and thirsting for divine retribution, you enter Paris and learn dark truths surrounding the heart of the revolution. You would confront a variety of historical figures, exaggerated and twisted with eldritch horror, and eventually uncover a grand plot centered on the guillotine and the being it feeds."
htqvah,A Stellaris-like persistent world multiplayer RTS with .io game mechanics,"So I've been thinking of a concept that I think is pretty cool, although it may be hard to execute due to the requirement of a large player base to keep it fun (like all multiplayer games that don't use bots).\n\nBasically, you start out as a small race of aliens that strive for galactical domination, then technological ascendency, the ultimate goal.\n\nYou will progress technologically, colonize worlds, and battle other players all in a persistent, real-time galaxy. A basic diplomacy system might help to take down larger players (alliances, treaties, etc.)\n\nThe game will be played in one sitting, to force you to adapt to different starting conditions since you will be doing that quite frequently.\n\nEvery player who quits might have ""artifacts"" of their civilization left over for newer civilizations to find, and possibly exploit to turn the tide of a war, for example.\n\nI'd like to hear your opinion, and maybe even a possibility to make this happen (although unlikely). Maybe you know of a game that is similar to this, so be sure to let me know!"

htmsjo,A Terminator video game where you play as one of Skynet's Terminators.,"There are several modes to this game, which on their own are sort of similar to existing games, but together is quite original.\n\nThe main story mode: you are a T-800 sent back to eliminate some key Resistance figures. In each level you have a different target whom you must kill to progress. About halfway through, you have a mission to kill the faction leader, but they reprogram you. Now you are on the other side, and you must destroy other Terminators sent to finish the job you failed.\n\nTime trial mode: You are in a busy street and have a number of targets. When you get the first target, they will remain until terminated, at which point the next target appears. This continues until all are terminated, and achievements are granted based on how quick you are.\n\nMultiplayer versus: 4 players, either split screen or online, and there are 4 characters to choose: T-800 (Arnie), T-1000 (Judgement Day), TX (T3) or Rev-9 (Dark Fate). This is a simple versus mode with respawns; first player to however many points wins, and points are granted by terminating opponents."
htmd4e,Hidden,"Buckle up because this could be insanely complicated...\n\nYour grandfather has recently passed, and you've been left with very little, a letter, and a strange looking key with a symbol on it. Opening up your map, there's a single area highlighted, some old temple, like Mayan or Aztek. You travel there, and look around the temple, eventually finding the keyhole with that same symbol. Using the key reveals a hidden [puzzle box](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5sZYv3edNE).\n\nThere are a number of puzzle boxes in every location, more as you progress, and each box gets more complex. To solve a map, you must solve all the boxes, revealing a new key once you solve the last box, sending you to a new location on the map.\n\nThe boxes are 3d, and can be rotated, and flipped. Different boxes reveal clues/objects to open other boxes, all kept in your inventory for that map. You don't finish one box, and move on. You must solve all the boxes with clues off of them, and the other boxes, going back and forth between them.\n\nOnce you solve a map, the name you've chosen gets posted online (IRL vial login) with the map's location, and the time it took you to finish it (updating if you do better next time), and the same thing happens when you complete the entire game.\n\nThe puzzle box group for that map are procedurally generated, so you can play the game again for a new experience, and so you don't just keep getting faster and faster, making the online results unfair. Along with the key to the next map, you will receive a single item (randomized) from that civilization inside the box, wearable on your online avatar, or used to alter your profile/handle image. Some can be the equivalent of a 'foil card' collector's item, a rare 'drop'. Some can even be in-game items that you never lose, that help you decypher certain puzzles, or add new ones."
htbx5r,A pvp stealth game!,"Say there are a total of 20 characters. Each character is categorized specifically for each class: Rogues, agents, supports.. Etc.\n\n2 players engage in a 1v1 game mode! Each player choose 5 characters from above. Players have a couple of goals to achieve victory.\n\nEither by collecting the ultra secret data from a computer, or by defeating all 5 enemies which the other player controls.\n\nIt is a turned based game where  players can have up to five moves in a single round. The player then decides how to make the best out of these 5 moves:\n\nWhat's below is basically an example of what one player can do in a single round with 5 moves each round:\n\n ( moving a character five blocks to enter a certain room to ambush the enemy, the second move is going to be one of the characters which has the ability to control a robot that has a chance of revealing enemies in a certain area.\n\nThe third move could be the support character where it can throw a bag of medkit to nearby ally character to eaither heals it or hold it for later heal.)\n\nAnd so on till the player finishes his 5 turns. Then it is time for the other player to make his 5 moves...\n\nThe game requires you to practice the huge amount of synergies possible between characters and their interactions to one another by either skills or dialogs, predictions could turn the tables too. The design of different maps should also be complex and fair.\n\nWhat do you think?"

Try to keep a clear workspace.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlayers are scored on the time it takes them to do the job, and how thorough they are about recycling vs trashing the parts.\n\nPlayers can easily just carve apart a ship into bite-sized chunks and hurl each piece into a disintegrator, but they lose points for not recycling useful parts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlayers should be shutting off power, draining plasma and fuel lines and generally tidying up, then cutting things apart and sorting the parts into salvage (like functional components, simple materials and suchlike) and trash (useless scrap like ruined carpets and blown lightbulbs)\n\nThe environment is a star-trek starship-cradle-like arrangement wrapped in a forcefield that contains any debris.\n\nWrecked ships can be seen floating in the distance, some of them apparently being dismantled.  \n\n\nSome ships are more complex and involved than others, eg: the first levels might just be small sections of a ship, or a damaged shuttlecraft. Later levels might be ruined pieces of a capital ship.  \n\n\nSpecial levels might include dismantling a captured alien ship, which comes with all kinds of its own hazards.  \n\n\nDeal with hazards, such as:\n\n* plasma-relays filled with superheated plasma (don't cut into these unless you want to get burned)\n* Radioactive materials\n* active power lines which will zap you if you try to cut them or touch them\n* Aggressive alien flora and/or fauna that has colonised the ship and needs burning away\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTools:\n\n* Cutting Torch (separate parts, use as impromptu flamethrower)\n* Laser Cutter (better torch with longer range, also useful as a weapon against alien critters)\n* Plasma Siphon - Drains superheated plasma from pipes\n* Fuel Siphon - Drains fuel from tanks\n* Graviton Manipulator (HL2 style gravity gun for picking up and moving heavy objects)\n* Wire Reels - For storing cable as you pull it off the walls.\n* Bolt-cutters - for cutting bolts and cabling\n* Torque-Wrench, for unbolting components and beating aliens.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEnvironmental Tools:\n\n* Work-Bee for moving large objects.\n* Disintegrator Array for disposing of trash elements.\n* Recycling crusher\n* Component Storage (for still-functional system components taken from the wreckage)\n* Individual storage of reusable types of material, such as cabling and trunking."

hzq5bx,"Hey guys, looking for anybody who’d be interested in making a game!","*Note: skip to end for important disclaimer*\n\nHey Reddit, me and a friend came up with a pretty interesting idea for a game and kept adding to it until we reached a point where we thought it was too good of an idea to waste. So we’ve decided we’re actually gonna make it! \n\nThe game: The game will have a 2 1/2D design (think Playdead’s *Inside*) and will follow a young girl fleeing a war torn country. The general theme will be dark and without going into much detail the story will show themes of innocence, loss and darkness. That’s all we can say on this platform :) \n\nWhat we’re looking for is anyone who’d be interested in joining us in its creation. If you’re a blender pro, or a unity beginner, we want your help. The game currently has no following and no set release date meaning all we’re looking for are people willing to work on this whenever they feel like it. \n\nDisclaimer/s: \n\n• I’ll get the big one out the way: *This is unpaid* however anyone involved in the creation process *will receive a cut of the game’s total earnings* if/when it’s released. We think this is fair as we have no compulsory hours or deadlines for you to work on, we’re genuinely just looking for help from people enthused by games looking to help make one. \n\n• You don’t require any skill level, that being said this isn’t to be mistaken for some kind of class in how to use Blender, the Unity Engine or any other tools used in the production of the game. You’ll be responsible for teaching yourself as no one currently involved (myself included) is a pro at any of the pieces of software mentioned above. \n\n• You’ll receive a further description of the game if you’d like to help create it, as it’s a good idea and something we’re actively working on, we’re keeping it close to our chest for the time being. \n\nAnd that’s about it, if you’re at all interested please send me a PM and we’ll take the next few steps, if you have any questions feel free to either PM me or leave a comment below. \n\nThis is a project and a dream of mine we’ve had for a while and it’d be awesome to actually start making it a reality, I’m looking forward to any messages I receive from you guys :)"

hzlsnj,Amphibitious,"  Imagine a game similar to the survival game rust, only the player when spawning in can choose to be an aquatic animal, a land animal, or a volant animal. This game harbors each creature with pros and cons and leaves the player to choose what they like and how they like to play.   \n\n\n  This game would bring things to the table, such as player verse player combat, factions, base building, adventuring, and role-playing. Different things would be possible with different species. Humans can wear armor and carry guns. Harpys can fly around at high speeds and have a great sense of hearing, merfolk can breathe underwater and swim quickly, as well as being able to see very well in the dark.   \n\n\n  To balance the species, and create diversity, each type would have to have a downside. So the obvious ""go anything other than human"" is out the window. Humans, of course, can't breathe under the water, and can't fly, but they can of course have machines.   \nHarpys can of course fly around, but carrying heavy objects makes this impossible. Their bodies are also incredibly light to fit for flying, and in turn, they are very week and have a low amount of health.  \nMerfolk can't use any kind of tech, as you might have guessed, electricity and water don't go very well together.  \n\n  This game could also feature things such as a building mechanic, and many places for you to find loot, as well as maybe mystical abilities, and stat changes. I don't know though, just an idea."

hzef3u,A combat enemy level mechanic idea?,"Watched a video of a guy trying a level display mod for Skyrim, and discovering how strong certain people were, which got me thinking. A level display that shows the enemies “guessed” level, based on your experience and knowledge. Say you are talking to the almighty god warrior of your village, it would display for example 50+, or ??? If miles ahead of you, or if you have prior heard stories comparable to other people or creatures, you know between 30-76, as you play and meet more you get a consistent average amount at common things, get better at identifying from first glance, so your ability to know opponents levels and or strengths and weaknesses is an asset of the game. If this has been done before, which I’m sure I’ve seen it done for certain bosses or whatever, then just tell me to shut up"
hzedfb,Looking for ideas for classes in a 2d co-op RPG,"I’ve been thinking about a 2d pixel RPG and I’ve thought out most of the mechanics and story, but when I got to the classes in the game my brain just stopped working.

hzczam,[Request] Need an idea with these preferences,"I have some ideas in my mind, but I just cannot put them together. The idea doesnt have to contain everything I list because it's impossible to, these are just small things I want into it.\n\n# Should contain collecting\n\n* I love collecting stuff and many people do. Completing a collection can be very satisfying and give the player reasons to collect more. \n* I have a concept in my mind. You have a collectible and inside of that, you can fully ""upgrade"" that one collectible thing by doing challenges. So you can collect stuff and you can collect stuff inside the stuff. The closest example I have is from a game many people won't remember, but in Viva Pinata, you had animals and inside them you had to do different challenges *(like feeding them with another animal)* and you ultimately reached the point of reproduction, and you ticked that off in your book, where you ""collected"" these animals and challenges. You also had to find 3 color variations of them to master them. Maybe this is what gave me collecting addiction as a child.\n* It also should have an extremely rare legendary collection of things. It will give players a goal for game completion, and also mystery *(what happens if I finish the legendary set?)*\n* I had the idea to collect different types of cards, but I just cannot figure out how do you actually get them\n\n# Choice driven story\n\n* I lot of games do this, but not on a huge scale. In Witcher 3 and fresher RPG games, you get dialog choices which will have an effect on the next few minutes or hours of your game. I can understand why on a small scale, if you get too many choices, you will definitely have to exponentially work more on the game, but I can take that. I want one choice to effect the whole story, and I want multiple of them, and I'm not afraid of designing 100+ different story paths. I think it's art and it's also ""collecting"" in some way.\n* Problem is, I have no idea if I'm good at writing stories. I definitely cannot think of an interesting character I haven't seen before, so I guess not, but I can get external help for this easily.\n* This probably won't work for reasons I will list later on, but I don't have the graphical ability to create faces, or realistic 3d characters. A story with objects? Probably not a good idea. But I may see it work, maybe people are space ships or something.\n\n# Graphical requirements (+ my skill level on a scale of 10)\n\n **What I** ***can*** **do:**\n\n* 2d photoshop graphics *(8)*\n* 2d pixelart *(5)*\n* 3d small object model graphics *(6)*\n* Pretty 2d light effect animations *(9)*\n\n**What I** ***cannot*** **do:**\n\n* 3d people\n* Animations (maybe 2d a little bit)\n\nI know its very slim but I made games before and the graphics were good. You can do most stuff with photoshop.\n\nI also know my 3d is weak, but I can manage it on a small scale. It can be a mix. You can collect stuff in a 2d game, and the collection can easily be 3d.\n\nIt should preferably be a mobile game, just because I feel like the desktop gaming industry is too big for me, but it won't stop a good idea if it only works on PC.\n\nAny idea is appreciated."

Then there are open world like parts where you just go through 1890s new York or edo period tokyo.\n\n\nI mean games have the great advantage over movies that you can actively participate in historical events and that developers can accurately recreat cities nowadays.

The idea i had is basically a colony sim game but in first person.   \n\n\nYou would be lost in a planet with what is left of your rescue shuttle and and some materials. There would also be other colons with you. You're their leader so they expect you to give orders and plan the colony expansion. The things you can build would be pretty similar to what you can find in these type of games along with the gameplay mechanics but the first person perspective would offer a much more immersive experience as you would litterally play one of the colonist and you would be able to walk through your settlement and see the AI colonists live their life.\n\nGiving orders to the other colonists could be done with a ""command room"" where you'll be able to navigate through a tactical map. This map would allow stuff like exploration, mineral extraction, expeditions (for finding survivors, attack other settlement or alien life, trade etc...). Construction orders could be done by placing building ghosts the same way you build in satisfactory, or also through a closeup map of the settlement.\n\nThe real important part would be to be able to grow massive. To start with very few colonist and be able to end up with 50-60 AI colonists.\n\nFuture updates could provide new classic features we can find in these type of games (nutrition, skill training, research, diseases, random events, ...)."
hyw7yt,Would you guys be interested in a RPG where you manipulate time?,"Would you this be an interesting game mechanic? You try to collect fragments of a clock that was destroyed by something. By collecting collect fragments, you gain the power to manipulate through time. \nYou venture through a world, discovering new places, while fighting enemies that all have different abilities that can manipulate time and warp through space. \nYou collect weapons from different bosses and chest. Different weapons would use different abilities that your clock posses and these abilities will become stronger etc as you collect more clock fragments. \nYou could unlock different special moves as you collect clock pieces. Such as: being able to dash through time and rewind time when wielding a sword; be able to slam the ground and send enemies back in time when wielding a hammer; send enemies into different dimensions when wielding an axe, etc. \nAs you progress through the game, completing quests and defeating enemies and bosses, you collect resources to forge different weapons and unlocking different abilities.\nYou slowly discover how this all happened by discovering memories from the past. Soon you discover different biomes where you find npcs from your memories. \nThese npcs give you guidance on how to “fix” time. At the end you use all of your abilities with the help of clock to defeat the final boss."
hysmfn,"Rise of Nations / Civilization mixture, whole world real time strategy game","First of all, I love realistic strategy games. It may seem that RoN is anyhow Civ alike but imagine a game, where everything happens in real time and you have control over everything at any time (single units, buildings etc.). The game logic is mostly like civilization, where you slowly colonize and progress until you reach borders with other nations. But all in real time. Each ""unit"" should be a costly resource. Waging massive wars should be dangerous as getting weaker (worsening economy! and loss of man power) will expose you to other threats and may lead to annihilation. Therefore, good politics and diplomacy is very important (especially at this age of AI this should be possible). Accessing strategic resources on the map and making trade deals should be of key importance. (I hated in older Civs that you couldn't trade a lot, which isn't realistic imo. I don't know how it is in newer Civs). Also a massive world! Conquering the whole world needs to be extremely difficult. Goal should be to become a dominant power and preserving that + tech race of course. Like in modern age, sometimes smaller military operations are better than big wars (capturing a strategic small town or resource for example) or punishing another country with a short aggression. And lot's of details, culture, religion, capitalism/communism, historical issues (arch enemies?), unions! (e.g. EU, NATO alike), environment (Civ3 and 4 had global warming :D).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do you think?

hyri4j,ALIEN - an asymmetrical 6v1 multiplayer,"# SUMMARY\n\n*An asymmetrical survival horror game for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation, and Xbox. The game is heavily inspired by fellow asymmetrical titles such as Dead by Daylight, Evolve, and Friday the 13th.* \n\n*Exclusively designed as a one versus six (1v6) multiplayer experience, a group of six survivors must elude the stealthy alien and escape the map. Whereas the Xenomorph player must try to either kill or kidnap the survivors and prevent them from escaping.*\n\n*Alongside a handful of the original Alien characters, this game will also include unlockable and DLC characters.* \n\n*It will contain semi-open world maps in which the players can explore (at their own peril), with plenty of Easter eggs and nods for both die-hard and softcore fans to discover and enjoy. These maps will be set in known locations of the Alien franchise.*\n\n# SURVIVORS\n\n*Players can assume the role as one of many survivors in the ALIEN franchise, including Ellen Ripley, Arthur Dallas,  Joan Lambert, Dennis Parker, Carter Burke, Lance Bishop, Annalee Call, Ripley 8, and more. Each survivor has a unique set of abilities and flaws.*\n\n*The goal of the Survivors is to* ***ESCAPE*** *or* ***DESTROY THE NEST****.*\n\n***ESCAPE*** *is achieved by performing a series of tasks, such as bypassing flight terminals or retrieving components to repair damaged hardware. Depending on the map, the Survivors can then either call for an evacuation or access the emergency lifeboat.*\n\n***DESTROY THE NEST*** *is much more difficult to accomplish but offers more rewards in return. Per the above, a series of tasks must be completed, such as obtaining fuel canisters or accessing restricted areas. Depending on the map, the Survivors can then either:*\n\n* ***BLOW THE NEST UP*** *- If successful, a cutscene will happen in which a fiery explosion engulfs the alien nest, forcibly ending the match as a victory for the Survivors.*\n* ***CALL FOR A BUG HUNT*** *- If successful, all Survivors will respawn as Colonial Marines. Using powerful firearms and munitions, the players must destroy the nest and kill the Xenomorph player.*\n* ***OPEN THE AIRLOCK*** *- If successful, a cutscene will happen in which an airlock door opens, sucking everything out into space and forcibly ending the match as a victory for the Survivors.*\n\n*The Survivor movement options consist of walking, sprinting, or crouch-walking. They must elude the Xenomorph by sneaking or hiding from it using lockers, tables, ventilation shafts, and more.*\n\n*Survivors are played in First-Person.*\n\n# XENOMORPH\n\n*Players can also assume the role of a Xenomorph in currently two variants, including the DRONE and the RUNNER (with more planned later). Each Xenomorph has its own unique set of abilities and flaws.*\n\n*The goal of the Xenomorph is to* ***KILL*** *or* ***ABDUCT THE SURVIVORS*** *(A combination of both methods can be used to achieve a victory).*\n\n***KILLING THE SURVIVORS*** *is achieved by switching attack preference to Lethal Strike. The Xenomorph player will then be able to pounce on a target and execute that individual with a special killing move.*\n\n***ABDUCTING THE SURVIVORS*** *offers more rewards. It is achieved by switching attack preference to Non-Lethal Strike and pouncing on a target. This will only injure the Survivor and grants them a short window to flee to safety. Striking the same target twice will then knock them unconscious. A player must then carry the unconscious Survivor back to the hive and fasten them to a wall beside an Ovomorph (egg).*\n\n*Both Lethal Strike and Non-Lethal Strike have two standard attack forms:* \n\n* ***CLAW SWIPE*** *- A close-range attack with a quick recharge time.*\n* ***TAIL ATTACK*** *- A mid-range attack with a moderate recharge time.*\n\n*If a player successfully kills or abducts three Survivors, they will begin molting into a* ***Xenomorph Warrior****. The benefits of turning into a Warrior caste is determined by the chosen Xenomorph variant:*\n\n* ***If DRONE*** *→ Any Non-Lethal Strike will immediately render a target unconscious upon the first attempt. The player is also immune to knock-back or stun effects.*\n* ***If RUNNER*** *→ The player will now be able to SPIT ACID as a third, long-range (long recharge time) alternative to Lethal Strike. The player can also sprint and scale walls faster.*\n\n*The Xenomorph movement options consist of walking, crawling, wall scaling, and sprinting. They must hunt the Survivors and can use ventilation shafts, floor gratings, and access panels to traverse maps quicker and sneak up on targets.*\n\n*A Xenomorph player can distinguish all other players in the game by their glowing aura. The color of this aura is determined by whether they are a Human or a Synthetic android. This aims to capture a true insight into how the alien perceives its environment.*\n\n*The Xenomorph can also track Human pheromones. These pheromones act as a breadcrumb trail leading back to the Human Survivor. After a short period of time, these trails will fade from view, and the player will need to relocate the pheromones to continue hunting their target.* \n\n*The Xenomorph is played in Third-Person.*"
hypa4e,Smash bros as an fps,
hyo1mj,Fight your friends.,"Just a thought.\n\nProbably in a magic fantasy setting.\n\nUnlike some RPGs like Final Fantasy where you can resurrect fallen party members, in this game your party members hit zero HP, they're out.\n\nThat's not the mechanic, this is:\n\nYou have to fight every single party member who has died, before or with the final boss as zombies, whom is a lich/necromancer.\n\nMaybe similar to Darkest Dungeon where character death is quite common and replacements funnel in to your village. But maybe there are special storyline characters that you can develop relationships with, then they may die and you'll have to kill them again."
hyirhv,The Final Boss is You,Game idea is simple in thought but most likely much more complex actually creating but I’m thinking of a game with a bunch of bosses sort of like the souls series but the final boss would be you but the game would be recording how you play and mimic that back on you to counter as the perfect boss

hycvsk,A Core fighting game but everyone has a universal command input.,"Something i learn on problems with fighting game and accessibility, and trying to make a accesible fighting game but at the same time i don't want to make a smash clone because making a smash clone that isn'r rivals of aether basically means death for the game anyway, but i want to see in a design atleast could be played on a evo level tourney.\n\nso i wonder if we can make a more traditional street fighter style format be accesible, but also have enough layers that can be played in a tourney level.\n\nand one of the problem i notice is that in a game like tekken or street fighter every character has their own unique command input for all of their moves, and there's like 68 plus moves total for each character, atleast that's what i see in games like doa which does display how many technique a character has and is often around on the 68 mark.\n\nso my pitch is that we can have a street fighter  level variety of characters, from their movepool, design etc, but everyone shares the same exact simple command inputs.\n\nessentially, if you know how  terry bogard controls in smash, you basically know how to contol everyone, so at that point is only matter of which move/character you would like to play more, you may lost those 68 plus moves...but do even competitive players even memories those techniques much less for all character, i doubt even sonic fox would memories his own MK mains entire movepool besides the essentials."

As more people forge for goods locally, the resources begin to dry up. Travel in a pack to unexplored systems to find more supplies safely, or build up your \[defenses/weapons/armor/etc.\], and challenge your skills by traveling solo to distant, but treacherous planets . However, you will soon discover that humans are not the only life form hunting for supplies! Choose an allegiance, scavenge for supplies, build up your \[ships/armor/weapons/resource generators/etc.\], and conquer the galaxy!\n\n*Obviously this doesn't have to be space-themed, but it was the easiest theme to develop*\n\nMy idea comes from a combination of key aspects from numerous other games (I'll try to give game examples with each aspect):\n\n* Trading/Player-Driven Economy (Escape from Tarkov - players set prices on found goods based on supply/demand) \n* Player Specialties like crafting/cooking/forging/alchemy/etc.  (Runescape - a bit of reach but the right idea)\n* Resources that are finite until a planned refresh, so that resources would go from plentiful to scarce based on the duration of the (season?) (No game that I've played recently)\n* Various Locations to gather resources (Astroneer - Travel to different planets/locations to get whatever resource you need, relates to previous point)\n* Passive Aspect (I'm sure there are dozens of these games - You can craft machinery that can gather bits of resources while you're away)\n* PvP, PvE Raiding for resources/goods\n* Clans/Teams/Allegiances (World of Warcraft)"

If you don't know what smt/shin megami tensei/megaten is it's basically a franchise very similar to pokemon because pokemon got some inspiration of this game, it's basically a more adult version of pokemon.\n\nSo, basically, i want to ask if anyone would be willing to program it or take this idea and do something about it, since i myself have no clue of how to program, and make it possible to battle other players with randomly generated demons/persona/etc. like in showdown, so if anyone is willing to see what they can do i'm up for making a dedicated discord server for anyone to help with this idea.\n\nwe would also make the game balanced for both (or more if balanced enough) players, but i know thats asking too much so for now let's try and go with this idea.\n\nif you want to know how the shin megami tensei franchise works, i recommend you play through atleast one of these games: persona 3, persona 4, persona 5, smt 4, smt III nocturne, smt: strange journey.\n\nTL;DR: i want to make a megaten pokemon showdown site but i don't know how to program and don't have the time to make it myself."

hy76ya,Star citizen but ancient rome,"This is how I fall asleep most nights by designing the story for how a game like this could be developed. \n\nIt's an MMO that spans the entire Roman empire plus some territories outside. You start the game as a child of the Roman Empire around 20 bc with parents that are employed by whatever labor their was at the time(farming, trading, soldier yada). You start out as a citizen of the lowest order and develop skills and traits based on what you do and interact with. If your father is a merchant, you can develop merchant skills easier. \n\nAll citizens are forced to spend at least some time in the army and you can make a career out of that and could work your way up in society. Each character ages so the main point of the game is to create a Dynasty of successful generations. \n\nThere is so much more I have thought into this but it's more of a sleep tool for me I suppose. In regards to the title I think if Chris Roberts(the creator of star citizen) was more into history a Roman MMO would be more feasible than an inter galactic space would be."

Actor two: move to mark.  \n3. Actor two: deliver line - ""oh no!"" (hopefully voice recognition is kinda OK nowadays)  \n3. Actor one: shake head and hands vigorously.  \n\n\nFor every action an actor does correctly, they gain points, for every incorrect action, and distractions (laughing, unnecessary movements, etc.) they would lose points.  \n\n\nMeanwhile, the non acting players need to do only one thing - not laugh (perhaps even have - applause, laugh, oooooh, aaaah prompts depending on scene)  \n\n\nContent could be player created if the game would gain enough traction."

hy02ab,Be able to join someone's horror game as the monster,"Hello everyone. This one has been boiling inside my mind for some time. I was watching some horror game gameplays and the enemy's were scary but they stoped being so frightening after you learned their patterns. What could keep it fresh is if a random person could, unknown to the person playing the game, take over the enemy. This would make the enemy character unpredictable. Games where you have to hide would feel like a hide-and-seek with your life in the line rather than the typical ""enter a safe zone"" mechanic that far too many horror games have."

Now, there are 30 or so players and let’s say 10+ spectators, and the spectators can use their points they’ve won in games to help and hurt players like calling in food drops to specific players or making them fluorescent orange for a minute.

hxso7w,"Very long post, please bare with me and my unrealistic ideas.","I've had an idea of a game similar to GTA Online, but as a standalone game. Except, the way I chose to ""map out"" the game was to give it a procedural release window. The game would launch as early access with the base game completed and some other areas (player owned businesses, player &amp; AI gangs/mafias, nightclubs, etc..) available, and eventually free semi annual expansion releases that include new maps, side stories, AI gangs/mafias, and new ""player routes."" The idea is to let the game shape itself essentially, there are storylines in the game people can follow through missions however, there is no actual main story. The AI is also meant to learn off of each other and players, meaning one night some AIs could just blow up a gas station that was owned by a player. The history of the city is the story, looking back years on into the game, you'll be able to see what major events occurred with players &amp; AI. Players can choose to play the game however they want, if they want to rob stores, banks, and whatever, go ahead. If you'd like to make money off of owning multiple businesses, go ahead. The game is essentially a project that releases with enough material to get a fan base going and develops over time, this means players have a lot of stuff to go back to if they created a new character. It also means that players have the freedom to make money however, making it easier to climb the ranks, but also harder at the same time *insert guy tapping his head meme*.\n\nI'm very sorry for the atrocious formatting and my unrealistic idea that probably wasted your time, this isn't even everything, I just listed the things I've thought out the most."
hxppwx,A vr horror game,"So what about a vr horror game that utilises the fact that when you step outside the boundary of the room, at least on oculus software, it shows a black and white live stream of what the cameras see, but what if this could be used for some sort of additional, the game still goes on inside your house kind of thing, it could just be added to something else though.

hxmxls,"Open world rpg with movement ""abilities""","I have had this idea of a game. Its like a first person open world rpg game, like (for example) skyrim, that has movement ""abilities"" like titanfall for example: wall riding, jumping off walls, etc. It could be futuristic but i think it would work being set in the past also. It would have skills like in the elder scrolls series (skills that you can level up). Also it could have ""gadgets"" to have more movement ""opportunities"", like a grappling hook for example. That is just what i have been imagining about. It doesnt have to be taken seriously but i think it would be cool."
hxjaxc,Nicaraguan war,"A couple of decades ago there was a war in Nicaragua from a group of rebels trying to overthrow a corrupt president/dictator. The game could be kind of historically accurate because it is a very interesting story. When the group of rebels (Sandinistas) was able to overthrow the Government, they became even more corrupt than the dictator. There was another group of rebels called Contras who rebelled against Sandinistas, but they didn't succeed. My father fought in this war with the Sandinistas before he knew how horrible they were. He told me stories about how he only ate canned tuna for years. And how he and another soldier were supposed to kill the president, but the other soldier fired a shot before anyone showed up he gave my father tinnitus and the president never showed up in that route because of him. Stories like that are the ones that make a great game. I feel like this would work because it is very action-packed, my uncle died because they were attacking a strategical position and a mortar landed right on top of him. My father told me a story about how they were camping up and out of nowhere they started getting shot at and helicopters threw barrels of oil with fire and burned people. All of these would make a unique and gruesome game. But there were also stories about how there was this hill that he had to run up with all of his equipment on and whoever made it up and back got to eat the best part of a cow they just killed, moments like these are the ones that make the story interesting."

hxesng,I want to see if my dream game is interesting enough,"The title is Bellum (though that isn't finalized). \n\nThe main character is a nomad that's learning magic and swordsmanship (?) in secret. The island he lives on is filled with those who can use magic. Those who can will learn how to and those who don't will learn how to use a sword. There's a hierarchy where those who know magic looks down on those using weapons, thinking it's barbaric. These nomads believes in gods and that they will bestow gifts for when they are in danger. The main character will find a gauntlet that allows him to use magic without components. \n\nEventually an invading army will arrive on the island who are technologically advanced. They come in on airships with suits of armor and guns. The nomads and the invading force goes to war with the nomads losing. That's when the main character goes around liberating the island from the invading army. \n\nThe gameplay will be broken into a hack and slash to a third person shooter. The third person shooter will work with the magic and guns. The main elements that you can use will be earth, wind and fire. Each element can be used to add an elemental effect to your sword and be a passive for the character. For example with earth you can use the ground to turn your sword into a giant hammer to deal massive damage but with slow speed, while the passive will be that the earth will become armor for you. \n\nI would like feedback on if this is an interesting idea and if there are ideas I should add or take away."

i3rg9g,Simple Mobile Game Ideas,"Hi,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am looking for pretty simple mobile game ideas that have an endless sort of theme, please leave suggestions below :D"
i3peco,Game like Hearts of iron 4 (With a twist),So my idea is a game based in WW2 like hearts of iron 4 normally you control a country but invading defending you play as soldiers and your choises affect the soldiers (the soldiers use the guns you bought or made.) You could buy tanks/machine guns to use on the battlefield the game would be more realistic than Call of duty battlefield 1 operations are pretty close i would be happy with that level of realism but theres improovment other things: build trenches build forts/bases for ammunation or other supplies you bought during the game. The game would be mostly single player. Thats mostly it but heres some tiny details features here: You could start a revolution make own custom new flags the game would be in 1st person hearts of iron already has most of details i would want and thats it im done ive had this idea for years.
i3pccu,Unique FPS with a class-based squad system.,"So, I’ve just had a thought. Imagine a player with access to various cameras around the map and the ability to control various map aspects such as doors, disabling/enabling hazards, and the like. Now, underneath that player are two squads of three soldiers each with the same  layout- one has a radio receiver (1), one has a camera (2) and the other has a radio transmitter (3). The overseer player can speak to 1, but not spoken back to. They can only see through 2’s eyes. And they can only be spoken to (or hear audio at all) through/by 3. The two squads are tasked with eliminating the enemy overseer in their base while protecting their own in a round-based format. Each round should take 5 minutes tops with the win conditions being best of 5 rounds.\n\nThoughts? It isn’t very refined because I’ve literally only just come up with it."

Instead of a wagon train to oregon, you’re Odysseus and you lead your ship and crew back home to Ithaca, dealing with mythological obstacles and making sure you have enough food, supplies, and red-toga crewmen to make it home.\n\nIt would both be a fun rogue-like and keep to the educational nature of The Oregon Trail by teaching about Greek History and Myth."
i3knxn,A card collecting RTS game,"You have booster packs with cards that you can build into a deck. These cards include monsters, buildings and spells of different cost and strength.\n\nYou build a deck out of your available cards and play in RTS style scenario's. You can use higher level cards the further you are in the scenario. (by unlocking certain buildings or something)\n\nBy completing scenario's you earn boosters and or currency to buy boosters. If you want you can monetize additional boosters."
i3ke8u,Wariokart,Basically what you'd expect.
i3g6s4,world economy simulation game that starts with current events in real time,"In this game, you would start with the world in its current state - e.g. simplified obviously but still detailed enough to be a true reflection of the current state of the world.\n\n**The setting**\n\nThe 'world state' would consist of:\n\n* Current countries, territories and borders\n* Population numbers and a few other basic demographics for each country\n* Education levels\n* Healthcare system classifications\n* Political system classifications, with Presidents/ Prime Ministers/ Leaders of countries up to date with a personality profile\n* Corruption score which is an approximate estimate based on real data\n* Economic data on the national and international level - i.e. each country's amount of debt/ surplus, borrowing rate, gold reserves etc, as well as large multinational corporations.\n* Stock market system as well - simplified but still as accurate as possible.\n\n**The player**\n\nOnce you start with this 'world state', you are given a choice to 'play' as one of the following:\n\n* President/ leader of X country\n* CEO/ leader of X corporation\n* Stock market broker in X country\n* Political lobbyist in X country\n* Activist in X country\n\n**Gameplay**\n\nDepending on your role and your location, you would have different choices available to you. It could be basically like a turn-based game where you make a decision, see the consequences or other 'moves' of the other roleplayers, and then are presented with the next set of options. Obviously things would get too complicated if the game had to continuously update to match real-world events, but if the start of your game is up-to-date, the rest becomes a simulated alternate reality that changes through randomised events and, of course, your choices.\n\n**Aim**\n\nThe point of the game would be to make choices and try and have the largest impact (positive or negative) on the state of the world, perhaps within a time limit (maybe, your term in office or lifespan). You can then explore the consequences of your choices. \n\nWant to find out what happens if you implemented universal basic income in Sweden? \n\nEver wonder what would happen if the US stock market crashed tomorrow? \n\nWant to stop climate change through protest? \n\nWhat if the President of China suddenly decided to conquer the rest of the world?"
i3euvc,A game where you interact with villagers,"I say villagers because that’s technically what a settlement of less than 2,500 people is called, but really I’m thinking more a small town feel.\n\n#The Basic Idea\n\nThe player would play as some guy who moves into a new town with some money to start him off. You’d be able to pick a place you can afford to live, get a job, maybe decorate/upgrade your house sometimes, but aside from that most of the core gameplay mechanics would lye with the NPC’s in the town.\n\nI want the game to feel like a sandbox where you can do whatever you want, really. You could try to befriend everyone in the town, settle down, have a family, commit a spree of murders, or anything in between. The closest thing I can compare my concept to is the Sims, except I want the player to be able to do more than just live a boring, suburban life.\n\nSome people may be attracted to the idea of a highly interactive free roaming experience, but a lot of people will probably get bored without some goals to work to. For this reason, I think it would be a good idea to have (completely optional) achievements/goals in the game, for each thing you can do. Some things would obviously be easier than others, but some would require some significant gameplay time to achieve. \n\nPerhaps there could be some secret achievements too, so that players don’t accidentally spoil everything the game has to offer simply by looking through the goals.\n\nAs for how many things you can do in the game, I would like to add as many things as I can. Marriage, Crime, Occult, Careers, Friendship, and Funerals are all things I want to add.\n\nSince so much of the game would be just talking to people, I want to make the interactions as fun and interesting as possible. I’d like to include a dialogue system like The Walking Dead’s, and, depending on your responses, you’ll either improve or damage your relationship with a particular NPC. \n\nOf course, if I’m pouring this much effort into the gameplay, I likely won’t have much time for graphical quality. I’m thinking that I’ll likely do fairly simple pixel art for the game.\n\n#My Concerns\n\nMy only issue is with how random I want the game to be, and how strict the consequences of the player’s actions are. \n\nIf I want the game to have any sort of replay-ability, then forcing the player to interact with the same characters every time probably isn’t a good idea. That being said, if I flesh out the exact same cast of characters it is exponentially easier to create more complex interactions and make memorable characters. But again, seeing the same faces every time would have to get boring eventually.\n\nBut the alternative is randomly generating characters, which would undoubtedly make the interactions a lot more shallow and wholly less interesting than I want them to be, especially considering how I’m basing most of the game’s mechanics around interacting with your neighbours.\n\nAnother thing is consequences. Bitlife is a game that showcases exactly how much freedom I want players to have ideally. My only issue is that Bitlife actions don’t really have consequences. You go to the bar, you go home and it’s never relevant again. Well that was kinda pointless, right?\n\nThat being said, the moment I introduce consequences, the game not only gets more complicated, but it takes away freedom. I don’t want everything the player does to feel pointless though, especially considering there is no particular end goal. So consequences are absolutely mandatory— but how many, and how do I apply them?"
i3ekzx,RPG-MMO survival game idea.,"I've been thinking about an MMO game I wanted to make. Sadly since I have absolutely no coding skills nor design skills and I have no clue how to work out an engine I decided to post it here, just curious if it's even a good idea or not. I'll try to keep it as short as possible.\n\nSo this game is about zombies, the story about the virus and everything is something out of context right now, I mostly want to focus on the gameplay:\n\nFor the RPG part I was thinking of having new players select the profession for their survivor, like engineer, medic, soldier, chef, etc.  All survivors have specific advantages, such as medics being able to heal other characters and themselves. A normal survivor would only be able to use bandages and plasters, however medics would be able to admisiter things as adrenaline, stich wounds, etc. The player who wants to get healed would have to pay the medic a certain amount of cash.\n\nEngineers would be able to fix vehicles, repair power stations, etc. Even repair armours or build bases for new players. While also getting paid like any other role.\n\nNow the MMO part:\n\nAll players can trade with each other, as long as they're close in the map, let's say about 15 squares apart. There are also bases filled with NPCs who sell meds, food and everything basic. NPCs will also give missions that might need the cooperation of multiple players; missions like repairing a generator, defending a base, etc.\n\nPlayers would also be able to stablish their own marketplace in each outpost, putting items for sale for other players to buy, or sell them to NPC merchants for a lower price if they don't manage to sell anything. Everyone can even buy from bicycles to travel, cars for travel and storage and even small trucks for maximum looting capacity. \n\nNow the survival part: \n\nZombies, zombies everywhere. There are regular ones which you can easily kill with the first weapons you find, however the deeper you move into the city the more dangerous they get. More resistant to fire, bullets and explosives, they might even have special traits like spitting acid and covering a small area with a deadly puddle. Even bosses which are bigger than regular zombies and hundreds of times more resilient than them, killing them might require cooperation, since some of them could easily outrun and maul a single player alive if they're not careful."
i38p8h,All out War,"New war game\n\nI have a game that I would really like to see come into fruition. The concept is similar to Call of Duty war zone however it has tweaks for more  all out warfare. Basically there are two teams that arrive on two separate sides of an island and it’s essentially a tug of war of who can capture and gain control over the island via securing positions. \n\nThe first part is the boots on the ground combat which I would like to very similar to either Call of Duty or Battlefield, similar customization and combat. \n\nNext is adding many flying vehicles as an option for support or gaining air superiority for strikes against the enemy team. Adding support craft like A-10 or bombers like Su-34 and air superiority or multi role fighters. Including helicopters in there. There would be air fields for the planes and landing zones for helicopters. This is where they can be found. They take off near the edge of the island as too make sure they are not shot out of the sky as soon as they take off and then head for battle.\n\nNext as support would be ground vehicles which could include simple transportation, tanks, gun mounted turrets on them. They would be simple but effective. \n\nLastly a battleship combat element could really seal the deal, with various sizes and strengths and weaknesses, small ships which can really only attack infantry and some light armored vehicles effectively with bigger ships that can take out aircraft, heavy vehicles, but are slow and can’t maneuver well. With large rivers and lakes for small ships to go through to incentivize using them. While larger ships deal with enemies on the outside.\n\nOf course this is a simply the basics of huge game but with further thought, and the added benefit of the next generation right around the corner with large map based games, This type of game would realistically be possible and be one hell of game if there were also other modes, which would make it absolutely massive but could appeal to a very wide audience. The map design and locations of everything could be left to your imagination. What would also be great is having multiple large maps to use so you could have variety in this large mode."
i388bm,Looking for unique villain idea,"Im working on a 3d action platformer, and i cant really think of a good idea for a villain. I want to have a villain with an interesting ideology, because i see a lot of stories where the villain just wants to destroy the world. I kind of need a villain that is bad, but also understandable."

i30gtk,An urban climbing game,"A VR game that allows you go climb construction sights, buildings and even stadiums who doesn't want to climb the Effiel Tower?

It allows the player to freely choose a way to the top but some wrong moves can potentially cause the player's character to fall off and have to climb all over again."
i2z0r1,Looking for stage idea/mechanism for my physics-based casual game,"I have created a game where you control 2 portals and try to redirect a ball towards a point to score using the portals. \n\n(It is a bit hard to explain in words, here is a short game play to illustrate:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xClTq9PpxAg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xClTq9PpxAg)) \n\nI am looking for some insights for new stages.\n\nMy initial design is that the game is an endless-type and there would be a bunch of stages with different mechanics, appearing randomly after getting certain number of points. The goal is that the player could have a different experience every game. However, the game have only around 20 stages now, and as some stage are quite similar, it feels repetitive very soon.\n\nHere are some mechanism that have been implemented for example:\n\n**Points (target):**\n\nDifferent types of points: Point that will bounce the ball away / point that will push the ball towards a particular direction \n\nPoints which moves: Circular motion / Horizontal movement\n\n**Obstacles:**\n\nBlocks that destroy the ball when you hit it / Blocks that simply bounce the ball away / Obstacles that allow the ball to pass through but not the 2 portals\n\n================================================\n\nThanks for reading till the end. Any ideas are welcome!"
i2y8pd,Spider Slap,"First person perspective of the player character lying mostly naked in bed. A giant spider walks into view (as if out of the darkness) and holds itself above your body, straddling the bed. The game begins as clusters of smaller spiders fall off the giant spider (like how wolf spiders carry their young on themselves), landing on your character's skin. The giant one continues to loom over you all the time.\n\nMost of the time, the spiders will land on your lower torso or legs, but occasionally they will land directly on your face, sometimes directly into your field of vision. The spiders' goal is to crawl into the character's mouth. Your goal is to survive as long as you can without letting too many of them get there. \n\nYou do this by slapping the spiders off your body, and also writhing around with your legs and torso. The controls would be awkward (think Surgeon Sim-esque) and very floaty to give it a dream-like (or night paralysis) feel.\n\nBasically this would be a horror style mashup between a Surgeon Sim-esque game and a Tower Defence, with the character's own body being the 'map', letting you have control over the 'terrain' but at the same time instilling a very helpless feeling as you are swarmed by hundreds of spiders, their legs tickling over your bare skin, all trying to overwhelm you and reach your mouth. \n\n\nWould probably work extra well in VR, but it'd be fun even without."

i2ussv,Death and Texas,"One day for no inexplicable reason, entrances to rouge-like dungeons began appearing around Texas; at first people were afraid, but they got over it, Texas ain't full of pussies...&gt;! 'cept Austin, who destroyed the entrances that appeared!&lt;\n\nYou, a bored Texas teen, decide to spend your afternoon going through a dungeon, instead of walking around the local supermarket or park\n\nGame is a Souls-Borne type, mixed with some Binding of Isaac and Enter the Gungeon with a branching class system and randomly generated dungeons\n\nThere is no story beyond the lore of the bosses and other stuff\n\nGameplay is primarily hack &amp; slash, with option to use guns and magic as a playstyle\n\nClasses &amp; perk system\n\nBefore you enter a dungeon you are presented with the ""Nexus"", a crossroads between our reality and the dungeon's own; here you will modify your loadout and perks before dropping in, alongside upgrading your combat capabilities\n\nYou can specialize in various ways of combat, but you can't become a jack-of-all trades, once you're committed to a role, you can't change it until you make a new character...mostly\n\nCombat styles\n\n1 Handed Melees weapons\n\nKnifes, tonfa, small axes, etc.\n\nSpecializing with this increases the speed you attack with and allow you to create branching combos, if you spec into that style, or you can cross into another style\n\n\n\nSmall guns\n\nPistols, SMGs, small shotguns, etc.\n\nSpecializing in this will increase ammo capacity and accuracy with the guns in the category, if you specced into melee you will be allowed to access new exclusive perks and combos if you choose to (also akimbo &amp; gun-kata)\n\n\n\n2 handed melee weapons\n\nSledgehammers, Heavy Axes, Spears, etc.\n\nIncrease damage, piercing/knockdown, damage negation with blocking and open up combos; you can spec into the weapon styles (bladed, blunt, long)\n\n\n\nRifles and Shotguns\n\nSpecing into either gives the upgrades you'd expect from it, range, spread,  accuracy, etc. (Kinda drawing a blank on it)\n\nHeavy/Special weapons\n\nLMGs, oversized axes and swords, bows/crossbows, etc. &gt;!lasers!&lt;\n\nAmmo, attack speed, damage, what else?\n\n\n\nYou can customize your dungeon diver with what you find or purchase\n\n\nOnce a characters has a specialized combat role, they cannot deviate from it at all; they are locked to the set up !you! chose, but you can create a new character any time"

i2rjrb,"Not doing this quite yet, but out of curiosity, would any of you pay for a commission to see your ideas come to be?","I've had this idea for a while, and while I'm not quite prepared yet to go through with it, I'm thinking of doing commissions for videogames, where people come with thier ideas and pay to see them get made. I figure this is a good sub to ask the question, would you pay money for that? I'm not thinking anything too expensive, but also I'm not think games that are too too big. My idea is to make these games within a few weeks, like max two months, and I probably won't charge much more than $20 if it's a particularly big game. So yeah, give me your thoughts about that, and maybe shoot me a DM if you're really interested and I'll tell you when I'm ready to start doing this."
i2jkxr,3D platformer about momentum and movement,"Hi, the game I imagine would be inspired by Spyro (especially Spyro 2) and racing games.\n\nMost platformers are about precise jumps and air control, however due to the camera, no 3D platformer has ever come close to the level of control of a good 2D platformer. Rather than trying to emulate a 2D platformer, Spyro went into more horizontal levels with loose jump timings and a floaty feeling since Spyro glides. \n\nIf you've not played the games let me explain. Spyro has a tiny jump and can't grab ledges but he can glides to cover a lot of ground. Charging doubles the speed of Spyro and makes his jumps longer. There are only 3 jump lengths I believe, 1 when standing still, 1 when walking and 1 when charging.\n\nNow imagine a game more ""physics based"" with many more jumps lengths because your speed would vary a lot more. Like in a racing game, getting to full speed would take quite a while and turns would slow you down, so maintaining full speed through a level would be quite a challenge (whereas it's easy in Spyro). You could add more mechanics like a ""gear"" system, your character would change animation like a horse has different runs according to its speed. You could add some kind of triple jump mechanic where your jumps become longer and higher if you chain them. \n\nYou would dispatch ennemies not with an attack but with your movement, ramming them, gliding just above them to knock them with your feet, charging just past them with blades attached to your sides (like a scythed chariot).\n\nI guess the game would feel a bit like the 3D Sonics but I envision the level design being about more exploration than speed. The game loop would be similar to Spyro 2, 10-15 min to explore a level and then back to a hub with story development every few levels. Your goal would be to reactivate a dormant portal system that used to link far-apart worlds. In every level you'd need to use the entrance portal, find the exit portal to fully integrate the world into the network (I stole that from the Endymion book series). Maybe you'll need some MCGuffin from the world too, the people there would give it if you do some task like defeat the bad guys.\n\nOnce you've finished with all the levels of a hub, you could partake in a race that would go though all the portals, and all the inhabitants would be watching it from the sides. There would also be optional challenges like other smaller races, timed sections, etc...\n\nAs far as controls go I see something like this: left stick to walk, full tilt to run, one button for sprinting that would function similarly to the gas button of a racing game, bumpers for taking sharper turns (with some kind of drift like in kart games), jump and glide button, maybe one to ""change gears"" (I guess 2 so you can slow down?), maybe one to deploy the blades on your sides.\n\nI'm not sure what the protagonist would be, maybe some kind of bird, a flying squirrel would also fit nicely (and they're cute).\n\nNothing revolutionary but a feel-good, fluid platformer with a more challenging side if you want to get into it."
i2bmdc,An idea where you control gravity to finish a puzzle,Let your imagination lead you ...
i2aniz,A 2d platformer game with a good concept.. I think,"I had a decent plot idea for a game, and wanted some comments and criticism regarding it. \n\nSo technically its a 2d platformer styled game, where the MC is a normal student that one day finds a girl that becomes the love of his life, but one day he and his girlfriend are transported into another world. \n\nThe world has different stages and, the MC's memory is a bit blurry and now he finds himself having to save the girl by climbing up the world while facing different trials each stage and collecting memory shards to remember the time he and his GF spent. Only to find out later that his GF was from that world the entire time and she was transported back by her mother and father. \n\nThe game will have many characters that help him on the way and different game mechanics like that of hollow night and ori. I didn't really write in complete detail but that's the concept"
i2ahut,Blacksmith game idea,"Almost every blacksmith game start at a expected placelike a town, in a kingdom or at the side of the road. Fuck that. Start anywhere, Rimworld style. Start at the desert? Good luck finding ore and shit but you could make a lot of glass with a shit ton of sand. Set up on a mountain? Lot of places for ore and a lot of places of danger but not a lot of customers unless you consider untrustworthy kobolds and man eating dragons customers. Want to be start in the forest instead? Good for staves, spears and the like. The locals are very friendly assuming they dont kill you, eat your flesh and wear your skin a lioncloth.\n\nYour blacksmith start as a novice making basic weapons and tools but as you get experience you can modify weapons like adding a spike on the blade near the tip, at the middle of it, near the guard or all three. Modifying weapons either increases or decreases certain things such as its weight, its reach, its durabilty, its attractiveness and its value(but you can lie to your customers of its value).\n\nAfter making weapons that look like it could pass as the Excalibur or abominations that look like it could kill the enemy and yourself, you will want to have your creations enchanted, so you hire aspiring enchanters for cheap, then fire them for incompetence as they enchanted the weapon to be on fire when the customers requested it to imbued with fire to the blade. Go to a competent enchanter to enchant the weapon, then kill the enchanter bec enchanting is fucking expensive, then get arrested. Learn to enchant instead, accidently enchant a weapon to poison the wielder, sell it anyway. Follow that customer who bought the poison enchanted weapon, watch them die, loot them, dispose the body, sell the weapon again. Profit\n\nRegret selling a weapon with good stats? Hire a thief to steal it for you or steal yourself. Alternatively you can hire an assasin or you know... kill them your self.\n\nI want a blacksmith game with a lot more freedom than just make weapon and sell weapon."
i28xt6,Ideas for a FPS game,"This is just a list of ideas for my dream game :)\n\nSo you know how many modern military has cameras on they’re helmets?

i26vpu,"""In Darkness Dwells"" | Competitive Game Idea","So I came up with this pretty baller idea for a video game last night.\nI called it ""In Darkness Dwells"". Essentially, it's like a competitive game (online or otherwise), where you go into matches, and one person plays a human Slayer, while the others play one of the many available monster types (Vampire, Lycanthrope, Zombie, etc). And it's basically a free-for-all in a stage like a city or a forest or something.\nYou can upgrade your main monster class and your Slayer by playing them frequently.\n\nAt the start of a normal match, there is an Investigation stage for the Slayer/ Terror stage for the Monsters. During these first 3 minutes of the match, the players are in single player.\nThe Slayer plays during the previous day (in game), collecting preset clues, which will allow them to learn what Monster types they're up against. Then, they also can look a bit deeper and learn what specific abilities the players of these monsters have equipped, which will allow them to equip tools to directly counter them.\nDuring the Terror phase, the monsters choose their abilities and cause chaos against NPC civilians, gaining extra buffs for the upcoming match depending on how much of their specific monster's task they complete.\nThen, a minute of loading the level (or readying up) allows the Slayer to choose their equipment, then into the free-for-all.\nOf course, there would be other game modes, but this is the base.\n\nThe way I'm kinda picturing it, the game would play very similarly to something like the most recent God of War mixed with the fluidity of Uncharted."
i22cnl,"I was talking about a pokemon pet care app with someone and he said he actually programmed one once for just his gf but doesn't think he will publish it bc he would get sued since well, copyright obviously. So I replied this:","I've been thinking about this (even though I can't program but I'd either like to learn when I have time, or pay someone to make an app for me), and I think a nice legal way for this to work would be to have a completely non pokemon tamagotchi game, BUT with a huge focus on breeding as well as trading pets - there should be a few different ""basic"" body types, but based on how you treat them (diet, activities etc.) they evolve with different minor changes of their basic body types. Like let's say a meat based diet will have the head and torso shape change into one thing in the next evolution while a plant based diet would change it into another thing. I imagine this less like x changes into a or b, but rather it changes a tiny bit on a scale similarly to the creature creator in spore where u make stuff thicker or thiner or longer or shorter and add a bit of this or that extra part and make that bigger or smaller... So basically you evolve your pet as it grows up, and when you get to breed it, its offspring will be a combination of its parents last evolution stage. It would be like people are actually designing their own creatures, except it's by evolving and breeding them. SO and that way, if there only were enough possibilities for the creatures to change, people could actually build pets that resemble pokemon. And now the other aspect that I'd love to be included - trade - You get to offer the genes of your creature publically for sale, so people could create let's say something resembling bulbasaur, and others could adopt bulbasaurs! Man I could write a multiple pages long concept for a game that this instant, I keep having flashes of ideas\n\nQuestion, would something like this actually be possible in form of a mobile app? I still really want it to exist (have dreamt about a similar thing already ages ago) and would like to work on it together with anyone who is interested in working on it, once I have the money, time and skill"

i1zsq7,A foolhardy beaver searching for wood in Antarctica,A platformer where you build wooden contraptions to scale platforms. The player character is a cartoon beaver that scavenges wood from research bases in Antarctica. You build machines like in Besiege or World of Contraptions.
i1y4ob,Tactical MMORPG,"Imagine a playing a tactical rpg set in a sci-fi, war torn setting where you pick a side from multiple factions, fight for control of battle fronts, and your enemy and allies could be other players or even npcs. There aren't too many tactical MMOs, only one I can think of is dofus. While I love dofus I think the genre could have been done better in a different setting and with different mechanics all together.\n\nTactical rpgs with more of a focus on shooting, losing your opponents, and using cover would add so much more to the strategy of the game. Melee attacks could still be a thing but it would be more of a high risk high reward type of thing. Melee attacks could do really high damage but you would take a lot of damage if you try to just go charging in. You would need to use cover and hide your movements to get in close to get kills.\n\nTheir would be a max about of units that can enter any encounter (20v20) people can enter a fight at any time as long as no more than 20 units haven't joined in yet. It wouldn't be turn based per say either. All players would decide the actions of their characters beforehand sndcall actions would play out simultaneously, so predicting your opponents actions would be the key to winning. \n\nFor example, your enemy is behind cover. You have the option to shoot at them, throw a use a item or ability that ignores cover, or try to reposition yourself. You decide to shoot but they try behind cover and don't take any action to expose themselves, then you basically wasted that action because it's a guarantee miss in that case. If you use a ability like a grenade or something and they decide to move, then it will miss. If you try to reposition out of cover and they desire to shoot from cover you will take damage. There's no do to answer and predicting your opponents moves and synergising your characters actions would be key to winning.\n\nFor classes, there is no set class for your main character. There are certain kits you can run with abilities and perks to certain weapons but you aren't locked to a class throughout the game. You level kits by using them unlocking more abilities and perks to swap out. \n\nThe characters that you recruit to your squad do have set classes, perks and abilities that they unlock by leveling up. So recruiting would be a constant thing throughout the game so you can get the exact party members you want. You so have to keep in mind though that when party member fall in combat they can't just get right back into the fight. There are downtimes for them if they die.\n\nIt will be a PvEvP game but it would be new player friendly with the first few zones being PvE focused to allow players to learn the game and level their characters. The progression not throwing too many much at you at once. When you first start out you cant even gain squad members and will have time to learn about your own abilities and progression but when you level up to a certain point you gain ranks which unlocks more features of the game. You won't have to go though the story to level and unlock these features but it would be recommended for new players since the questing would teach you about these systems.\n\nFirst is the squad feature, being able to recruit and add squadmates. Then getting your own platoon, with the ability to send your own npc squads out to help out on battlefields. Eventually they teach you about gathering resources to craft things like gear, bases, and even war machines that I'll go over later.\n\nFirst I'll go over recruiting. You can recruit members in a numerous amount of ways. One is to just go to one of the bases (npc or player made) and pay the currency hire them into your squad. Another way is to find Npcs in distress on the battlefield and helping them. Finally when you beat a enemy there's a chance that one of the Npcs could be spared to let them join your team. That way even ally and enemy party members can be recruited to help newer players fill out there squads with characters that other players have used or at least kept in their group.\n\nWhen you unlock the platoon feature your can send out your team in squads of their own to fight one any of the battlefield. They can level and gain you resources amd money the as long as they on alive on the battlefield you place them in. They will even help to capture battlefield on PvP battlefronts if left unchecked. But just like if they die in your own squad there is a down timer for them and will only be sent back out once all their down timers are up again.\n\nFinally are they resources which can be used to make and upgrade weapons and other pieces of gear. Improving things like accuracy, damage, crit chance, even increases and amount of hits per attack, the number of attacks before requiring to reload, and downtime for reloading. That's just for the weapons themselves but armor you wear also have stats like movement speed (how far you can move move per round).\n\nThese are also player made bases that as I said before can be a hub to recruit party members. But are also places to upgrade gear, as respawn points, and places to deploy war machines. Player made bases can be raided and destroyed. Either by entering them and destroying a core inside the base and getting out before it blows. Or war machines could also destroying them without having to go inside. The base counds as 4 units in a fight.\n\nLastly are the war machines which act as world bosses. They count as 8 units in a fight. Each faction can only have one warmachine on the field at a time. To make one you need a ton on resources and it takes a lot of time to make. As its being made the maker can set the priorities for it. IE enemy bases, control points, or other war machines. Once the timer is up the war machines reeks havoc across the battlefield on a straight course to its top priority that exist at the time. Enemy players can try to stop it and ally players can help keep with up. Once a fight is over and the machine stands there's a cool down before anyone else can attack it again.\n\nAt the end of the day it's a game to grow your platoon and use it in the PvEvP battle grounds to help your side claim the most territory. Benifits for holding territory could be more resource, money, and exp gain but it would all be to drive the focus of playing with other players against other players in a massive war like setting with battles constantly going on around you."
i1wkrx,"""update"" on school sim zombie game :3","After some thinking, I made some changes to the ""game"" idea... because it's all over the place. There's too many things going on and it feels like you would be playing 2 games at once if it ever came out. So... Instead of playing as characters, beating the game, then going back to make your own and replay the game as a sandbox... oof... it will now just be like this: There are 5 characters you play as. You start as 1, meet the other 4 as the game goes on, and can switch between them at any time. That's the TLDR. Below is a more defined plot:\n\nThe 5 characters (C1, C2, C3, C4, and C5) are ""forcibly"" made to attend a strange school. Once there, they discover the school is actually a secret military experiment that teaches its students to defend their nation - by training them to be soldiers. But their country starts to get attacked by zombies... so, they start training the students to fight them. The game's goal is to have all the zombies defeated and finding out the truth on why they even attacked to begin with. So with this idea, the school and military is a lot more involved with their zombie issue.\n\nC1 and C2 are related, and their parents are rich. They send them off to the school thinking it's a great boarding academy, and will help them get into a good college. But once they find out it's a military experiment, they can't un-enroll them. They're freshmen.\n\nC3 is an orphan living in the city the school is in. She's a first grader. The foster home sends all of their kids to the school because of their illusive reputation and thinks it will help the kids feel more grounded. The military finds out C3 actually has magical powers, so they want to keep her enrolled to study her and use her as a weapon to fight the zombies. The foster home refuses at first, but decide its in her best interests. All the other orphans are NPCs and do their own thing.\n\nC4 and C5 are also related, are orphans, and also have magical powers. Since they consider themselves to ""have nothing to lose,"" they willingly enroll themselves at the school, eager to help fight the zombies. They're pretty much the only outsiders that know the school is a secret military experiment. Everyone else who enrolls finds out the hard way.\n\nWith all this established though, the relationship the school and military have shouldn't be negative. It shouldn't feel like the military is taking advantage of the kids. In fact, the kids become fully aware of their situation and willingly want to help. And the whole country is aware of the zombie attacks, so that puts more trust in the military to take care of them.\n\nSo after enrolling, the characters become friends and form a team of ""magical super-heroes"" ready to fight. Some other students have magical powers too, and are there because they are considered to be useful to the military. Some students are geniuses and can build weapons to fight them, so in the game, you'll have to negotiate with them to get those weapons to fight, and later upgrade them as the game goes. Some are just beefed out and super strong, so you need them on your side when first starting off to fight.\n\nYou can still do things like customize the main characters' appearance, join sports and clubs to boost skills, etc. Your inventory system will be your backpack and locker now, instead of like, 8 different places. You can switch between the 5 characters at any time to boost their stats, fight, gain skills, etc. because some levels require only certain characters and/or their powers. Some students have their own agenda and may need some negotiating to work with. They're not NPCs, I have them written out, but I think it will make the game more challenging for a character to be a bully at first, and you have to befriend her to find more info about the zombies and military.\n\nAll of the characters are in different grades which will unlock certain parts of the school, certain cutscenes, and make the game more challenging. For example, C3 is in 1st grade and is not allowed in the high school building or the dorms. So if she ever needs to sneak in to meet C1 or C2, who are high schoolers, she must do so via the air ducts. High schoolers get a lot more information about the zombies and military, middle schoolers get more booksmarts training, and elementary kids are more ""studied"". So C3 has to deal with a lot of things like: avoiding teachers, sneaking around, and relaying information.\n\nBut yeah! I think this feels a lot more organized now. What do you guys think? I'm still working on ""plot holes"" like: Wouldn't the students eventually tell their parents, *""Hey the school you put me in is training me to be a zombie fighting soldier!""* and how some students have magical powers and everyone is OK with that."
i1wenu,(Trapper idea),"Ok this is just a rough idea, so your a cowboy that has to hunt Cyptids across a wild west setting,\n\nSo it would be like Mega man/ Shovel knight a with a 32 bit style\n\nHere are the 15 bosses: TX Chupacabra, WI Wendigo, AK Tizheruk, CA Dark watchers, WV Mothman, KS Sinkhole Sam, ME Specter Moose, MS Pascagoula river aliens, NJ Jersey Devil, NM Teratorn, SC Lizard men, WY Jackalope, OH Lovland frogmen, CO Slide rock bolter, And finally WA Bigfoot\n\nThe weapons I've thought of are double barrel shotgun, a sixshooter, and a bear trap that pull's monsters to you and can be used as a grappling hook.\n\nThat's all thank you for reading!"
