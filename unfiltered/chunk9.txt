iuqk1p,Need help fleshing out game ideas,"I've been throwing around different concepts of the same underlying idea of a multiplayer voting game, but I don't think any of them would stick. I'm hoping I can get advice about which one to stick with, which to merge, etc.\n\nThings that are constant:\n\n1. odd player count\n2. 2 party system (might increase later)\n3. a pool of cards with positive and negative traits\n4. After the candidates are selected, they are both given two pos/neg traits. Their goal is to, within a minute and a half, convince everyone to vote for them despite whatever the opposing side might have.  During this time the voters can change between any side, unless there is an unanimous vote. After time is up, the person with the most votes and their supporters win.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nVariant 1:\n\nThey can see each others traits, but the voters cannot. This is easier to create fallacies to win the voters over.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nVariant 2:\n\nThe voters can see the traits. This forces the candidates to to work with they have to come out on top.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nVariant 3:\n\nInstead of being given a set trait, they can select four from a random hand of eight cards. This creates a bit of luck if you get a good card, but if balanced correctly could be an interesting mode."

iul1nk,a game that combines all the best aspects of spore and niche: a genetics survival game,"it would have something similar to [the genetics system from niche](https://niche.fandom.com/wiki/Genes) as well as the turn based strategy aspect, but it would have something similar to the stages from spore.\n\nit would start out in creature stage, but the stages would be much less clear cut. like, you would start advancing beyond creature stage when you get a creature with high enough intelligence (witch would be randomized but higher on average depending on how advanced you are, peaking at tribal stage and remaining the same through the rest of the game) and you have enough rescourses, you could have said creature craft a simple tool or weapon. progression into the other stages would work very similarly.\n\nim not sure how i would handle space stage though, im open to suggestions.\n\nsomething i would specifically add to the niche genetics system are vitiligo and leucism.\n\nunlike in spore, your creatures would continue evolving and maintain the same genetics system throughout the game instead of ceasing to evolve at tribal stage."

iuj24g,Serial Killer Simulator,"Hi i have idea for great Serial Killer Simulator i am JoJo fan so i woul say it would be something like Kira Yoshikage Simulator but forget that so idea is :  \n\nI don't mean a game where you can be a rampage killer like GTA but one that is focused on the serial killing element. So basically, you could be a trucker (it is an occupation that is thought to be ideal for serial killers according to the FBI) and you could free roam about and rampage kill but another option could be you abduct a individual, maybe sedate them or something and if you're seen someone might alert the cops, if the cops are alerted then you have to blend in while people could see wanted posters and then full on chasing by the law could occur. How you dispose of the corpse (Richard Kuklinski Ice Van style or such), matters as if seen or the corpse is discovered the cops would be onto you.\n\nSo, basically like GTA but more intelligent if you know what I mean? You could choose to rampage kill but the element of slowly killing victim after victim while a state of panic sets into the country could occur.\n\nIf caught you could be interrogated and depending on how you perform you could then be arrested and sent to prison where you could attempt escape or something like that.\n\nWould you play such a game where the emphasis could be on serial killing (in a free roam environment rather than Manhunt)\n\nThat is the idea i would really love if someone maked this idea real."
iuh8xf,Enemy driven MMO(just an idea),"one thing i always hated about mmo's is the fat that t BBEG is defeated by every player that at the end of the story becomes the ""hero that saved us all"". what i was thinking is somethin g more like an actual d&amp;d campain.  \nthis is just an example of how it could be a game such as this:  \nThe evil lich lord  scourged the lands of ""FictionalWorldLand"" for 200 years, and his undead armies took away every city aside for a last city protected by a barrier created as a last resort. The players have to ""claim back"" the lands bit by bit, destroing fortesses contreolled by powerfull undead liutenant and rebuilding npc communities that will produce actual resources to sustain the surivors. this imply that the usefull npcs that populate the gameworld can actually die, the npc outpost reformed by the players can be lost once more and the undead fortresses can be retaken by the lich lord. the ultimate objective of the game would be (obviously) to kill the Lich Lord and the last sacks of undead servants that might try to bring him back to life.   \nA game such as this would imply a dual existence of the lich lord: one as an actual npc to be fought, and one as an AI tha basically plays an RTS against all the players, managing his own resources (i.e. corpses) to further his objective of total annihilation of life.  \nIt goes without saying that a game like this would need an actually good combat AI. What i mena with this is that combat AI of enemies are specifically designed so that players can exploit their blatant weaknesses (think of the cheesing in dark souls) while a game like this that would ""technically"" end with the defeat of the Lich lord would need to be a real challange: enemies should have good combat ai, should use tactics to sourround enemies, should exploit the players weaknesses, and actuate strategies like ""divide and conquer"". Stealth sections should be actually hard and reward careful thinking by the players and not stupidly high ""stealth stats"" like in skyrim where given enough sneak you could literally crouch in front of the yarl and 6 people around you would not detect you.  \n\n\nSo after all this wall of texts i would like to pose two questions:  \n1) would you like a game like this  \n2)there are of course several problems with a concept like this that i may not realize, what are some of them according to you (aside from the obviously difficulty of making a game of this scale)?"
iufcrn,Needs help for idea: Kaiju: Kings vs Servants,"So I have an idea for a shooter. There are two teams, 5 servants and 1 king. Think attack on Titan.

iuei0h,Evolution simulator,"I highly doubt this is even remotely possible but think about it for a minute, imagine it's like universe sandbox, you control only a few things about the planet like the density of the atmosphere, the gravity and so on. Based on what you make creatures would evolve for example planets with huge atmospheres would be home to tons of flying creatures, stronger gravity would make creatures with stronger legs, asteroids and ice ages could be used to cause mass extinctions leaving the smallest creatures left to evolve and start over, you wouldn't actually customise the creatures but the environment they live in would affect this."
iub1kr,Game where you play as a dolphin with powers üê¨,"Had an idea inspired partly by the Ecco the Dolphin games I played as a kid and partly because I just think dolphins and underwater areas are cool. I have some rough ideas for the setting, characters, plot, and environments, but I don't want to get too carried away so I'll just list some general thoughts. If you've played the 3D Ecco The Dolphin game (from 20 years ago wow I feel old), this will be a bit similar.\n\nI'm thinking of a 3D environment maybe with some 2.5d sections, either semi-realistic or a charming stylized aesthetic. I think it would need decent fluid physics with waves, currents, and such, but not that extreme.\n\n**Character Abilities**\n- Movement: Swim, charge, spin, and maneuver through water with grace. The same controls can be used to leap from the water, twist in the air, and also do a tail-walking trick as a fun addition. As you progress, you may learn new moves, go faster, and jump higher.\n\n- ""Singing"": AKA sonar / echolocation / magic powers. Send a sonar burst in a targeted direction at button press, or hold then release to emit it in all directions as a sphere. When sonar contacts surfaces / objects, it will highlight them then gradually fade, most useful for navigating in dark or murky areas. It can also be used to call to / speak with other creatures, interact with the environment, and perform special actions with later upgrades. Could also be used in some music / tone related puzzles or minigames. You could learn ""songs"" or acquire gear to use your sonar as a sonic weapon and tool to hurt / confuse enemies, destroy / manipulate obstacles, heat / freeze things, telepathically carry / move objects, command fish to follow you (glowfish as light, pufferfish to ward off enemies)...or other fun mechanics that work with the game's environment and creatures.\n\n- Misc. Catch and eat fish, which can have different effects. Have an air / stamina bar to manage. You can also unlock new powers / gear to enhance your abilities as you progress.\n\n**Setting, Environment, Design**\nYou adventure through a world with fantasy and some sci-fi elements. The gameplay includes solving puzzles, navigating mazes, platforming, and combatting enemies, often with cleverness and agility rather than brute force. Obstacles and enemies are designed to test your unique abilities and limits. \n\nExplore the open ocean, coral reefs, secluded caverns, tropical rivers, arctic seas, abyssal depths, and even the skies. Perhaps even a realm beyond among stars and spirits. Discover natural wonders, ancient shrines, brilliant underwater cities, industrial labyrinths, floating water skyways, sunken spacecrafts...Find both allies and enemies among other sea creatures and even some land dwellers along the way.\n\nI kind of want the world to have a somewhat similar vibe to games like the Jak and Legend of Zelda series, as well with some darker almost horror / dystopian elements in parts of the game. I was also thinking of mixing in elements of myth like legends of Atlantis and Polynesian folklore.\n\nAnyway, these are just some ideas I came up with while bored... Definitely a bit all over the place as I tend to get lost imagining all the possibilities haha. Of course, the more features you add, the harder it is to develop and synergize them all. I only have very amateur skills in terms of coding and art, even less in 3D modeling and animation / rigging (aka I've watched some YouTube videos), so I don't see myself as capable of making something like this. I personally just want more games with underwater settings and felt like sharing. Thanks for reading, and if you have any thoughts / feedback feel free to comment."

iu9ddi,A very meta silly slapstick variety/sports/relay game.,"Free ideas!\n\nSoo I'm not entirely sure whether this has been suggested before, but I saw it on reality TV and thought it would be a cool video game. But it's so silly that I figure it must have been thought of before...\n\nSo, it's basically a point and click God game where you direct a team of people pretending to be units in a video game. On the TV shows, they are actual people, but yeah, they're just NPC's in this game...\n\nYou are the (un)lucky person on your team who calls out orders to your fellow teammates, and they follow game rules and frantically try to carry out your orders to win the game.\n\nHilariousness ensues as they run around the field, pushing, shoving, insulting, slamming into each other, tripping over each other, falling into water traps, wacking each other with their cardboard cutout signs, wearing poorly designed costumes, cheating, and sometimes breaking form to take revenge on other players.\n\nThe trick (for the developer) is to set up obstacle courses and relay races and mini sports matches and tests of skill in order to get the player (real) to accidentally command team members to do things that have these hilarious results. The problem is that I hate reality TV so I don't have many ideas for how to do this in that sort of style.\n\nI remember seeing people play something like lawn chess, where the players are chess pieces, and they'd bump into each other and fall over and there was a lot of opportunity for funny chaos to break out. Also lots of cringe and other drama that could carry on across multiple rounds of games, etc.\n\nThere was also one where the team members were blindfolded, and they had to go through an obstacle course guided by a teammate's commands...\n\nThere was one where some had to do challenging tasks. If they succeeded, an opponent would have something humiliating happen. If they failed, a friendly teammate would have something happen, like pie in the face, or slime, or getting dunked in a dunk tank, or having to eat something gross, or whatever.\n\nOne was a war game where they had very exaggerated protective gear, and big clubs to hit each other with, and some team members were poor losers and would retaliate if attacked and it would turn into a brawl. I think one of the tropes was that someone held up a sign displaying the unit's health bar, and they kept getting in the way or getting confused.\n\nPart of the silliness is that the sports games were parodies, with teammates being the ball and bat and net and whatever other things you use in a particular sport. They would either wear clumsy costumes, or they would hold up signs with a drawing showing what they are. Making it into a video game could allow for even more dramatic stunts. Idk, maybe there are already games like this, though..."

itmd6s,A game full of quests set in an expanding village.,"The game starts in a 2D pixel-based art style. You are a normal resident in a small village. The mayor is an old man who gives you some quests to help out the residents. The more quests you complete, the more your village expands. Over time( say 5 playtime hours) your now City is a metropolis with so many buildings to explore and so many attractions to see. \n\nThroughout this, you expand your own home. Not much is added just some furniture and what not. Once you finish all the quests, the mayor gives you a plaque to put on your wall for helping him grow the city.\n\nThe credits roll.\n\nEagle-eyed gamers may spot some weird inaccuracies. Why is there a voice actor section for a game with no dialogue?\n\nYou are left with a ""go back"" button and a ""restart"" button. The ""go back"" button doesnt work. \n\nYou click ""restart"" and hear voiced dialogue.\n\n""Kiddo, what have you done?""\n\nThe screen zooms out to show it was just a game in a 3D world. You see your game city, but now all 3D, and a meteor crashing down to ""restart"" the city.\n\nNow you play in a 3D world that is much more darker than before. Your quests now are to help people cope with the sudden disaster. Other quests relate to your old choices. A couple you hooked up now want to divorce after an affair. etc.\n\nSome residents break the fourth wall. Why didnt you click ""go back"" and was the 2D plaque in a fake world worth it?\n\nYour goal now is to find parts to fix your 2D game. To go back to your simple fun little world. But you have to survive through the apocalypse caused by you clicking ""restart"".\n\n\nThat was my idea. It was more detailed than what you guys mightve wanted, and definitely falls more towards being just a fun thought. If i did have to change things to be more ""creatable"" the 3D parts could instead be replaced with slightly more detailed sprite art. Though that would diminish the shock value of the transition."
itm0fg,How to make exploiting not the best strategy,"\nIn my last post I shared my idea of a leveling system, where cards give you XP,\nwhich let the player level up for amazing rewards and gam changing  effects and asked for reward ideas.\n\nLast post: https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedesign/comments/ipafgz/what_makes_leveling_up_exciting_in_a_card_game/\nTLDR at the bottom\n\nAfter reading and trying out different ideas on pen &amp; paper it occured to me that\ngoing with a level-up would work a lot better with one of the best Hearthstone \nsingle player content: Dungeon Run.\n\nFor those who don't know, Dungeon Run is a mode where you build a powerful deck\nas you fight harder and harder AI players. Your goal is to defeat 8 bosses without\nlosing.\n\nI loved this mode because it let you do overpowered or even game breaking stuff. \nAnd everyone loves doing overpowered stuff in card games, unfortunately when there is \none player on the other side of the field or in my case an imaginary player base. \nThen you have to always limit yourself with making overpowered cards/synergies and mechanics. Thus I can make leveling up feel more exciting and not worry about a frustrated players at the receiving end.\n\nImmediately I started thinking of integrating my proposed level system into\nDungeon run but quickly I found a way to abuse this by players not killing the Boss\nand instead grinding them out for maximum XP.\n\nSo there should be some way to discourage this behaviour, ideally by making it a\nmediocre strategy at best to follow. \nThis could be done by losing XP if the game goes on to long, although \nI don't like the idea of taking something from the player.\n\n\nTL;DR; I decided that making a single player card game is much more fun to me \nthan a multiplayer one. But I need help to discourage player from \nexploiting the Level-up system."
itl9be,Looking for Partner/Group for Unity Project,I want to create a game but my problem is that I can‚Äôt come up with a good idea or have the skills for a big project.

j10sau,Why this is not created?,"There are a lot gamers who loves hunting games, a lot of gamers who loves survival games and a lot more who loves battle royale. Why not make a game out of it? \n\nGame like Vigor, where you can exit map any given time. Low poly but realistic mechanism like in Firewatch(map, compass). A game where you can to craft fire camp, manage your hunger like in Green Hell and Don‚Äôt Starve. There should be a game that combine theses. \n\nClosest I have come to is Hunt: Showdown. But you are not hunting animals, you don‚Äôt have to watch your meter, you hardly craft and you can hardly win when you are not skilled. \n\nTo make the game more interesting, there should be battle passes with which animals you should protect and which animal you should kill. Currency gain in game could be use to customize shelter(decorations, pets), appearance, weapon skins, buy foods. \n\nLet me know your thoughts on this."
j109ik,Bird simulator/ objective game,"Game similar to ‚ÄúUntitled Goose Game‚Äù were you have to fly around to complete tasks. Like Copoka, you can learn about the place you go by listening to people and watching advertisements.\nExample \nObjectives: poop on billboard, newspaper, moving cars, people and etc. Steal bread, coins, rings, twigs and etc. \nMaps: garden, building(including interior), roads(including power lines, sidewalks), farm and etc\nMovement: mostly manual like need to click to flap wings.\nI know there is ‚Äúpigeon simulator‚Äù but I feel like this is a different take."
j0zfru,Star Wars RPG that I think would be the ‚Äúultimate‚Äù Star Wars game,"\nNow, of course there are tons of Star Wars game ideas out there, but I felt like I had to share my concept of it.\n\nSeveral of my ideas have been heavily influenced by other games i‚Äôve played, which will be mentioned along with the original idea and how i believe it could be implemented.\n\n‚Ä¢A Jedi‚Äôs Full Path and Conflict‚Ä¢\n\nSo, I believe the game should follow the story and development of a youngling, later a jedi padawan (the classic star wars story), see them becoming a knight, fighting for the order, eventually becoming a member of the council, training future jedi, getting a padawan assigned to them. The entire arc of a jedi.\n\nI will not give too much specificity and thus restriction to the story itself, but i believe it could revolve around the inner conflict of having been taken from their family as a child and realizing, that becoming a jedi was never actually a decision, eventually having that decision featured in the game (maybe the ending) of whether to stay with the order or leave it to live a life of their own.\n\n‚Ä¢Multiple Dialogue Options‚Ä¢\n\nThe storytelling would be in the style of how the story of the Mass Effect trilogy was told, almost always featuring custom dialogue options and decisions, with some having story-changing significance, but most of them simply having the (in my opinion crucial) role of developing and customizing your player‚Äôs character and personality. \n\n‚Ä¢Character Customization‚Ä¢\n\nAnd with that convenient segue, I believe the game should feature a fully customizable character including height, weight, garments, and as the gem that Jedi: Fallen Order gave us, lightsaber customization (which would be a prominent element of the story when our character reaches the age when they can make their own lightsaber). All of these are very important in my opinion for getting the full experience and personalization of the story...and are also really cool.\n\n‚Ä¢Limited Open-World‚Ä¢\n\nSomething that both Jedi: Fallen Order and Mass Effect did really well is choosing the right balance of limited levels to open world. When you‚Äôre in a mission, you want to be focused on that, but you‚Äôd also like to walk around and interact with the world while out of missions. Full open world (like the one SWTOR uses) in my experience could make the story too drawn out.\n\n‚Ä¢Customizable Fighting Animations‚Ä¢\n\nSo, the idea would look something like a mixture of Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy‚Äôs and Jedi: Fallen Order‚Äôs fighting mechanics, and the animation selection of NBA 2k, where you can select which animation your character should use for each certain action (such as dribble moves, layups, jump shots, dunks, so basically there are several options for every movement a player might make). The way this could be implemented for lightsaber (or even force) combat is that there would be a certain number of different animations for one specific move. For each contoller command that would mean a specific kind of move, you could choose to equip a more elegant or agressive or acrobatic animation, or maybe even ones differentiated by which lightsaber form that move belongs to.\n\n‚Ä¢Developing Force Usage Style as a Padawan‚Ä¢\n\nDuring certain stages of learning, they would make decisions which force power to focus on. For example, in ‚Äúclass‚Äù, you‚Äôd have the option to either delve deeper into learning the jedi mind trick or to push and pull larger objects or so. Later on this same mechanic could mean that as a teenager they could decide to further their understanding of the force or focus on lightsaber combat. This would function as an ‚Äúinvisible‚Äù skill tree where your development of your powers happens during and in the story.\n\n‚Ä¢Staged in the Era of a Flourishing Republic‚Ä¢\n\nThe game would have to be set in the time of either the prequels republic (maybe before the clone wars) or the rise of the new republic as it would be set in the time of a stable jedi order, which has either Yoda or Luke as the grandmaster. This would be important since the game would focus on the internal, personal conflict of a jedi, rather than the absolution of galactic chaos and war.\n\n‚Ä¢Summary (TL;DR)‚Ä¢\n\nTo summarize, it would be a game with personalized combat mechanics and fully customizable character creation, about the (to an extent) choice-based story of a Jedi‚Äôs life, its development, the responsibility, the struggle, and the realization that whatever a person may be born into, the decision of what to live in is inevitable and fundamental to every person‚Äôs life.\n\nThank you for reading all the way through if you did and i‚Äôd be very glad to hear any input or addition or expansion that you may have on it."

j0pvjx,A litteral God game,"I've always thought it would be cool to play a philosophical game where you are God, and you rule over the entire earth complete with animals, natural disasters, disease, evolution, and billions of people.\n\nBruce Almighty - style where you can manipulate ""anything"". You can see what anyone is thinking about or doing at any time (sims style) and you can choose to smite them, or pin them to be destined for hell, or heaven.\n\n\nThe main point of my idea is to be philosophical, in the Bruce Almighty, Bender from futurama is God style.\n\n\nObviously it would be unplayable trying to manage 8 billion people so it'd probably have to be a scaled-down fictional world if something like that were made.\n\n\nI know there's lots of games where you play ""as"" God but my idea let's the npcs directly (individually or collectively) worship, try to communicate with and impress or respect you, or defy you... Based on rules which the AI is guessing"
j0oq0g,"A turnbase RPG with cool down but also a thing i like to call ""heat up""","2 simple mechanic, rather than have a limited MP, every spell has a timer that varies depend on the spell, obviously the more powerful the longer the cooltime period, but it can be shorterned with the right equipment\n\nHeat up is basically the damage mechanic from earthbound, a move where a critical insta kill is not the end, the hp move will gradually scale down like a timer, even an insta kill, meaning you have a fraction of time to save yourself from a mortal damage or go for broke and hope your powerful magic can cool down fast enough and hopefully kill the enemy before you do.\n\nso basically it create this risk vs reward for time management, can you beat the game without using single potion? do want to use only level 1 magic and play it safe? you could, do you want to use only level 3 magic without a single potion heal? you can."
j0o16f,Something to make a MMO RPG unique?,"Now says it feels like MMORPGs are all the same skeleton with a different coat of paint. Sure, they have some different mechanics but the gameplay loop, combat, loot system etc. stays the same. So, my question: what would you do if you were making a MMORPG to make it different to the overused skeletons?"
j0nvya,"A 2D post apocalyptic survival game, that‚Äôs similar to Cormac McCarthy‚Äôs The Road in tone and feel.","I know post Apocalyptic games get done an awful lot, but I thought having a post apocalyptic game that was just ‚ÄúWow, Badlands are so crazy‚Äù could give a bit more room for freshness.\n\nMechanically speaking you‚Äôd be playing as a scavenger, trying to hide from groups of cannibals and other unsavoury individuals simply because it‚Äôs impossible to grow food any longer. You‚Äôd be looking for discarded cans of tinned food, bottles of water, clothing to keep warm, fuel for fires etc.\n\nThere would be some combat in the game, you may search a home and find a pistol with a few bullets, but this would be very rare. And melee combat would be difficult against individuals and downright impossible against larger groups. \n\nStory wise I can‚Äôt think of one at the moment, I was thinking about you being a father trying to get his son from point A to be Point B, but felt that would go from inspiration to straight up ripping off The Road and Escort missions are very difficult to do well. But the cause for the apocalypse would be that a meteor has hit the earth and as a result caused a nuclear winter, it‚Äôs pretty much the case that humanity is f‚Äôd and people are just trying to survive for as long as possible by any means necessary at this point.\n\nThere would be a simple crafting system, but this would only be for things like repairing patches in clothes so you can feel a bit warmer or at the absolute most crazies maybe having a baseball bat have some nails in it‚Äôs for a bit more melee damage.\n\nYou can rescue survivors from cannibal camps who‚Äôve been captured or even just meet other people like you along the road who are also just trying to survive, you‚Äôd have the choice of how to approach these people, they may offer to take you back to their camp themselves and lead you into a trap, or they could be just regular good Samaritans who want to help out a fellow traveller, you‚Äôd need to figure this out for yourself with a text based dialogue system.\n\nWhat does everyone think? If you think it‚Äôs a good idea but needs some development feel free to throw in some of your own ideas below or if you think some things don‚Äôt work and/or could be improved upon, I‚Äôd be happy to hear. üôÇ"

j0h8d4,A game (MMO or single/multiplayer) that combines the ability management mechanics of something like wow or Diablo with the movement and aim mechanics of an arena FPS,"So something similar to doom eternal except instead of having so many guns you might have X amount of spells/abilities instead depending on the class. One player might quickswitch between multiple slow firing weapons to DPS while another might use less weapons and more utility spells and cooldowns.\n\nBosses drop weapons and new spells with varying stats and effects. Even mobility moves like dash are lootable, with players being able to find grappling hooks, rocket boosters, spring boots, etc etc.\n\nGame also incorporates heavy platforming elements and environmental traps into the combat.\n\nOpen-world dungeon area as well as matchmaking for instances, raids, and PvP."
j0di38,Ranged DMC style game weapon/combat style?,"Hi me and a friend are making a dmc style of action game but the twist is ranged combat only for the player while enemies can be melee or ranged. Kinda shmup inspired where all enemies attack in patterns. \n\nThe only ""problem"" is that I am stuck on what kind of ways the player attacks we don't want guns like Lady (DMC) but can't pick between firing from hands or using weapons like staffs, books or maybe swords like Vergil. So I wanna ask you guys what would be cool to see/play with? Other mechanic ideas are cool to hear aswell.\n\nThanks :D"
j0bqcf,Anyone know cool tricks to make top-down gameplay feel better?,"Hey, I've been working on a top-down game that's centered around action and resource management. You can only move by dashing, and the dash is on a long cool down and refreshes on kills. You have a standard small melee attack, but you can pick up power-ups that grant limited use weaponry.\n\nMy issue is that the gameplay feels very boring. I've tried adding screen shake and pauses on kills, polishing the dash animations, etc, but it just doesn't feel very fun to play. Does anyone know of any tricks that can be applied to make the gameplay feel a bit more fun?\n\n(Also, does anyone know any methods to handle the animations properly? I was thinking of separating the legs and the upper body so I can handle walking and aiming separately, but it seems like a whole lot of work)"
j0aps7,"just a plain, good old, Car Simulator. Just drive around EU or NA and have fun.","Much like Truck Simulator, except its cars. Maybe make a more ""Gamey"" side of the game where you're a Taxi or delivery company or something. But like, it's just you driving, looking at the sights and having fun. Maybe you get better cars by either people paying you, or the amount of range you cover is used as currency.\n\nI see this as a very therapeutic game to pick up after a stressful week. And plus, I love cars, so like having just a cool chill game where you just drive em around with no care in the world about the emissions, crashes or anything else you put yourself in is just so much fun to me. This isn't like a Forza horizon game though. As I said, it's way more on the truck simulator vibes."
j09rra,Noclipping as a game mechanic,Thinking of how to use no-clipping as a game mechanic. Something along the lines of maybe a battle royale or speedrunning esque game where you use the no-clipping to gain a temporary field/speed advantage with randomly generated maps.
j07wbn,Using real-world steps as in-game currency or steps in a battle royale game,"Imagine Fortnite or COD Warzone, but you have to move around in the real world to accumulate points that you spend moving around in the game. It would be used for anything, really. For example, instead of mining resources in a Starcraft-style RTS game, you‚Äôd have to go run or walk a few kilometers. Maybe there could be a pace element to it, like a multiplier for getting X number of steps in Y minutes gets you 2X in-game movement points. \n\nIt would be tracked through a smartphone companion app that could be synched with fitness tracker apps or other step counters."
j07gsq,Play as Tony Hawk and Tony the Hawk,"As seen [here](https://imgur.com/7EwKFWx) I'd love a game where you help Tony Hawk find his lost hawk named Tony. You should be able to play as Tony and do various tricks and objectives to eventually find Tony the hawk. Occasionally, you should also be able to play as Tony the hawk and fly around and poop on people's heads and other stupid things like that."
j05rzq,A game based one the Cube movies.,"You start out inside of the cube with a group of randomly picked characters that all have their own personalities and some useful items on them. Your goal is to find the exit of the cube before your own character dies. \n\nStarting out you don't really know the characters or what useful items they have on them, but depending on what dialog options you pick they will reveal more about themselves and help you to find the exit.\n\nGameplay would look like this: \n\n- You wake up in one of the rooms at the center of the cube.\n\n- You explore the first room and talk to the characters. Depending on what personality your own character has you will now have build a basic relationship with them.\n\n- All of you decide on which room to pick and which items to use. \n\n- Depending on the trap in the next room and which item you used you all know have to decide who will enter the room first. It is possible that a fight will break out between you, but that also depends on the personalities of the characters. I also think that a sanity meter would make a lot of sense here.\n\n- The steps repeat until you die or reach the exit.\n\nOn your way through the rooms you may find items or new characters that will join/attack you.\n\nThe fun part is that every cube, group of characters and items are randomly generated."
j01rtt,Brainstorming Game Ideas to Try and Make in Unity,Hello! I'm pretty new to mobile based game design but I want to build my portfolio and maybe make some semi successful games along the way to earn some money. What kind of games have you all been craving? Are there any games you'd like to see on the market?
izu3dt,Mid apocalypse video game.,"This sounds weird with just the headline, but hear me out. A game set in a large open world city experiencing the middle of a outbreak of a unknown zombie pathogen, a branch of rabies that has much more exaggerated effects of normal rabies, extreme hair and nail growth, for scratching, something like that, all the sort. But not set AFTER the world has fallen. Zombies would be your last worry, you'd be more scared of people turning corrupt in the name of their own survival, raiders, looters, scavengers, thieves. And you're just stuck in the middle of it. The city would look like, y'know the George Lloyd protests? like that. City on fire, with huge groups of riot police and people who are trying to hurt even kill officers to get their guns before the apocalypse. Everyone KNOWS that this outbreak is going to go out of hand, so even the most pure are killing and looting for survival. But things like electricity and such still work. Like a normal glowing light city skyline. But as you truly enter the city its a mass of chaos and murder. With the back alleyways holding loot but also the infected. Large supermarkets that are destroyed and empty. But still holding small goods you could grab. You would need to think of your own morality too. Similar to games like lets say, dying light, your weapons would break, you'd run low on food and such. But it wouldn't just be for health. You'd need to maintain hunger. So you need to decide on, things like ""Break into this apartment and kill the owners and be rewarded with loot for weeks? But trade off the chance of certain people who are selling things not selling to you"", like a morality system. Although this would probably be hard to make, I can always dream."
izrtys,Lost in the woods,"I just thought of an idea that I want feedback on, you‚Äôre a kid and you go out into the woods and get lost, but instead of finding your way out, you decide to just live out there and at first your survival skills are very basic but as time goes on, you become better at surviving and building more advanced things. The stuff you build stays as rather primitive stuff though and doesn‚Äôt get too advanced."

izmqqm,Magic,"I played this game when I was little, and I want to find it again. It was about a wizard going from a castle to defeat an evil witch. I played it on an Amazon Tablet using Amazon Underground. There were different elements, pets, and staffs. There were many traps and enemies. I also remember there being different cloaks, like a double cloak and I think there was a bath robe. There was a online play too. I think there were three worlds with levels in them. I think the main character was sassy and never showed their face. The game was played in 3rd person, the art was ""cartoonish"". You would walk to the right killing enemies and avoiding traps.\n\nSpoilers \n\nSTORY:The king sends you off on an adventure to save the kingdom (I think). You meet a witch she helps you but then you fight. You crash down into the under world,the witch turns into something that looks like the moon lord from Terraria. At the end you fight the witch using all the elements, but after the witch is defeated she says that she was trying to lure all the monsters into the under world to save everyone.\n\nDoes anyone know what this game is? Please tell me if you do. I could answer questions but I think I already put down all I remember."

izk3fx,Setting your own objectives,"One thing I always hated about sandbox games is that, despite them being big open worlds, you're still guided somewhat ""on-rails"" with regards to objectives, even if there's a lot of them. One idea I have is for a mechanic that involves players setting their own objectives to accomplish an end goal.\n\nOne possibility:\nA military management game that has you playing not as the boots on the ground, but the CIA handler who directs special forces and guerilla allies in their efforts to overthrow the local government. For example: throughout their patrols and recon missions that you set, they'll pick up intel such as time/location of convoys, HVTs, supply caches, and so on. You are tasked with determining which intel to act on in order to achieve the end goal of taking down the military and government infrastructure in place.\n\nAny input? Suggestions? Games that use a similar system?"
izh58r,Directions to take a rocket-building game besides the realistic one of Kerbal Space Program or SimpleRockets?,"My favorite elements of Kerbal Space Program are the gravity turns (you don't just fly straight upward to get to space), building a cylindrical spacecraft with modular parts, staging, and the realistic depiction of zero gravity. \n\nAll of these are super-rare in sci-fi, where spaceships move like fighter planes in air.\n\nI'd like to make a prototype of a less realistic, more arcadey rocket builder. Inspired by KSP, it would have key realistic traits like atmospheric drag, staging, inertia, and gravity. Everything else would be either cartoony or rule of cool, but the spaceship experience would already be more realistic than most games and movies.\n\nIndeed, the rocket-builder could be only a small portion of the game. But I'm not sure what direction this could be taken, if it isn't a realistic simulation. \n\nI was thinking a PS1 style horror, drifting between space stations for resources, as one possibility. \n\nA surreal platformer as another where the command module is a personified robot character, use your rocket to stage between the platforms, switch between customized lower stage loadouts."
izh0us,My Dream game that is probably over ambitious and way out of my skills sets and probably need a game studio to make.,"Hey all this is my first post here and I wanted to share my idea of my ultimate open world game that can be played with or without people (best if you play alone)\n\nThe idea's:\n\n- Open Wold\n- - the world will evolve as you play\n- what you do in the game could effect the game world\n- - Fully explorable\n- all structures will have interiors\n- - all construction sites will be explorable\n- all abandoned structures will be explorable\n- - fully destructible environments\n- emergency units will respond to your actions\n- - random events will happen \n- emergency units will respond to the random events\n- - natural disasters will happen\n- man made disasters will happen\n- - the black market\n- stock markets\n- - economy\n- terrorist groups\n- - weapons\n- military\n- - aircraft\n- seacraft\n- - vehicles\n- building/structures will evolve as you play\n- - you can go to jail\n- you can brake out of jail\n- - new technology will appear and evolve the world\n- you can build new technology/buildings/vehicles/ect\n- realistic building damage/destruction\n\nExamples of some of the idea's:\n\nEx 1:\n\n- if you explode a store the store will stay exploded until you or the NPCs will deal with it so if you don't  repair or destroy it yourself the NPCs will repair/destroy the building them self, the fire/police/medic departments will come and investigate the incident and will lunch investigations into why it happened and you can get caught if your not careful enough.\n\nEx 2:\n\n- Construction sites will pop up and will build over time and you can even build your own structures (or just burn them down of you want).\n\nEx 3:\n\n- as time goes on in game new technology will appear and buildings and more will change to fit with time.\n\n\n\nSo this is my dream game, feel free to add/change/give ideas to me, and thank you for reading it!"

iyzawp,Russian roulette (w a twist),"I had a game idea for a Russian roulette game where you would have 2 lobbys. A gamblers den and a players den. The basic idea is the gambler gets to pick a player (the player can decline) and then the player plays Russian roulette. The gambler would put the money (so like gambler pays 150k and player would get 50k per player and gamble get 100k per player) \nThe twist, is the gambler would have 3 choices he can decide (once per game) \nDoubleUp - the player would shoot twice\nSkip - skips this round\nOr Respin - respin the gun.\nI got pretty far into this idea before i realized how much making games costs so if you want here more you can pm me."

iyrevt,Ideas for non-realistic games that could use Kerbal Space Program's rocket-building mechanics,"Particularly the staging, building a long vehicle in modular pieces, and the physics-based movement. It need not be a rocket, though, and the physics don't have to have real world values.\n\nBesiege and Space Engineers are closest, but they are cubic rather than radial."
iyr575,Ideas for a fantasy-themed rocket-builder inspired (very loosely) by Kerbal Space Program and SimpleRockets,"Some ridiculous ideas to start\n\n* Victorian steampunk rockets with clock towers, air balloons, steam engines, whale oil, etc. Oceanography terms and stylistic features. Engines much overpowered how they would be.\n\n* Medieval/Renaissance space program based on Da Vinci's inventions, Joseon Dynasty Hwacha/rocket artillery, and clockpunk tropes. Geocentric solar system with a firmament you can land on.\n\n* Biological rockets that hunt other rockets for food. Think Spore Aquatic stage but you build a rocket instead of an organism, with mouths, sensory organs, of varying uncanny valley. It would be surreal, almost Vangers level.\n\nHow would any of these fantasy ideas still be inspired by a more realistic simulator you ask. Well it still has staging, making it a unique kind of flight, and also the radial component based nature, not quite the same as Besiege for example."
iypjp3,The next Ghost Recon open-world game should be a prequel that takes place in occupied France in the spring and summer of 1944,"In Ghost Recon: Wildlands, a small team of highly-trained operators is inserted into an area of operations that has been occupied by an overwhelmingly brutal enemy. In a region tortured by its presence, dedicated but beleaguered guerrillas oppose this enemy, using whatever is at hand to thwart the enemy and restore the freedom and dignity of their country. The operators‚Äô mission is to link up with and support the guerrillas, to liaise with them and help coordinate efforts between the guerrillas and the operators‚Äô own country, to assist the guerrillas in combat operations, and conduct their own direct actions, as well.\n\nThis scenario could also describe Operation Jedburgh, in which multinational teams infiltrated Nazi-occupied France to liaise with and assist the French Resistance.\n\nUbisoft is perfectly positioned to produce a game that would be a sort-of prequel to Ghost Recon: Wildlands that is based on the world-saving exploits of the French Resistance and the Allies who assisted them, the Jedburgh teams and other SOE and OSS operatives, badasses like Nancy Wake. As a French company, Ubisoft seems uniquely positioned to tell this story. The company has already done an awesome job with GRW, making it at the same time both immersive and accessible to casual gamers. They even managed to slip some educational content into GRW, as well, like entries on religious syncretism in Latin America.\n\nThe prequel would be set in the spring and summer of 1944, and unlike GRW would take place in only a portion of France. It would begin with the player having just parachuted into France with their teammates. They are initially tasked with linking up with a local resistance cell and an Allied agent who‚Äôd been operating in France since the beginning of the occupation. Overall, their mission is to work towards the liberation of France and support Operation Overlord. The main antagonist would be a particularly influential commander of an SS tank unit that poses a threat to the Allied forces if he is able to deploy to the beachhead in Normandy‚Äîthe player‚Äôs team must keep him tied down in their area of operations. The main antagonist‚Äôs influence in the area is such that he essentially controls all German military and collaborating French personnel, there; he even wields influence over the local Gestapo operation.\n\nThe player and their AI teammates have multiple overarching objectives, similar to dismantling the smuggling, production, influence, and security operations of GRW‚Äôs Santa Blanca cartel. The team will have to disrupt supply and logistics by sabotaging railroads, cutting telephone wires, making roads and bridges impassable, destroying supply depots, etc. The team will destroy military targets of opportunity like grounded airplanes, docked ships and u-boats, tanks caught refueling, etc. The team will undermine the local security apparatus by identifying and terminating collaborators, Gestapo agents, and SS officers. After years of occupation, the local population are yearning for liberation that seems just beyond the horizon. Those not already active in the Resistance will need an extra push, though, so the player and team will have to undertake missions to inspire the populace into active measures. Civilians will have to be protected from reprisals. There will be rescue missions: captured Allied spies will need to be rescued from detention before they are transported to impenetrable prisons; downed Allied airmen will have to be located and retrieved to safety. The team will have to recover airdrops to help supply the Resistance.\n\nThe game would take place in only a part of France. Transportation in France in the 1940s was not like transportation in GRW‚Äôs Bolivia in 2019, so the geographic area could necessarily be smaller in scope. Also, given the premise of the game, it would not make sense to have the map include areas that had already been liberated after June 6, 1944. Finally, it would be a disservice to Paris to strip it down to try to squeeze it into the game, as much of the action would take place in villages and the countryside. Also, Paris was not a place a Jedburgh-like team would have operated until shortly before it was liberated.\n\nIn terms of game mechanics, there could still be squad orders and sync shots, but orders would have to be given while the characters are in close proximity to each other, because they wouldn‚Äôt have personal radio sets. For example, the player character would have to give a ‚Äúrally on me‚Äù hand signal and have their teammates come to him before whispering sync-shot targets to them. Because part of the premise of the game is to tie down German forces to prevent them from being deployed elsewhere, there‚Äôd be a reward for the amount of time spent with an Unidad Patrol-type ‚Äúalert‚Äù in effect, assuming the player has the alert dismissed after breaking contact and a period of successful evasion; the greater the alert, the greater the reward. The gunsmith wouldn‚Äôt be as big a part of the game, but there could still be a healthy diversity of weapons, as the team would have to be proficient in whatever is airdropped as well as any weapon that they find or capture. Clothing would affect detection by enemies and assistance from friendly NPCs: operating in uniform rallies more friendly NPCs and makes them a more effective and cohesive fighting force (i.e. it toggles ‚Äúsmarter‚Äù AI/different AI behaviors), while operating out of uniform allows the player to conceal smaller weapons to approach enemies without being detected as a threat or triggering an alarm status before opening fire (this would only work with pistols and certain submachine guns, and limit the number of explosives carried).\n\nThere were resistance activities all over Europe that could provide inspiration for this game. For more information on people and events that could inspire this game, looking up any of the following on Wikipedia is a starting point:\n\nOperation Jedburgh\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Jedburgh\n\nOperation Carpetbagger (Insertion and resupply of Jedburgh teams and Resistance) \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Carpetbagger\n\nFrench Resistance in 1944\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Resistance#1944:_The_height_of_the_Resistance\n\nNancy Wake (SOE operative)\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Wake#Wartime_service_and_Special_Operations_Executive\n\nOperation Ratweek\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Ratweek\n\nOperation Heads\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Heads\n\nOh, and DLC could introduce a skiing mechanic for a campaign that evokes the raid on the heavy water factory in Norway.\n\nMaybe there could also be a DLC campaign for linking up with Allied forces after D-Day, during Operation Cobra, where civilian clothing exposes you to friendly fire."
iyoqd0,"Among us, but you don't know if there's even one imposter. (Plus other ideas)","I've been playing among us a lot lately and it's given me a couple ideas. Main idea, what if you had some kind of mode (or even a whole nother game) where there may not even be an imposter? You would probably have to rework the tasks to be dangerous so you could still lose, and so that it's not immediately obvious there's no imposter. I think it would be interesting because you wouldn't even know that ejecting people does anything. \n\nAnd since I'm talking about among us ideas, one thing I've noticed is that in the game people will often trade thier lives for the greater good of the team ""if you eject me and I'm not the imposter eject X"" sort of thing, so it got me thinking, what if we gave individual crew mates to value thier lives? What if, instead of one round, and the game is done, it was several, and if you win *and* are alive you get a point. And then after all the rounds are done the person with the most points win. This would also make it so having the odds somewhat stacked against imposters would make sense, if an imposter does win they get a huge advantage."
iyh1ee,A survival game with a destructive twist,"Now, I am no game developer, and I honestly don't expect anyone to expand on this idea, but I've had it for quite a while and I want to see what you guys think.\n\nSo, it would take place in a city on an island which may or may not be procedurally generated. Now, the idea is that noone lives in this city anymore, except you and maybe your friends. Your goal is to survive by scavenging for recourses. Simple, right? Well, here's the twist: every day, a natural disaster will occur which damages the city. Hurricanes, acid rain, earthquakes, etc. Now, these events would damage not only the buildings of this city, but even sometimes the island itself, shrinking the playing field over time. The main goal of the game would be to survive as long as possible by eating, drinking, and making it through daily disasters."

Hunters can visit people and they learn who visited their target, as well as who did their target visit. They can kill too, but if they kill a civilian they die too. The Cult has different members, such as the assassin who doesn't appear as a visitor of the hunter's target, or the bomber who attacks everyone who visits his target as well, blah blah blah. Hunters don't have members, they are just hunters. There is no voting also."
iy6j5k,"There is a lack of well-made medieval RPG games. I am working on one now, do you have any ideas that you want realized?","Hello! I love games set in medieval ages with simple but intriguing mechanics, particularly with nice dialogues. From time to time, I get an urge to play such games but it is really hard to find one. I think there is a serious lack of this type of game. Mount and Blade and Kingdom Come Deliverance are very good examples here but I do not find any other like these. I am leaving out the fantasy genre (including the Elder Scrolls series, which is great btw) as I am looking for a bit more realism.\n\nDrawing from this, I started working on a hobby project to develop a 2D top-down medieval RPG, where you will play as a knight who lost his memory and trying to gather who he was and what he is to do. I want this game to be simple but yet with a lot of variety (with dialogues, quests, mechanics etc.). I know this is hard to achieve but it is going well so far.\n\nDoes anyone agree with me? Do you have ideas for a medieval game / mechanic which you would love to play?"

His objective is to spread the fart cloud and make it as big as possible through some yet-to-be decided mechanics.\n\nThe other players have to do missions to help contain the spreading fart cloud before it grows into a global pandemic and can't be contained any longer. Each round the players get to vote on who they suspect the farter to be.\n\nThe player with the most votes (farter or not) will be shot into the sun.\n\nIf the fart evolves into a global pandemic, the farter wins. If it can be contained, the other players win."
iy5cgy,Die Hard Battle Royale/Towering Inferno like Storm,"So Die Hard provides a great platform for Battle Royale.\n\n\-Set the game in a single huge high rise building.\n\n\-Start the game barefoot, shoes can be rare pick up. Walking on broken glass hurts, leaves blood trail/have to bandage mechanic.\n\n\-Elevators/Elevator Shafts. Can use either, climb up and down cables. Grab on to underneath of elevator, end up on top of. \n\n\-Pick up walkie talkies, randomy voice chat with enemies anywhere in building who also found walkie. \n\n\-Fire hose/ropes used as outside of building rapelling.\n\n\-Crawl through air vents. \n\n\-Your last name is McClane but your wife goes by Gennero. \n\nNow, Die Hard is just to get the idea going. Doesn't even have to be licensed. I just like the tower and broken glass mechanic.\n\n\-Use the idea of a burning skyscraper to replace the storm/circle. Could have a light/heavy storm. An inner part of the fire where its constant damage/insta death like other storms, and an outer part where some parts of the floor/furniture are on fire while others not, allowing for traversal and combat."
iy4a14,"PROJECT: UTOPIA, a real life like inmersive game where you work online to maintain a civilization by logging into game DAILY to complete task like farm, work, hobbies and more issues needed to maintain ,empower and make the entire Community/Civilization rise to the ranks UTOPIA from a slum city.","The way envision the game could  be played online on our cell phones and use GEO location that would lock us to our city. Example, if I live in the state of Florida then I would mandatory must join FLORIDA and cant join Ohio or I cant join California Community.....where the person lives in real life is the states VIRTUAL CITY that a person must join and collective try to be the best city in the game....actually working together with people within the same city you actually live .The game would look like SID MEIERS CIVILIZATION from an aerial view of the buildings like houses, farms, factories , hobbies and your personal TILE in the game would all look like a traditional Sid's Game.....now...when a Player clicks on a particular building the you can enter example the Movie theater and then the graphics will now look like a traditional SIMS game with high detail and advanced graphics of buildings and avatars to customize.  \n\nThe key to the game is having a promotion campaign tgat spreads through  the USA because since its a GEO location based SIM building game then if we launch a 500 players download game in California then if they play they will get a quick advantage on example if only 50 players download from Florida.  Because remember the state that a real life player lives is the state they are locked into when they log into game it automatically drops the player into their states virtual city. So at first example....the open invitation can be a RESERVATION of 50 people PER state download the game in order for the game to start in the USA then at least 50 people from ALLLL 50 states must download the game. Basically when the 50th person from the 50th states fully downloads the game then immediately the game will start and states unlocked. Now its open for entire Google App to download for free. The more people within your state in real life playing game and collecting items the more powerful your state will be against the other 49 states in the virtual game. \n\nThere can be a MONTHLY battle/race features  integrated where example the best player or a Vote sends 1 player from all 50 states to compete and try to bring the rewards back to their virtual state. \n\nCan anyone suggest cool things for this game of mine ? I will someday create a GoFundMe and bring this game to life."
iy3h6u,A VR game where your blind man. Hear me out,"A VR game where your a blind man who needs to go through your everyday tasks, similar to Octodad but instead of being an octopus you cant see\n\nThe way it works is you can only see the outline of your hands and when they get near something the area around your hand will reveal itself to simulate touch.\n\n I feel like the mechanics could be expanded upon a lot (especially what you do as your goals) but thats the main idea. I dont know if its good or not as i never made a game before but I thought someone might find it interesting and expand upon and twist the idea into something fun"
iy1t8l,A VR Game About Operating Bizarre Guns,"Reloading in VR can be a lot of fun, this game would run with this mechanic and take it in a strange and hopefully fun direction. There would a few dozen very unique guns which each reload and fire in highly unusual ways.\n\nOne gun might be a toaster gun which fire flaming toast at enemies. You reload by putting bread in the end, pulling the slide down till it locks and it fires when the toast is ready. If it jams you need to pull out the power plug on the gun and get a fork inside it to remove the bread.\n\nAnother gun might be a clockwork gun which needs winding up vigerously for 10 seconds before use.\n\nAnother might be a ""math blaster"" where you need to answer math questions on a touch screen each time to make it shoot with a difficulty slider which also changes how powerful the gun is.\n\nAnother gun might be more like a traditional rifle  but with an needlessly complicated mechanism."

But at some point Guillelmo del toro said F\*\*k it and decided that giant mechs where stupidly heavy and that they should stay on the ground punching the hell out of skyscraper-sized monsters... and that's awesome. \n\nThink about a VR game that let you play as the pilot of a jager with you being inside the head of the mech that becomes completely transparent and lets you see the rest of the body, tha giant kaiju trying to rip off said head and the wonderful neon lights of tokyo surrounding you.  \nit could even have an hipothetical multyplayer co-op where the two players have to coordinate in order to get the most out of the mech unless it recieves conflicting signals."

ixyiah,Enemy Guards and the Elementals,"For context: Top down 2D Stealth Action Game\n\nEnemy Guards want to live as badly as you do. If they find a good looking weapon, they will equip it and leave their old weapon. So don't drop your fucking rocket launcher it's empty, alright? Good.\n\nIn addition, enemy guards can run out of ammo, just like you. They do not have infinite ammo in their ass. No. They will go to a weapon room and re-fill their ammo there. They can also go to the weapon room if their weapon was stolen while they were asleep.\n\nI should mention that it should be possible for weapon rooms to be destroyed with explosives. I know I can easily implement weapon rooms being destroyed by explosives, but a idea from you on what should happen if they are all destroyed would be very much appreciated.\n\nIf a corpse is discovered by a guard, said guard will stand in front of it and call a slave to carry the corpse to a emergency room.\n\nSaid slave will be a earth elemental. It will carry the corpse away and ""revive"" it.\n\n(If the corpse belonged to a guard, turn the corpse into a guard with a random patrol path)\n\nThe earth elementals are really friendly, big tree people. They only get aggressive when they see a fire. When aggresive, they will attack everyone. Including you.\n\nThere are also other elemental slaves. Water Elementals can be called when a fire has been spotted. Water Elementals always come with a escort made up out of two guards because they are more defiant than Earth Elementals. They will only attack the player while there is a guard near them. When there is no guard nearby, Water Elementals will immediately attempt to flee.\n\nI think there should also be an interaction if a earth elemental and water elemental meet...\n\nOh and of course they wouldn't be limited to only appear when a guard spots a corpse or finds fire. They will also appear in the level itself, being bossed around by those darn enemy guards.\n\nOh and one more thing:\n\nIf a enemy guard is injured (less than half of their HP, poisoned or bleeding), they will go to the emergency room themselves and get healed there.\n\nWhat do ya think? Sound good? Sound fun? Got a suggestion? What should the interaction be for water and ""earth"" (or maybe I should call them forest) - elementals? What other elementals should I consider adding?"
ixtn6m,"When is the amount of keybinds ""too much""?","Creating a game at the moment similar to one step from eden, but instead of the abilities being 9 chosen abilities that cycle through randomly, I'm working on a tag battle version (similar to UMVC3/DBFZ?). \n\nIn my game I would have each character hold on to 3 abilities (max 3 characters) and you would hit a button that would cycle through each character in a defined order. My question is that, is this too much for a player to handle? My game is not very casual player oriented in the harder levels but I also want it to be an accessible title. \n\nIn One Step from Eden they use a system where the player can use 2 abilities at a time that are consumed and cycles to another random ability, which seems to be pretty casual friendly. Should I reduce the amount of abilities a character can have to 2 and find some other way to compensate for the loss of the ability (perhaps a passive effect)?"
ixia7u,Multi-Genre RPG (Might actually work on this if I ever have time),"I was jotting down some ideas today for different game things to try playing with since I've started messing with some game engines again. \n\nOne idea I came up with is a multi-genre RPG. Basically, you run around the map like a normal RPG (2D style for the engines I'm currently working with) and when you encounter various enemies/NPCs you complete challenges/battles with them in different ways depending on the creature/NPC. \n\nOne challenger may need to be defeated by a puzzle game (a slimmed down match three for instance), another might be a standard 2D sideview RPG battle, a third might be a version of a bullet hell where you have to grab your specials or attacks to fire back, and yet a fourth might be a jumping platformer battle. \n\nWould this me too much shoved into one game or does it sound interesting? I know that Undertale uses a scaled down bullethell kind of ""battle"" system though it isn't really battles from what I understand. \n\nA variation on this idea was to have the RPG world as a platformer and then picking locks or disarming traps would be a match 3 puzzler (with bonus power ups if you have a rogue in the party), while hitting a creature in the platformer opens up a RPG battle system. There could then be another ""mystical challenge"" triggered by something else that is more like a rythm game. \n\nThoughts? Concerns? Koalas?"

If a enemy picks a grenade that has been thrown and is about to explode back up... what should happen?\n\n1. Enemy keeps on holding grenade. I think this would make the player feel superior.\n\n2. Enemy throws grenade. Might be the more chaotic option.\n\n3. Enemy starts running in random directions before the grenade explodes.\n\nOn another note, I also added explosive barrels.

You do tricks by inputting certain commands into your controller and you can get air by either jumping off of the ground or vaulting on top of cars and trucks. The curling stone loses momentum over time, however, and may even break if too much is destroyed by blunt force. You get points for doing tricks and destroying as much as you can, and those points can be spent on upgrades. These permanent upgrades will do one of three things. The first upgrade will make you start out faster, the second will polish the stone so it loses less momentum, and the third one will make it more durable so it will break slower and resist certain other things that will insta-kill you (explosions, shrapnel, gunfire, etc).\n\nPart 2) Gameplay\n\nYou can jump off of car doors and jump off of car roofs. Jumping off of car doors will break the door but will send you in the opposite direction. You can grab onto certain car parts that are still attached to the main vehicle and you can jump from car to car. If you jump off of a car, its roof will cave in and the passengers will be exposed. You can either hop to the ground at the cost of your durability, jump to a new car at the cost of speed, or squish the passengers at the cost of momentum. The other thing you can do with your stone is quickly pick it up and smash something at the cost of all stats. This will instantly crush a car, but you have a high risk of dying and having to reset, so use it wisely. It will also crush the passengers of an exposed car and reduce your durability and speed loss by a good amount, which adds a little bit of strategy to this very pathetic game.\n\nPart 3) Power-ups\n\nPower-ups are unlocked with points and are limited-use with a meter. There are time slowdowns, double jumps, fast-falls, laser swords, and nerf revives. Time slowdowns slow down time (duh) by about 70% but you have normal handling &amp; controls; double jumps are self-explanatory; fast-falls instantly set you down on top of a car or the ground; nerf revives give you a free revive but with slightly lower stats, and laser swords instantly destroy a nearby car.\n\nPart 4) That's it?\n\nThat's it. It's just a high-score game involving destruction of cars, infinitely leveling up your curling stone with points, purchasing power-up meters that you have to conserve, and destroying everything in sight. If you want to make this, feel free to do this exact thing and edit anything you want as long as you slap my name in the credits somewhere. Comment anything you need to below if you want to. Thanks!"
j3kn8h,Solving problems for online survival/loot and shoot games,"Hate loot stolen when hunting? \nGood mechanic would be to add alert system that can be crafted. Such as trip wire, alarm that sounds when enemy in radius, traps like in Hunt: Showdown.\n\nHate loot stolen when you are offline?\nSimple method would be to make player home base outside play area like in Vigor. \n\nDon‚Äôt want to put a lot of monster in game?\nSolution would be to create harsh weather conditions,starve meter, temperature stats, day/night cycle. Make weather conditions plenty so player have to use different strategies to survive. \n\nOther hardship such as making player use map without the moving pointer so player have to figure out their location. Or making the monster less visible(not like out in the open)\n\nAlternatively, you can add animal behavior, how they respond to change in weather, and their interaction with other animals. \n\nCrafting feels unrealistic?\nLook at immersive games like Miasmata, Firewatch and Metro Exodus, where they don‚Äôt use a lot of pop up options. (I.e Bag shown for crafting, use compass, map to navigate, make checklists display by pen and paper)\n\nCrafting is complicated?\nDisplay each part of craft needed. Add chat so ppl can interact.\n\nMake game more realistic?\nPut in sound effects. Such as crickets and fireflies at night. Wind blowing and leaves falling in daytime. Draw inspiration from Miasmata. (Expect for the monster part) \n\nType in your problem with survival games, maybe I can help think of a way to solve."

j31uhv,This idea for a James Bond anniversary.,"Think: A new video game (the first since 2012) for the series that does right what 007: Legends did wrong in commemorating an anniversary. It would be primarily third-person, but with the ability to toggle into and out of first-person perspective gameplay. The game would consist of not one, but at least two or more original campaigns, like an anthology rather than a single campaign. Each campaign would be a homage to a Bond actor's tenure and films, featuring the likenesses of Connery, Moore, Brosnan, and possibly even Craig.\n\nCampaign 1: You play as Connery's Bond in a 1960s-recreated world, and the plot, while original, would borrow elements from his best films, including subtle references to the films themselves. Think of the From Russia with Love game, but with it's own plot and characters. Probably something revolving around Spectre.\n\nCampaign 2: You play as Moore's Bond in a 1970s world, with timely references and a suitably silly but fun original plot. Probably some sort of ""destroy the world's population and recreate it"" plot.\n\nCampaign 3: Brosnan's Bond in a 1990s-2000s world. \n\nCampaign 4: Craig's Bond in a modern world.\n\nCampaign 5: Figure out a way to combine Lazenby and Dalton's films into another plot, I would hate to leave them out even though they would obviously have less material from which to draw.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEach with their own theme songs, characters, gadgets, cars. Cinematically done, and paying proper homage to the series while being fun it its own right."

j2wwwu,Need ideas for a potion brewing game,"Hello r/gameideas!  \nI hope I'm not breaking any rules by posting a request for ideas. I'm making a game about having a potion shop, where costumers would come with a request and you would brew potions using ingredients on your inventory. The core mechanic I'm thinking about is to combine those ingredients in a certain way to achieve what your customer wants. Each ingredient would have a set of properties (for example a special leaf would have restorative properties) that when combined with other ingredients would tend to the customer's needs. All seemed good in my head until I tried to make the customers orders, I found that with a small number of ingredients I would be able to solve the game easily (for example, if I had an ingredient with restoration properties, any problem that needs healing would be solved by it). So with that in mind, I come to ask if you guys have any ideas on how to solve this problem or any reference in potion brewing that I could use as inspiration(so far I'm looking a lot at Harry Potter). Any suggestions are appreciated.  \n\n\nThank you!"

They can only see things in their cone of view.\n- They have to navigate around the dungeon looking for a treasure chest that is also randomly placed throughout the maze.\n- As players navigate around, they can sabotage each others efforts by attacking each other. Each time a player dies they get randomly spawned away from the treasure. \n- Once the chest is found, a new one is spawned elsewhere on the map\n- The match ends after a certain time limit. The player who found the most chests wins. \n- There would only be one chest on the map at time. \n- To mix things up, each player could have a different unique power."

j2emh7,Naruto Cyberpunk,"So I was practicing on my iPad earlier, creating some cyberpunk themed GUI graphics. And, started thinking about a combination of Naruto and Cyberpunk and how that might work. For example, making cyberpunk versions of all of the weapons and outfits would be pretty straight forward but for jutsu, that could be a bit more challenging. Like, would you keep Jutsu as being chakra orientated, or, could you change it so that maybe jutsu are created by cultivating chakra nanites and those nanites then form together to build the jutsu you are trying to use.\n\nFor instance, Haku's Ice Mirrors. Rather than being just ice you could design the exterior of the mirrors as metal with pipes extruding from them that pumps the ice out to form the mirror. Earth jutsu could be a hybrid of both metal and earth fused together, summoned animals could be mechanical instead of biological in nature.\n\nThe main thought is, how would the mechanics actually work. Could you have a jutsu gauntlet that contains the nanites. Would the nanites be integrated into every part of your body. Could you upgrade your body with stronger tech that contains more nanites. What stats would you progress in or would a perk based system work better?.\n\nMovement such as wall walking, super jumping, dashing etc could...maybe....all be obtained through bodily upgrades.\n\nIdk. I feel like in amongst this is a really neat and cool idea that would be pretty interesting to play.\n\nDoes anyone else have any ideas or thoughts on this that they could expand upon?."
j2davo,Survival Killing game where you are the Mastermind,"If you have heard/played Danganronpa, Your turn to die, Black Survival, you will have a grasp of how death games work. For example, twelve people are trapped in an island and are forced to kill each other to survive. The winner will be the one to escape the death game.\n\nNow, my idea for this game is you will not control one of the survivors. Instead, you will be the mastermind of the whole death game. You will have control of the surveillance cameras, coming up with motives to get the survivors battle each other and you can interfere or help survivors locked up in combat. Also, you'll have to manage the broadcast ratings of your killing game. Like, if a survivor is killed, that would boost the views. If no one died, that would lower the ratings. Also, there would be fan favorites. If they die or manage to survive, it will affect the ratings positively or negatively. If you ran out of viewers, you will lose.\n\nAnd in the end of the game, there will be a prize. The sole survivor will get their freedom, but you can also change the outcome of the game. There might be consequences though, where the sole survivor kills you instead. They might take over and become the next mastermind. Or you can turn into a good guy and help the survivor escape. There's enough room here for plot twists. Anyways, that's my idea for a game. This might work in a Visual Novel format with gameplay mechanics. Might do this in the future."

j24yza,Herbagers,"# Introduction\n\nAn FPS team-based PVP game, in which a rebellion group (The Herbagers) fight against the Green-Collars (Industrial workers), that seek to gain profit in building non-renewable energy sources. The main game mode being attack/defend, there would be three stages in each match, the readying stage in which the players choose and customise their gear and classes, the planning stage in which the attackers choose tactical advantages such as flank routes to be unlocked and health packs while the defenders place defences like turrets and traps.\n\nThe final stage is where both teams duke it out. In each attack/defend match there would be three tasks for the attackers to do, steal suspicious briefcases, capture a point to upgrade the gas generator to a solar one, etc.\n\n# Classes/gear\n\nThe player can hold two weapons (each looking different depending on which side you're on), one throwable, one deployable, and two abilities. There would be 3 main classes, attack, defend, and support. The attack class would be a nimble bullet sprayer but would be rather fragile with abilities focusing on mobility and burst damage, the defend class would be an average speed bullet sponge with rather weak attacks although with abilities focused on diversion and protection, finally, the support class would be an all-rounder with abilities focused on support (not necessarily healing) and transport.\n\nEach class would have two extra weapons for each slot, one more specialised in precision or damage, another that is a bit more gimmicky s from the main one as well as one extra ability for each slot, again, being a sidegrade. There would be three throwables to equip, a frag grenade, a smoke grenade, and a glue grenade. The abilities would have an extra one that is vastly different from the other.\n\nI hope you liked my idea, your welcome to use any of it, of course."
j24tni,More monster-less survival games please,"I'm sure this topic has been talked about to death already but I just had to bitch about it too because it's kinda sad to me. \n\nI can probably count on one hand, heck one finger the number of promising survival games without any monster, specifically zombie elements. Meanwhile the number of survival games with zombie like elements in them is so high there probably isn't a name to it yet. \n\nWhen I've first learned about scum in I don't know what year it was I was so excited. I thought finally a survival game with deep mechanics (arguably too deep) that isn't an obvious take on dayZ, that was for exactly 15 minutes until I saw it had zombies in it making it exactly like dayZ with vitamins and less bugs. \n\nA few weeks ago I finally bought my first fallout games after I've been incredibly interested in the lore for a very long time. And even in a game with so many possible creative enemies, and there is from regular people to super mutants who are basically harder to kill humans to murderous robots and irradiated wildlife they still had to include f**king feral ghouls who are zombies in all but name. I'm not saying the game isn't good, I'm addicted to it but I have to admit I was really disappointed when I first encountered them and still are.  (While I started to play fallout new Vegas first I quickly moved to fallout 4 which I'm enjoying a lot more).\n\nI'll admit I'm not the biggest survival player. My most played games are grand strategy games, I still greatly enjoy good survival games. And It pisses me off that every year a dozen shitty remakes of DayZ come out claiming to be innovative while being the exact same shitty clones of a genre that existed for more then a fucking decade. \n\nWhen PUBG came first came out (as a standalone mod of arma, same as DayZ) It was hailed as something original, which it absolutely was. When fortnite came out it took PUBG which was pretty hard core with more difficult shooting mechanics and made it accessible to a more casual audience. But soon after when the third and fourth battle royale games came out game reviewers and consumers alike yelled about how the battle royale genre was oversaturated, and rightfully so. Yet when a shitty zombie game after a shitty zombie game comes out every fucking week for a decade and a half they are at best silent or at worse hail some of those games as original or innovative while in reality they bring nothing new to the table. \n\nThat's without even mentioning how maybe 0.1% of those shitty games ever get finished let alone become good. Just look at the founder of the genre, DayZ, which took 6 long years to finally launch into a full release, by which time it was still broken and the graphics were ancient. \n\nSo what am I wishing for every night when I go to bed? That some development studio finally made a detailed open world FPP/TPP survival game, **Without zombies or any other ""supernatural elements"" like vampires or stuff**. That is hopefully more hardcore with it's survival like Scum. \n\nI think Escape From Tarkov already showed how there is a market for that type of game. \n\nThank you for coming to my exceedingly rambly Ted talk."

j20dtk,"A community Tower Defense game, but you upgrade others instead of yourself","I was thinking of a game that involves a lot of community creation and friendships among random people. You start by permanently joining a group of completely random (but not overpowered) people, and you are a part of a tower wall that has to defend your resources. However, you cannot upgrade yourself and have to rely on others to upgrade for you. The same is true for you; your resources are only usable on other people's towers. You would get informed by the game that someone had upgraded your tower for you when that happens. You can also go to battle against others and knock down their walls to win (targeting their weakest links is key).\n\nThis method of having others upgrade your own tower and not being able to leave after a loss is the key of the game; when your group loses because your part of the wall fell, it's their fault and not yours. The point of the game is to build each other up, and it's not the other person's fault if they crumble; it's yours. The game can teach humility and community to other people, and that's basically the meat of the game."

j1x45h,Zombie apocalypse but with fantasy monsters.,"Basically take your usual zombie apocalypse game but rather than zombies destroying the world, monsters like goblins and dragons did.\n\nthe game plays mostly like any open world zombie survival game i.e you try to survive by finding shelter, getting food and uncovering guns and the like.\n\nthe twist being rather than fighting zombies you would normally fight goblins and fighting monsters would be no joke i.e you would have to know the weaknesses of stronger monsters (like orcs) and a whole lot of preparation to beat them. and unlike normal fantasy games you would have to forget about fighting dragons; every time you would notice a dragon in the distance. you would have to hide and pray it doesn't nuke the town with its breath.\n\nso you then might ask yourself, isn't it a bit boring if enemies on the level of goblins are the only monsters you can beat without extensive preparation? I would say no as there will be magical secrets in this world in the form of artifacts; essentially super rare magical items that let you use magic i.e an amulet that can save your life once or a sword that can cut through steel like butter or even a staff that temporarily creates a magical barrier where you place it and etc\n\nso using a combination of guns and artifacts you would be able to deal with higher level enemies like orcs and the like without it being a suicide mission. and eventually you might even get enough artifacts to fend off a dragon but that would take a looong time.\n\nI can't be the only one who has thought of this idea but I always see having a zombie apocalypse in a fantasy world and not the other way around."
j1silb,"A grand strategy game that goes all out on suspension of disbelief, by focusing on a zombie apocalypse scenario","Because of the restricted scope, the diplomacy systems in the game can be much more simple and specialized for the zombie apocalypse. Due to widespread familiarity with zombies, the somewhat imagination-based nature (based on a page of stats or events without many pictures) of grand strategy games can work for the zombie horde.\n\nMost of the grand strategy games have a zombie mod, and the gameplay would be a less glitchy version of these mods. Essentially one province is the start of the zombie horde, gets massive numbers of weak military units representing zombie swarms and spreads outward. The rest of the gameplay is emergent from the zombie horde expanding extremely rapidly, and nations'/players' choice to cooperate against the zombies or betray each other to buy themselves more time which may backfire as the horde grows elsewhere."

j1nz4w,"A game where you can take your eye out and throw it. Wherever it goes, that's where the game camera goes.","You play as a Mike Wazowski-type creature with a giant eye, which can be removed and thrown. The eye is still attached to the optic nerve, of course, so it eventually springs back into the eye socket. But when it is away from the player, the camera follows.   \n\n\nThis could lead to some interesting puzzles involving camera perspective. Say you encounter two pathways, one with an incredibly strong enemy who can instantly kill you in one shot, and one with a treasure chest. You need to use your removable eye to determine the safest path. You could also find a way to trap the eye in a certain area while the player goes and does something else. You need to be careful though, because the eye can be separated from the optic nerve if it is hit, in which case you need to wander around in the dark to recover it. Once recovered, you can see normally.

j1lx03,What every apocalypse survival games need,"-Character stats and progression.\n-karma system. Killing other players gives -karma, IF they have good karma themselfs. Killing players with bad karma gives you good karma.\n-dying wont reset your character progression, but give you debuff / decrease in stats.\n\nI think these ideas would counter 'kill on sight' and make so the player actually value their life."
j1lgys,Apocalypse game set in Norway,"I live in Norway, and I've always wanted to make a apocalypse game (or perhaps a DayZ mod) set in Norway. Most people in Norway doesnt own guns, so finding gun would be rare, and combat would mostly be melee. If you happend to find a gun it would probably be hunting weapons only, and military weapons would be very rare."
j1l0hu,"New Pokemon game, but its SSB",Here's the idea. 2D platform fighter that follows Super Smash Bros' format of fighting but its with Pokemon. Each Pokemon has 4 special moves (same as smash) and each time a Pokemon is knocked out you switch to another one. You unlock new Pokemon in a story mode of sorts that basically takes Pokemon's general idea of a game for story and combines it with a SSB type thing (think Subspace Emissary with a World of Light style map). Obviously this idea would have to come from Nintendo but I am hoping that there's somebody in this sub that works for them or has a way to be in contact with them.
j1kw8q,"A Hero Based Game (overwatch, league, SSB) where you make your own Characters","Basically the idea is just that you have a point system where you spend points to give your character power (movement abilities, combat abilities utility, ultimate, passives, primary attack, secondary attack, base stats) but the more powerful an ability is, the more points it costs to have (you could have a slider system that affects has a point multiplier).  Also you could have an in depth character customization system that allows players it express what they want their character to be.  I'm imagining in terms of gameplay a 3rd person br similar to spellbreak where you loot for stat improvements (cool down reduction, base stat improvement, damage increase, longer lasting abilities, more charges) that you can trade with your teammates to use most effectively, really though, I the depth of character creation should is what I want and that could fit into any genre she'll, from dungeon crawler to moba.  In terms of microtransactions and monetization, that should be for cosmetics only, not for new types of abilities, as I would want the actual ability creation to be completely accessable from the first time you open up the game.  Honestly, I'm don't think this concept would work unless you had some kind of built in way to 3d model stuff for like hitboxes and basic ability effects and object creation which makes me think this game concept just isn't feasible especially for a non AAA team, but I still thought it was just a fun ""in a perfect world"" concept"

j1b2gn,I think I may go back to the original concept.,"I talked a bit about my game concept in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/ivpjao/realistic_vs_convenient/), but I havent really mentioned much about the game concept as a whole, except maybe a very basic breakdown to another user. Now that I think about it, I may or may not go back to my original concept, however, I would like to know what you people think.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe current concept (a prototype of a ""prototype/predecessor"" game on which the actual game will be based):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\- A personal sandbox with programming feature.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\- The game's OS and hardware behave much more like in real life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\- OS is close to a UNIX or UNIX-like operating system.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\- A ""Kernel"" with hardcoded ""programs"" and a file system much like UNIX. A collection of basic mechanics, really.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\- Hardware matters, and are the driving component of the game, for example, you'd  be able to work much more efficienttly with a CPU with more cores and a bigger RAM or HDD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\- More or less a point-and-click built upon a text-based game (the game takes input from both mouse and keyboard, and if you wish you can deactivate the OS's graphical interface or not have a GPU at all you can simply have the game be command line based).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\- Game's equivalent to XOrg/XWindow (procedural Mesh that act as the game's ""windows"")\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\- Ideally, a ""low"", and a ""high"" programming language, that are basically just bits of code (defined by keywords) controlling the processor, mostly pushing a value from one component to another. They are much closer to actual programming languages than in the original concept. I played with the idea to build the ""high"" language on the ""low"" language, but while I want the game to ""slow down"" a bit, I'm not quite sure if it is that great for performance. Maybe I'll try that in ""Arch Mode""\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\- A pre-deined OS that is mostly hard-coded, but with the ability to change and customize and be more efficient using aforementioned programming. If all fails, you can boot an ""Emergency Floppy"" that is a command-line based version of the OS with very basic functions. There would also be an ""Arch Mode"" that lets you customize or build from scratch. Arch Mode is basically the creative mode that starts you from the Emergency Floppy and you start to build from there. It's what I'm looking most forward to, personally.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\- Custom ""Files"" and ""Programs"". ""Files"" are basically the container that hold information, and ""Programs"", is what can be executed. Files of non-executable or non-compiled programs hold the information and a pointer to the position the program it should open it with on the HDD, from which it draws the file ""size"". Executable program files simply point to the HDD and loads the tokens needed from there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\- File protection mechanic that can help against attackers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\- Everything goes through the Processor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\- Aquire or unlock new hardware to improve you computer and your OS's performance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Hacking simulation based on the current concept:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\- Online or Offline.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\- In-Game surface- and deep-web as well as darknet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\- In-Game ""Networks"" and ""Servers"", think of it as the OS as your home, the ""Network"" as your guild or your guild's base, and the ""Server"" as your guild base's location.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\- Network ""Connections"" can be cut. You basically have no connection to anyone or anything at all. Just your OS. You can't get hacked that way either, but ""malware""/""viruses""/""trojans"" or ""worms"" (potentially dangerous programs someone else wrote) may still harm you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\- Starting hub/server is hard-coded and can never be hacked. Pre-defined ""Servers"" that you can rent (in-game) to establish your network and maybe use as a presence for making money, simply a ""base"" for your group, or an open community hub are also safer. However everything outside these pre-defined servers and pages are randomly generated and may be potentially harmful or have no protection mechanic at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\- In case of attack the Server provide may inform you that an outside may have attempted to gain access. There may also be a warning for system/network foreign files.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\- NO real life money involved in any form that may count as P2W. Just to make sure.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\- Ways to make money/potential jobs. And also a way to offer money for doing a job and setting a goal that defines when a job is fulfilled.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\- Your OS CAN be compromised, however that is much, MUCH harder than gaining access to a server. Pre-defined hubs will also be much faster to track you if you are on said hub.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\- There WILL be  footprints, tracing, and law enforcement that act as safety machanic. Gaining access to a server without authirzation WILL gain you a criminal record if it can be traced back.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\- Bank, law enforcement and gopvernmental servers and pre-defined hubs have the highest security that will be very tough to crack even if you are in ""end-game"".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\- Being a cyber-criminal WILL have consequences as a result.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\- You get caught, it's pretty much game-over for you, unless you either destroy the evidence in your server, your HDD or whatever or quit the server or destroy your computer. In other words, you can't do anything anymore.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\- The darknet has almost none of these above mentioned safety mechanics, but is also much more dangerous. You enter the darknet, you are in danger of losing everything. Everything.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\- It would have an Arch Mode, but it can't be used online. And writing your own custom OS would require a lot of online time and cost a lot of money.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe original hacking simulation game concept:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\- Hardware is important, but not the driving component.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\- Stuff will still go through the processor, but it would be much simpler.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\- The game itself is a mix of Uplink, Welcome To tThe Game, Tis-100 and While(True){Learn()} (Or whatever it is called), set in an UNIX-like OS.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\- You have a programming mechanic similar to the latter two games mentioned above, where you have a set of pre-diefined ""code"", in form of ONLY a ""high"" language. The variables can be individually named and given a value that fits the type. Some functions also can pass a parameter (which will also be the return value, if it returns a value). You can also make a ""custom function"" that is a function that contains other functions and variables. They can be stringed together by writing them out, drag and drop, or a drop-down menu (I'm not sure if it should be done by drag and drop or dropdown menu) to achieve the desired effect. All functions and instructions are game objects, unlike in the current concept that would handle it much more like an actual programming language.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\- The ""high"" language can act as both script and compiled language. Compiled it runs faster, scruipted it can be used for efficiency, like for example to automatically move a file from one directory to another whenever a file is dropped into that directory, but also for the hacking mechanic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\- Files, in that case, are pretty much just containers and while they work pretty much like in the current concept (depending if they can be exectued or not), the difference is not that significant other than they can't be opened by any other program.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\- OS and File/Program handling are pretty much still the same as above.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\- Like parts of codes in WTTG, you find bits of code by using the surface web or darknet or buying libraries and headers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\- It would still have an Arch Mode, but it would be different. There would be more emphasis on modding, rather than having a sandbox.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\- Still can be used with or witthout GUI, so with mouse or keyboard input. There would also be an emergency floppy still.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\- The hacking itself is a minigame, rather than a player's progress. I imagine it being in a window much like you would see in Tetris or Pipe dream. The attacker's motive is to use the tools (trace, for example) and ""programs""/""scripts"" to gain access to the system and gain control of the superuser account by locking the defendand out, the defandand's task to remain in control using commandline prompts and lock the attacker out. NPC defendands will also trace you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\- The rest is pretty much like in the current concept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShould I keep it or go back to the original?"

j16ujs,Blind Chef and Seeker Frog,"Mechanics:It's a two player game where someone is a frog who hops around a kitchen, and someone is a blind chef cooking meals. The chef cannot see but has a telepathic connection with the frog, allowing the chef to see through the frog's eyes. The frog has a small circle around them, showing the player where they can move. The Chef can move around the kitchen and move their hands and arms to cook. As the local chef you will get orders from people and have to complete as much orders as you can before closing time. Luckily the people of Gorge Hill are very patient.

Their will also be a blue bar on the side showing the frogs moisture.\n\nFinal: I know this is a big game but I just wanted to put it down on the internet."
j16b8p,"Thought of a concept for an rpg fighting game: ""Starburnt Brawl""","I have an idea for a video game that is a mix of a fighting game such as Street Fighter or King of Fighters and an RPG such as Paper Mario or Final Fantasy. The main essence of the game is that you must defeat your enemy by executing moves in a RPS/turn-based arena and performing combos on your opponent to defeat them.\n\nThere are a few gimmicks in this game that I would like to explain (the boost mechanic, the turn-based RPS mechanic, the combo and attack mechanic, the defense mechanic, and the crush mechanics) and get feedback on, so please let me know any flaws there would be in this game.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. The boost system\n\nBoosting is the main part of this game. Without boosting, there wouldn't be any point of the game. You boost via collecting star energy in your boost meter, which is how the in-game world works (the story is still something I need to create).\n\nYou receive boosts via shielding, which gives you one boost, and meditating, which gives you two. The maximum amount of boosts usable in one turn is three, while the maximum capacity you will have in the meter can be six. However, having more than four stored at a time will 'starburn' you, which will have certain side effects.\n\nBeing starburnt will slightly increase your damage output but it deals damage to yourself each turn (about 8%), so you need to be careful about how you use your boosts. On the plus side, maximizing your meter unlocks a very powerful move, which will be explained further below.\n\n2. The turn system\n\nThe first part of the game is the turn system, where both people select what they will do during their turns. The selections there will be are attacks, combos, shielding, and meditating, which each fulfills a specific role. You can also be 'crushed', which will stun you and leave you defenseless for a turn, and 'starcrushed', which I will explain later.\n\nStandard attacks are exactly what they sound like - normal attacks. If you end up hitting one on a defenseless opponent, though, they will give you a boost point. Combos are the second form of attack that you can get, and is the main part of the game's attacking system, which can give you maximum possible damage and takes advantage of boosting. Defending will reduce incoming damage and give you an extra boost point, but defending too much can be exploited and you can be crushed. Finally, meditating is a riskier defense mechanism that gives you two boost points and increases attack next turn, but leaves you defenseless to all attacks.\n\nEach move has to be strategically chosen, though, since the choices available interact in various ways seen further below in turn interactions.\n\n3. Executing combos and attacks\n\nCombos are the bread-and-butter of the game. They can be executed by command inputs and combo cards, but if failed, it will waste the turn. This is the best and most reliable way to beat an opponent due to how combos interact with boost points. If you decide to boost your combo, you can create a better and longer combo, but that requires more command inputs in order to maximize effectiveness of your moves.\n\nA combo is chosen by your combo cards, which selects the command inputs that you have to do to execute your combo. You get a maximum of five combo cards per turn and can sort them how you please. When you combo, you must select one combo card per time a boost is used + 1 (for example: no boosts = 1 card, 1 boost = 2 cards, 3 boosts = 4 cards). For each combo card you use, you must memorize the inputs for each card and execute them on your opponent. A combo will be executed and deal damage based on how well you did your input. If you completely mess up the input, your combo and turn ends there. If you are confused, let me know.\n\n4. The defense/boost system\n\nYour defense, shielding and meditating, is the main way that you will gain any boost points and is essentially how you win. Shielding is less risky than meditating, but meditation is more beneficial for setting up.\n\nShielding is the first defense mechanism that you have. When you shield, you gain a single boost point and reduce incoming damage by a small amount (unless both people defend, which reduces defense effectiveness by 30%). Defending is the least risky option that you have, but you cannot use it too often or your opponent will exploit it. To defend, select the defend option and click a button on time to defend.\n\nMeditating is the other defense mechanism that you can use; however, it is much more risky and rewarding to meditate rather than shielding. Meditation will give you two boost points and will increase your attack on the next turn by 20%. On the other hand, it will leave you vulnerable to all attacks.\n\n5. Turn interactions\n\nThese are the interactions that will happen if two players do the same thing: If both players attack, they will each take an average amount of damage. If both players combo, the one that does the initial command input first will win the interaction and be able to finish their combo. If both players defend by shield, they each gain a boost point but the next time they defend their shield will be weakened. If both players meditate, they enter a menu where they can compromise whether they both get two or three boost points (disagreement results in one point).\n\nHere are the interactions between two different actions involving an attack: If one player attacks and the other combos with less than net one boost points, the attack wins and deals damage to the comboer. If one player attacks the other combos with net one or more boost points, the combo wins and can finish their combo. If one player attacks and the other shields, the shielder takes a small amount of damage and gains their boost point. If one attacks and the other meditates, the attacker does an increased amount of damage to the meditator and gains a boost point.\n\nHere are the remaining unique interactions: If one player combos and the other defends, the combo does reduced damage for the first two hits and the shielder gains their boost point. If a combo meets a meditator, the comboer wins by default and can finish. If a shielder interacts with a meditator, the shielder gains their boost point but their shield weakens next time they use it; the meditator gains two boost points and will increase their attack by 30%.\n\n6. The crush and starcrush powers\n\nThe crush and starcrush powers are the shield-breaks and final smashes of Starburnt Brawl. These each do great amounts of damage and have certain effects. However, crushing costs three boost points and starcrushing costs six boost points, and each move can be countered with precise timing and power.\n\nCrushing an enemy can do one of two things: Crushing a defenseless opponent will deal a fixed 40% amount of damage. However, this can be countered by a three-boost combo executed well and will be rendered useless. Crushing a shielding opponent will deal a fixed 30% damage and will stun the enemy for the next turn, leaving them defenseless and open to attack.\n\nStarcrushing an enemy is extremely powerful, dealing a fixed 80% damage to a defenseless opponent and 60% damage to a defending opponent. This can only be countered by a completely random two-step command input given to an attacking or comboing target that can only be executed within a very short time period. This essentially wins the game for the user, but be careful! You will have to be starburnt for at least one turn in order to do this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHave any questions or comments? Please let me know what they are and I will address you about it sooner or later. Thank you so much!"

j157nv,A Detective game idea,So I was brainstorming some ideas for my next game and here it is :\n\nMain : You play as a mail carrier and detective/P.I\n\n\nSetting : I imagine this game in a tropical setting with sci-fi elements such as holograms  \n\nGameplay : You play as a mail carrier during part of the day. Delivering mail allows you to interact with those in the community. As you're interacting with them you'll also be able to pick up investigation jobs. \n\nOnce you have an active job you might can look at people's mail as you investigate them so that you can get info. It's possible that you'll also be able to sneak into their homes.\n\nOverall I feel that there might be a core storyline but I'm not sure what that'll be yet.\n\nI also know I'll have to scale the scope down but for now I'm just thinking of the general idea\n\nAny Ideas/suggestion ?
j14nmv,Science Fiction RTS game.,"I had a dream, literally, of an RTS game set in a dystopian future where an oppressive, tyrannical regime had united the earth under its iron gauntlet. \n\n     It involved large units and playing fields, imagine a fusion of Supreme Commander and Command &amp; Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars. Large, imposing robots, large battleships, enviromental destruction which could be strategically used to hinder or outright destroy enemy units. \n \n    What if you could order your tank to fire on a building, causing it to collapse and block the path of incoming enemy units? Or what if you could order your artillery units to fire on a bridge as the enemy crosses it, thus anihilating all units crossing it?  \n\n     Things like this bring me to think of many strategic options where the enviroment could be used. A lone unit played with great skill, like the Commandos from C&amp;C, would be a true pest for inexperienced players, as gurilla warfare and infantry that would be used by the rebellion could stand more of a chance against the metallic monsters the tyrannical government would throw at them. \n\n     I imagine the playstyles of the gov would consist of heavy hitting, slow, heavy armoured units that steamroll, while the rebellion would need to be stealthier, nimbler, and more flexible in order to contend with the gov. A faction about wits and playing mind games. \n\n     I hope you all enjoyed this one. It all literally came to me in a dream so it may not be perfect. I'd like to hear what you guys and gals think. If you wish to discuss things in more detail, please DM me. Dont be shy."
j14ir1,A third person faction based multiplayer game.,"     This concept literally came to me in a dream I had, no joke. I often have dreams where qualities of many video games I like are combined into the most amazing video game I'll never get to play. (Sad right?)  Anyhow lets get to the meat of it now.\n\n     So to begin I shall introduce what inspired my idea to begin with. I've always been a fan of sci-fi media, whether it be video games, movies, you name it. I've played a few of these games which has a certain style to it that I find to be so memorable and great to experience. The ones that will be mentioned here are Red Faction: Guerilla which may be known for its large enviromental destruction mechanics and fast paced third person gameplay and the Planetside series, known for its large faction wars and large scale warfare.\n\n     I had the idea in my dream. Wjat if we had a scifi videogame with the fluid, amazing combat of Red Faction: Guerilla, and put that with the faction war idea of Planetside? Now I know you must be thinking: ""Oh brother, this guy is way over his head, this would take eons to make!"" and to that I agree. I know it is too large scale of a concept to be produced by indie devs. Bu fear not, I understand there are ways we can adapt this idea into a smaller frame. We dont need this to be a super big war MMO with beautiful graphics of another planet, entire lore backstories behind every type of mass produced weapon model, etc. (That would be tripple A level. Leave that to the super large Free to play games. xD)\n\n      On a smaller scale, I can imagine it playing like a third person scifi Battlefield in which teams complete objectives depending on the game mode. Kind of like Star Wars: Battlefront actually. But the spin would be about having a good immersive story, since graphics and polishing would be a sure limitation. As for lore and story. I can write up a whole cannon universe by myself if need be.\n\n     So in summary of what the idea is... It is a fluent, fast paced third person shooter with team tactics, faction wars, (I know alternative ways to do faction wars since a planetside 2 type of war would be way beyond the capeabilities of indie devs.) I'd add vehicular combat like that of the Halo franchise with vehicles themed to fit the faction that can be deployable. For balence purposes ai imagine there would be catagories, or classes to vehicles for example: APC, Light Tank, Heavy Tank, Scout, then build from there for faction uniquity. \n\n     Anyways. If anyone wants to talk about this and have me expand upon specifics better, please DM me. I'd love to exhange ideas with other and perhaps be mind blown when someone presents an even better way to execute things. xD"

Upon killing others, you receive one ""Gratitude"", which can be redeemed at a shopkeeper on the map for better weapons or utilities.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, each player is assigned an ""Ambition"" at the start of the game. Ambitions alter what things they start with and their goal. They do not always alter starting items.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  Examples:  \n\n\n""Pride"" - You want everyone to know you're the best killer. You win once you kill 3 people in full sight of 3 other people. \n\n  \n""Sacrifice"" - You must sacrifice victims. You start with the ""Sacrificial Knife"" melee item, which is aesthetic. Each melee kill has the body dragged underground by a dark force. With 4 melee kills, you may enter the ""Old One"" form, where the entire map is abyssal and terrifying. From here, you win by killing one player. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n""Justice"" - You have an agenda to uphold. You start with a ""Police Badge"" utility, which can be held to prevent being targeted by automatic aiming systems such as turrets or landmines. You also start with ""Handcuffs"", and win by arresting 3 people holding a Bomb or Automatic Weapon.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n""Vengeance"" - You are avenging a loved one. You start with a ""Paper"", which can be held to show you who your target is. Once you kill the person on the paper with no one witnessing their death, you win.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n""Profit"" - You are scavenging for quick cash. Each gun you pick up may be sold to the Shopkeeper for 1 Gratitude. You win by having 15 Gratitudes. You lose 1 Gratitude on death.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n""Honor"" - You must uphold your code of honor, and hold others to the same. You have a meter called ""Honorbound"", which goes up to 10. You start with an item called the ""Tombstone"". You may gain honor by:\n\n  \nMartyrdom (Dying to a knife)\n\nBurial Rights (Planting a Tombstone on a recently killed corpse)\n\nDueling (Killing someone with a Pistol)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou lose Honor by:  \n\n\nKilling a player only holding a pistol with an Automatic Weapon.\n\nTaking a weapon from the ground that is clearly not yours.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAside from the moral and ethical message this game tries to send, I think it works in theory and chaos."

jj57lc,Competitive tree species evolution,"Generations happen every 30seconds, and each generation you can adjust some phenotype sliders and toggles (reproductive rate, seed transmission method, growth rate, leaf size, branching frequency). The trees currently alive don't get the evolutionary change. You can only change a little bit each generation, and changes have trade offs.\n\nAll players start with one tree in a circle, and want to maximize number of trees before the end. Other player's choices will effect your player, as well as environmental factors such as animals carrying seeds, sunlight, and animals doing harm to you (maybe you should have gotten thicker bark, or poisonus sap, or less tasty seeds).\n\nThis could really have any number of players, and it could be played fast or a slow every day game."
jj4qt7,Multiplayer Roguelike Race,"Doubt this is possible for me to achieve (right now anyways).\n\nEach game would have a randomly generated dungeon that the players have to traverse. The host would be able to customise how many floors there should be and what theme they should have along with how much HP and speed players should have/move at. There should also be a setting to turn hunger on. Players would take damage fast when they run out of food.\n\nOn another note, I'd like the players to only be able to carry one item at a time. However, there will also be upgrades/power ups which don't count as carryable items. They would remain equipped until the floor is done or they die depending on the host' settings. The host would also choose what items/upgrades can/can't spawn.\n\nThe players should be facing random enemies and the host would be able to choose what monster can/can't spawn. In order to get past these monsters, a variety of items and tools will spawn. Some monsters would be recruitable or rideable with certain items.\n\nThe host would also be able to choose what bosses can/can't spawn.\n\nDead players would respawn at the start of the floor or if that place is obstructed somewhere else on the map. They would also leave corpses behind.\n\nAt the start of the game there would likely have to be a invincibility timer in which players can't harm each other or they would start from different locations.\n\nThe game would need to be pretty systemic."

If there is a win condition, it could be to act on the biggest theater in the Capital City or at the King's Castle.\n\n### Game mechanics\n\nThe main mechanic would be to manage the hiring/firing of performers and to select the main function's program. Daily cost would depend on how many performers are in the company and earnings depend on the shows success. If you loose all the money is game over.\n\n#### Other possible mechanics\n\n- Instead of an ""automatic main function"", there could be a minigame for each act. The better you do the minigame, the better the act is performed (and the more money you get from the public).\n- Events during the travels between villages / towns: bandits, merchants, encounters with other caravans (that could teach you new acts), ...\n- More complex performer's state: fatigue (if they work too much), mood, relationships between them, ...?\n- Manage performer's training and learning new tricks.\n- Inventory management: instead of just paying X money each day, you need to manage the food supply, tools and materials to repair the carriages, circus tents, ...\n- Buy/sell better/bigger carriages: the better the performer's carriage, the better the mood."
jj096n,Game Audio Design and Physics,"Similar to how Arma has the design to change the amount of light you see depending on where you look, e.g. when you look into the shadows everything in the sunlight is overexposed yet the shadows are clear, having audio that is dependent on proximity and having a realistic noise level would be cool.

jith67,In-Spectre; 3d game where a ghost detective solves a case!,"The idea i had here is a 3d open map puzzle game. You an American private Investigator who enters a snowy foreign town to find a missing girl. (wait Ii'm going somewhere with this) The first day you get there you head straight to your hotel room and the screen goes black, your character wakes up to find a corpse in the armchair, he realises it is him! Suddenly he also has the objective of finding out who killed him and why. To do this, his spirit dons a backup set of clothes and takes his hat off of his corpse. At this point you walk around investigating things progression is make by solving the case which advances time, the whole game takes the course of about 3 days. You can walk in a 3d town and use your clothes form to talk to people was the detective but can ditch them to become an invisible ghost who can still interact with objects but can walk through grating and other non completely hard objects you can also don armor to be stroong, have a sword, and be a knight. You solve the case by completing puzzles, from layton-esque mini-puzzles that are self contained (like putting a broken key back together, helping out around the hotel, and figuring out the combination for a lock), to environmental puzzles (such as ditching your clothes to walk through a bar gate and unlocking it from the other side, or wearing a tough suit of armor to protect from dangerous things), to even interviews and interrigations (where you question a person and use testimony gained against them, or interregations where you just pull out a gun and do the interviews messing with how intense you are to get a better response.) You could even make friends with animals who can help you with some puzzles or are just some neat bonus stuff. The whole game was inspired by the idea of a grizzled dead detective and the visual idea I have fir it is sort of old ps2 3d but with the crunchy compressed nature of 3ds 3d. It would switch to 2d for the mini puzzles and interviews. The plot would end up with the girl having been kidnapped by a crazy Italian gangster who fashions himself a relative to a great general, he needs her bloodline to open a door to amazing treasure and you stop him using ghostly powers and puzzling wit. I think this would all be great as we have stuff that toys with being a ghost but never seems to go whole hog and combining it with puzzles like Layton and other environmental puzzles could end up being great. It would be a single player game with some hours of content. The platform would likely be PC but i could see it going elsewhere. If I ever could I would want to make this, or help make this, one day but if not all the credit I would need is a tiny mention in the credits. Please tell me your thoughts! Thank you.!"
jitba3,A survival game where you name everything,"I was playing Journey To The Savage Planet with a friend. It is a survival game in which you explore areas with unique wildlife while you search for a way to escape, basically. It's like Subnautica, Ark, Conan exiles, ect, basically like most survival games. This game is more focused on scanning things and learning what they are, which is why it sparked this idea, because, usually when we found a creature before we even knew its name we would already have something to call it. Sometimes it would be based on the sound it made or some silly thing that we fixated on but we would make something up. And despite finding out the names of said creature, we usually still called it the name we made up.\n\nSo this got me thinking what if there was no ""official"" names for creatures? What if you had to put in its name, or else it will remain a nameless creature in your log. Never once should there be a hint to an actual name of the creature and instead the player should just name it whatever they think fits. I feel this would make interesting discussions with friends as well as an interesting reason to watch others playthroughs of the game. Seeing how people built up a way to communicate about these things in the game.\n\nAlso what if it didn't stop at creatures? How about areas, items, mechanics, stars, abstract things, anything! It mostly would come down to the scope of the game on where it stops. But for the game to work I think it would need to have multiplayer along with a heavy focus on exploration. And most survival games usually have that, so I would think that they could be retrofitted with this idea.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso there are some games that seem like they have this to some extent like No Man's Sky and maybe Starbound..?(I don't remember if you can name them yourself but I believe they have random names). They seem to have it as an optional thing and on procedural creatures, making naming something kinda meaningless in my opinion. The way I think about it is that it isn't optional! It's the only way to have a name for it, a way to quickly say what you're talking about.\n\nI'm not too sure how well this would work but if a game like this came out I would love to play it! Thanks for reading! c:"

You only have one life and if you die you can never play the game again (the game locks and you can't start another game). After you die your username + how many days you survived is posted on a leaderboard which you can view ingame (after you die you can still load up the game to view the leaderboard) or on the game's website. You can see where you ranked compared to people across the world and in your country. To prevent players from just hiding to survive zombies can break walls and structures players create (game could have block placing or walls to build with materials, whatever the game dev decides). The zombies are slow and easy to kill during the day, but at night there are hoards and they can move faster. There doesn't have to be many items in the game, just bandages, health packs, melee weapons, guns, ammo, armor, and materials to build with. Items can be found in houses and abandoned cars.

After a member is voted off the scene switches to the player that got kicked off and they're given 10 seconds to say whatever they want before they‚Äôre booted off the island (something silly like a huge boot kicking them into the ocean or something).

ji0jwf,Solar System Strategy Game,"So I had an idea in which you control a nation on Earth, and you have to establish colonies around the Solar System to expand your power, economy, ect. You'd be able to watch each colony grow, and deal with political issues from them, economic issues, and issues at home. The end goal would be to unite the Earth through a variety of means, or to establish colonies on every major world and essentially become a Solar Superpower."

jhyhwa,Project Help!," Hey everyone!\n\nI'm currently in my final year of college, and I'm doing a dissertation on adaptive technology for gaming regarding people with physical disabilities. I'm focusing mainly on mobility impairments, so people that just cannot gain full control of limbs, movement, etc.\n\nFor this, I need to research this area and also code and create a project to accompany it. My main focus is gaming, so I was hoping to create a game of some sort to pair with my paper. This is the part I'm stuck with.\n\nI can't figure out what sort of game I could create, and was hoping for some ideas to be thrown under this post. The issue is that there isn't necessarily a boundary on video games (as far as I know?) for people with these disabilities. It's possible to play games of all sorts given the right equipment.\n\nIf anyone has any ideas or any interesting information, points, inspirations or resources that could help guide me I would be unbelievably grateful. I really think this area needs to be more acknowledged in the gaming communities, so I'm really hoping I can do it justice.\n\nThanks!"
jhy7e1,Watching Predators last night and came up with a concept. (spoilers for that movie if you've never seen it.),"Now, it's certainly not the best movie, but it's still fun. It had been awhile since I had seen it and completely forgot about the Laurence Fishburne character. His time in the movie is very short (about 20 minutes) and in that he reveals lore about the planet the main group is on, about the Predators and how they're in the middle of a blood feud, all while he has survived ten hunting seasons hiding and strategizing, while also turning bat shit crazy. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow freakin' cool would an open world predator game be with the concept of being gathering resources, making traps, and surviving like that character? Potentially a Dying Light aspect, where during the day the predators stalk and observe your actions, watch you battle other alien forces or even other humans and strike at night kind of thing. I thought it was a cool idea, and I certainly know open world games are done to death, but if I had the know how to make this I would."
jhxkpw,2D Mobile Platformer,"I had an idea for a 2D platformer where you have to dodge falling crates. In a portrait aspect ratio you control a player that can run left and right, jump, wall jump, and slide on the ground or crate. The game would be divided into levels with increasing difficulty. There are different types of falling crates, which spawn a ghost to warn the player before the actual physics objects appears and starts to fall.\n\nFor example:\n1.	regular crates, which spawn and fall at a regular speed; \n2.	fast crates, they have a different color and fall at a faster rate; \n3.	bomb crates, which fall at a regular speed and if you jump on top of one it will trigger a quick timer and explode afterwards, if it lands to the ground it will start the timer and blow up afterwards; \n4.	spike crates, which have spikes on top and the player cannot land on it; \n5.	reverse gravity crates, which after landing on the ground will shoot up in a few seconds and the player will be crushed with the ceiling; \n6.	magnet crates, where two crates fall down on the opposite left/right side of the screen and in a few seconds will shoot up close together and can crush the player;\n7.	poles, a pole may land on the far left or right and after a moment it will fall sideways. \n8.	slippery crates, regular crates but slippery.\n\nTo add some challenge, throughout each level, 5 special coins will appear for a short while (a timer may appear on the coin) and the player has to figure out how to grab them considering the current layout of falling crates. \n\nI also thought of a possible survival multiplayer mode where up to 4 players can play. In this mode the players cannot touch each other, however powerup boxes will appear and if a player gets one, he will have a chance to get:\n1.	Teleport powerup: which allows the player to teleport another player to his current location. Player A could use this when a crate is about to fall on top on him to teleport Player B and afterwards dash quickly out of the falling crate, giving little time to the teleported player B to dodge.\n2.	Slowdown powerup: which slows down another player for 2 seconds\n3.	Invincibility: Player that uses it cannot take damage for 3 seconds.\n\n\nI think some mega man games have these mechanics if im not mistaken. But this could be a fun mobile game. Tell me what you think. Heres some art I made of what it could look like.\nhttps://i.imgur.com/ilnRl2i.jpg"
jhwkzd,Any game ideas,Please help me
jhvzz3,Hi there! I want to share with you the news I'm proud of.,"I always dreamt of creating some game by my own. But I used to lack enough time and I didn't know where to find sufficient financing. But I didn't want to give up.  I have vivid imagination and I really wanted to do at least a low-budjet game of mine. Fortunately, one day I met a guy who was also a dreamer and who decided to help me on my way to my first game. I can't explain the happiness I was filled with when I realised that on the way to my dream I wasn't alone anymore. More than 1,5 year has passed since we started working on the project. And now it is about to be launched! \n\nI'm writting this to inspire you, as now I understand that everything in this life is possible. You just need to find your soulmates. \n\nBtw, this is my game:\n\n[Game description](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1324830/Untale_King_of_Revinia/?beta=0)\n\nI would be pleased if you  said what you think of it;)"
jhuvz2,An online rpg where you get to explore the undergrounds of a mysterious vertical world.,"As a gamer, I really like playing games that occurs on caves, tunnels, pits. I love the Metro saga, I love Hollow knight, and it makes me regret that the vast majority of modern open worlds are played in vast horizontal maps, where everything can be seen in the distance and the sky is the only roof.\n\nWhat I think would be really cool is a game where players are released in a vast underground network, and get to explore it by going deeper and deeper. By introducing a system of threat-level, you could make the exploration more and more difficult, to the point that it is impossible to reach the deepest part of the map without a high-level. Also, some random events could cause some tunnels to become unpracticable (like inondations, or the roof collapses), forcing players to take hazardous secondary paths. Secret passages would be available to jump between areas more easily, and completely new areas could be added by building them sideways to original areas. \nIn total the map could be hundreds of kilometers-deep and only a few kilometers-wide."

jhqqh5,Thirst Person Perspective,"Yes I'm proud of the title. A 2v2 gamemode that involves a Ground Person and an Air Person. The ground person relies on the Air Guy for a third person perspective and have the advantages that it brings, seeing over walls etc. If the air guy is killed,then ground guy is forced into a First Person Perspective while the opposing players will have TPP and FPP.  The air person has a semi supportive role, being responsible for recon for their teammate and potentially being a distraction. Air dudes have melee weapons and need to get in close if they are to eliminate the opposers. Once both are eliminated, the round ends. Best of 3. It's 2am and I was just thinking about game Ideas and this cake to mind, and I am aware there are various inconsistencies but I just wanted to post this and get some input of whether this would be a good concept for a shooter and put a fun twist on mechanics that are second nature to us."
jhppi0,"Fantasy MMO, breaking the genre","The typical MMO formula has become stale and consists of too much work.\n\nNo longer do you earn gear or levels.  Now you earn and collect new spells, abilities and attacks.  \n\nNo longer are you forced into a class, you use your collection to be any style you want. (Limits on amount used at a time).\n\nNo longer are dungeons mindless, because now the dungeons you are attacking are managed by the enemy players.\n\nNo longer are you doing thousands of quests, your only quest is to conquer more land for your faction.\n\nNo longer is death painless, you can lose something from your collection of spells, abilities and attacks (rules may apply).\n\nNo longer is crafting useless, it is now the most important aspect of the game for creating items, gear, spells, abilities and attacks.  All ingredients are spawned in world, not dropped from mobs, but may require an ability to procure.\n\nNo longer are cities, towns, land or zones abandoned by players, each zone controls crucial ingredients for different crafting recipes.\n\n.\n.\nDid I mention that high tier spells/abilities/attacks are one time use?  The more ingredients used the higher tier spell it becomes."
jhp6g4,violent sort-of-roguelike open world endless runner,"I recall reading a draft of a story where some dude just starts running like a maniac until he fucking dies. The details of how it went aren't very important here, but where my mind went with it was this:\n\nA Rage Virus type infection gets a guy.  He doesn't start attacking others, just starts running.  If he stops he dies.  If he falls or gets hit by a car or something he dies.  Maybe he dies from running too hard.  Point is he runs until he dies.  \n\nThen someone who witnessed the death starts running.\n\nThe idea is it would be set in a city.  It would be kind of like a streamlined Mirror's Edge sort of thing; simplified controls, to keep it closer to an endless runner, but still some parkour mechanics.  It would need to be heavily populated with NPCs to ensure that whenever the player eats shit, an NPC has line of sight to it.  The world might be at least partly randomly/procedurally generated, but the NPC placement would definitely be.\n\nYou start running (and the sound design would include frantic babbling and screaming from the player), jumping over or knocking down everything and everyone in your path.  Drop below a fast walking pace (scaled to slope and such) and you die.  Overheat and you die.  Get killed somehow and you die.  You then respawn as an NPC who had line of sight to the death.  \n\nMaybe the spawn sequence would include the character ripping their clothes off and running in their underwear?  And your model acquires scrapes and bruises as they go.  Semirealistic splatter if you fall off a building or get hit by a bus?  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDifferent NPCs would have different stats, too.  Insane guy's heart explodes in front of old lady.  Old lady starts running like she's on fire.  Heart explodes 2 blocks later.\n\nPlayers could seek out specific witness types, like stealing particular vehicles in GTA."
jhnxek,A DnD-type video game where you typically get the worst luck in the most inconvenient times,"Imagine fighting the final boss of an RPG. You have just beat the fifth phase of the final boss and you have one hit left to defeat the boss. Suddenly the 1/5 gamble chance pops up and you have to roll. You have full health and decide to roll. You roll a 1 and lose 90% of your health, get stunned, and the boss kills you and you have to start over.\n\nIt would be funny, because this only happens in the most inconvenient times. However, to counteract the stupid RNG that you would get, if you roll a 1-5 during a boss and die the next turn, that very bad luck is eliminated."
jhnpda,A semi-comedic play the lowliest RTS character game...,"I was just thinking of a game set in a RTS fantasy universe similar to Warcraft but you begin play as a guy who just popped into existence and is being yelled at to hurry up and collect wood for the town before ""the Dark One"" comes to kill you all!\n\nYou get a lumber axe and are pushed out the door to find wood. This part is more of an adventure game where you have to fight wolves and goblins with your axe and try to carry wood back to town, putting the wood down to fight now and then. \n\nSomeone in the field notices how good you are at fighting and is about to promote you but then suddenly you are turned into a cook and have to cook for the town's populace including the horses and harpies that come in through the lunch line (so its a meal preperation sort of thing). You get to be a builder and fight again, once again almost getting promoted. \n\nI like the idea of the game breaking you away to do mini games of mundane things like fishing and cooking every time you almost get promoted to a higher type of unit kind of for laughs. Then the thing is to decide if you get further in the game by completing the mini games, eventually fighting enough to get promoted, or both?"
jhnn76,Adding poker to a gacha game.,"The idea is pretty much what the title says, adding texas hold'em poker for premium currency in a gacha game, but I will expllain why I think this is a good idea below.\n\nMost if not all mobile poker games suffer from being play money with no risk. If you watched a game of Zynga poker compared to an online poker game for real money such as on partypoker they would seem like almost completely different games. With no risk there is also no reward, and also no reason to try and play with good strategy.  Removing strategy from poker makes just a game of luck and removes all the fun.\n\nMy idea would solve this problem. If players were playing poker for/with premium currency, they would take it more seriously using more strategy resulting in the game being more fun. \n\nThere is already an element of gambling in gacha games as when you ""pull"" for a character it is a gamble for what you get. I think this mechanic would be popular with the current gacha playing community. \n\n\nOther less important ideas: \nWinning a larger poker tournament could also reward rare characters or items instead of just premium currencey.\n\nI think it would be cool or make sense if the game had a casino motif or theme, but not necessary. \n\nCould have timed events based on diffrent types of poker, such as pot limit ohmah, knockout tournaments. And heads up tournaments. \n\n\nI can also see why this would be a bad/ immoral idea, as many gacha players have addictive personalities and this game could introduce them and get them addicted to poker. At least then they would have a chance to win real money instead of just waifus."

jhgych,A vr game that's like beat the boss,"The game idea is that you can kill your horrible boss using different items (Like beat the boss but unique because its in vr). An example would be killing ""your boss"" by stabbing him in the neck with a pencil. He would respawn and then you could do it again with a different item. You could even make combinations like  fire + metal bar= a bar that brands the boss. I think this idea sounds cool and like a fun experience."

jhf3je,"A game where you literally expand your consciousness in-game by adding new ""panels"" to the hud","You are an alien entity commanding a nanobot size mech that has entered a human body. Youve plugged in to the central nervous system but start off only with 2 basic black and white monitors for the eye vision and some very basic control of the humans motor skills. Once you upgrade you can add other monitors like infrared vision, radar sweep style motion detectors, even ""eyes in the back of your head""! You can even expand the size of different monitors. Periodically the human tries to retake control so you must fight against its erratic movements - adds a fun handicap plus its great for adding high difficulty challenges. \n\nBesides controlling the human occasionally you will have to explore parts of the body in the nanobot such as travel to the bladder to mine a gallstone for minerals for upgrade parts or zoom around an artery dodging white blood cells and destroying virus'. \n\nThink inner-space/anatomy park but you can pimp out a nanobot until its like its a spy plane"

jhc263,RPG/RTS Heist Game (help expand/improve?),"A RPG/RTS point and click heist game - isometric or overhead view with stylized graphics.\n(This game expands on the concept of another game called ""Monaco: what's yours is mine"")\n\nThe player would start the game by creating your own character and then assign points towards specific attributes/skills.\nThe aim would be to recruit other characters (party members) who would have specific roles in each heist, they would also have their own set of attributes (which would give you an advantage and would also have a draw back). Each recruited character could have their own playstyle and would be more helpful in certain heists.\n\nThe player would only be able to recruit specific members at first, depending on your player characters attributes/skills that were picked at the beginning of the game and/or completing specific heists successfully. More skill points are awarded for every completed heist including in-game money. \n\nDuring a heist the player will have an overhead or isometric view of the entire map (like most RTS games) and each character having their own field of view.\nThe player would be able to issue commands to each character and depending what the command is the character will have to pass a skill check based on their skills/attributes (maybe even a minigame for certain commands like hacking)\n\nThe player can also give each character a list of commands before or during the heist that the character will automatically follow which can be interrupted by the player. The player can also have multiple characters carry out commands simultaneously allowing more strategic gameplay.\n\nIf a character fails a skill check or gets caught while being stealthy - it won't be a immediate game over but the difficulty will rise (i.e guards being more aggressive) and the player will have to adapt.\n(Maybe character permadeath - not sure on this one)\n\nThe map will also have a lot of civilian NPC's to add more option to stealth play or take hostage.\n\nDepending on theme you can also have non-human guards (robots?) forcing the player to adjust their playstyle as certain skills like ""intimidate"" would be useless.\n\nAt the end of the heist each character gets a cut (the player receiving the highest cut) - depending on how many characters were used in the heist the easier or harder the heist and the lower or higher the cut. \n\nThis is a very rough idea at this stage - please let me know what you think and how I can improve on the design."
jh81mb,A Crazy Pool Game Which Lets You Control The Cue Ball After It Has Been Hit,"I've played a few mobile mobile bowling games where you can drag left or right to control the spin of the ball after you've thrown it and I think it would be awesome for this mechanic to be expanded upon and used in a pool inspired game.\n\nChose the angle and power to launch the ball with then control the ball from 3rd person (following the cue ball). You can add back/forward/left/right spin while the ball is in motion as well as pressing a button to hop over other balls.\n\nIt would enable you to do some crazy trick shots which would hopefully make the game a ton of fun.\n\nI think it would be best for it to be set on a bigger table with more balls. Maybe 10 or 22 of each colour because otherwise the game would be over too quickly though you could certainly have different modes.\n\nYou could have more extreme single use power-ups which are obtained by potting a particular ball or achieving some other objective. These could include things like laser sights, releasing a shockwave upon impact, speed boost, extra influence for a turn. There could also be defensive powers you use at the end of your turn such as blocking a pocket for a turn, adding an oil slick, temporarily increasing a ball's mass so it can't be hit very far etc. These could be awarded to you if you get a certain number of balls behind to give you a better chance of catching up."
jh7iar,An idea for a GTA game that would most likely never happen.,[deleted]
jh7dq4,A game which actively uses and teaches Sign Language,"I've recently stumbled upon the SmoothTrack app, which allows you to use your phone's camera for head tracking in games. So I've wondered if there exists a game that uses Sign Language heavily.  \n\nAfter one Google search for ""sign language video games"" there's one that has a bit of it - ""Moss"" by Polyarc. But the thing is that the main character - the mouse Quill - communicates with a Player and the Player can't communicate back. I know that's atleast something, but still...  \n\nAnd now I'm curious about developing a game in which you either actively use a sign language to play and progress OR make an app that teaches sign language with added gamification.\n\nMy best bet would be to make something in VR, because not only do VR-headsets have hand-tracking, but also are a whole system filled with entertainment (so people wouldn't have to buy hand-tracking electronics for the sake of one game).  \n\nMy concerns about the development of this game would be:\n\n\- Sensors in VR-headsets are not precise enough for any sign language.\n\n\- Just like there are so many spoken languages, there are also so many sign languages and their dialects. You could first go just with ASL, but not including other languages in a game about accessability is a joke.\n\n\- Sign languages use not only hands, but also face. Because the upper half of the face would be covered with VR-headset, some signs might be hard to perform.  \n\n\- The market for VR is small, compared to PC, consoles and mobile. And it would be even smaller for the people being able to use sign language. Of course, you can develop a game with ""simplified"" controls without using special signs, but that's another thing.  \n\nTo be clear, I don't have any disabilities myself and don't know any sign language. But it would be pretty dope to make a game for the people with accessibility problems."

Damn i'm so excited.\n\nWhat do you think?"
jh4xoa,"An FPS Game that recreates games like COD / Fortnite, but it's just a really big laser tag game, so it's completely child friendly, and no one can complain","It would be made as a realistic ""shooter"" and be PG since there is no blood, ""violence,"" or anything that could be seen as ""jarring"" for a child.\n\nIt can also be the perfect game for working with sound engines and light engines since it's a laser tag. Everything is lit up, or completely dark, so people will be much more reliant on their aim, rather than their damage output, since... there's no damage output other than 1 or 0. ROF would be of much bigger importance here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince it's based on COD, Fortnite, Apex, etc., there will still be a lot that goes into movement mechanics. Something realistic, but still fun. Sliding would be a must since, to reiterate, accuracy is a big thing here. Grenades would not exist, but maybe flashbangs or something similar to limit senses and punish people that rush. \n\nguns would include fast shooters, rather than heavy hitters (as stated above). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA big thing that I really want to see are kits, or operators, or something that would help different playstyles. \n\nthe two I can think of right off the bat would be \n\n\- a character that throws mirrors onto surfaces. The mirrors could bounce light off them onto enemies, but also vice versa, so you put yourself in a slightly more vulnerable position, in order to gain an advantage\n\n\- a guy with a big flashlight that is kind of similar to a shotgun in terms of shooting. it flashes in front of him and gets anyone who's near him, but only if they're close to him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOh, also ammo isn't ""reloaded,"" as much as it is slowly regained. ""guns"" are charged with batteries, rather than bullets (another touch to make reload animations fun, but also child friendly). Different guns take different sizes of batteries, and different batteries are input at different speeds. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf anyone wants to make this game and sell it, you have full permission, since I'm pretty sure I can't sue you over Reddit lmao (not that I'd want to). \n\nOnly thing I ask, is that you send a link to where to buy it when it is made :)\\\n\nas rule 5 says, I'm open to criticism, so let me have it! Any confusions will be answered!"
jh3bbs,A halo game in your own story of your own character,"My idea is a halo game were you create your own character and customize them to your liking and choose what faction of whether covenant, unsc,banished,flood,rebel,or forerunner. You choose what species, gender,race, religion, background all of this you get to choose and what branch of the unsc and what job like you could be a standard marine or an Army Airborne troop and there will be alot of missions in the campaign where the game ramdomizes the mission and sends you in.it would be kind of like multi-player campaign like set up and if you die in this mission you will ether be saved by a medical wether npc or gamer or if you are to injured in a mission but still save able you will get medivact out and would have completed the mission but you possibly will not get to play as this character again for a long time or never. But you could have allies from spartan 3s to army to marine  to grunts to brutes and some of them will be actual players you choose your preferred weapons  if you like big machine guns pick a saw or dismounted turent , a sniper with a sniper rifle , rifleman with an ar,br,or dmr . You can even be a civilian with a job like gun store owner  or cop or firefighter or something like that so then if the city or planet you live on is to be attacked you have different things that you know and you voice your own voice lines if you have a mic you pick the words you want to say and read them aloud and you get a response from the npc and if there are museums you can like break into them and steal ancient vehicles and weaponry like a humvee and a M16 or a Willie's and a M1Grande or a mustang and a 1911 ancient weapons with different things they do compared to the unsc weaponry like when the 1911 runs out of ammo you can use like a one shot knockout hammer or the M16 as a totally inconspicuous briefcase but the best of all of this no  coatings like the new game will have. I hope you liked my idea."
jgw59w,The Epic of Gilgamesh game in the Style of Hades?,"I was randomly listening to some video on yt and gilgamesh came out and I was wondering why there is no game with it?\n\nI am thinking that a game in the style of Hades with Gilgamesh could work really well, also maybe Enkidu could be like a companion in the style of Atreus from GOW?\n\nWhat you guys think? or how do you guys see a game with Gilgamesh? I personally prefer a game with a isometric camera more in the style of Hades rather than a 3rd person game like GOW"
jgveit,Motorcycles,"I've had this idea for a few years now, but up until playing snowrunner i thought 'THATS IT!'.\n\nSo the idea is pretty simple, an open world motorcycle game where you can have any bike from motocross to supermotos or even choppers and superbikes.

jgv2g4,Knee Driver Master - VR,"Driving...Get from point A to B without an accident.  Here's the catch.\n\nYou have to drive with both hands occupied.  That involves moving the controller from hand to hand. Example: One hand cigarettes (with ash and nicotine meter) , the other a sandwich (hunger and mess meter) and One controller strapped to your knee to steer.\n\nAvoid cars, obstacles and pedestrians while controlling your car with a knee.  \n\nOther hand occupiers:  phone, baby battle (with infant in passenger seat), lipstick, radio, egg on a spoon, fog rag, hot coffee, maraca to play along with some mariachi music, badge, newspaper tossing...each with a meter to keep you honest...\n\nI may be a knee master driver BTW ... or am I?"
jguyk3,Race to Space,"2 teams of 3-4 players, wake up on unknown planet. They must walk around and collect and dig for resources, find different material like wood, iron and stuff. The players don't know anything about the planet's size/gravitation/atmosphere, they must find out the physical aspects by themselve with experiments like letting things fall from cliffs. Main goal is to collect resources and build a rocket that can bring all players of a team back to space. First team that reaches space wins! The 2 teams play in the same area, can't beat/kill other players steal or destroy their work progress! It's just a game of time, valuation, experience and a bit of luck!"
jgu6sk,Oregon Trail on a distant world,"You start in a rural outpost on a colonial world and need to gather a group of people, form a caravan, and get to the coast. The world is procedurally generated in certain areas. You can stop for long periods of time, there isn't anything in particular moving you forward. Perhaps a group of raiders is up ahead blocking you and so you need to stock up on weapons/supplies then push forward.\n\nBasically I think Rimworld has caravans but this is the core gameplay."
jgrki5,I need Ideas for my open world first person survival game.,I need ideas for a open world first person survival game. I need to know where and when it happens.   i thought maybe during the dinosaur era or something like that. oceans could also play a major role. idk please give me ideas xD
jgqsxp,Random power game,a game where you had random powers seems like a challenge or fun depending on what you got.It would be like among us as in the round type but then a free for all with mostly medium powers for people but one or two op powers and maybe a weak power depending on the amount of people.Or a very big idea which I know won‚Äôt happen yet where you have to make n account first so you don‚Äôt keep logging off for a good power and then once it‚Äôs confirmed you get to make ur character and get your random power.
jgonpe,Crusader kings but with first/third person elements and expansive city building,"This is going to be insane because I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll have a game this crazy in depth but imagine taking a game like crusader kings and introducing new gameplay mechanics the further you zoom in. For example when you zoom into a city, you get an overview of all its buildings and it turns into a full blown city builder. You can further zoom in and drop yourself into the city (or fast travel from where you are). You can take part of city battles and there could be generated story content based off where in the world you are playing. In essence it becomes a 1st/3rd person open world RPG. Furthermore, the people in the court of your realm who are there can be fully interactable (similar to mount and blade 2).\n\nThe technical capability of such a game would have to be ridiculous and there would be a whole lot of storytelling needed to be done to populate the entire world but the idea of such a game would reach a lot of people and fans of other games."
jgkglp,"Fun, Addictive Mobile Game","Does anybody have any ideas what I could try to make as a fun, addictive, possibly endless mobile game?\n\nI'm hoping to make a game with the same level of addictiveness as temple run, doodlejump, flappy bird - that sort of game. Simple and easy to have a go at, maybe simple to die on, but it makes you want to go again and again.\n\nIdeally it would be suitable for a range of ages, especially teens addicted to their phones!\n\nAny ideas are appreciated."
jgfgag,A murder game similar to Phasmophobia and A Very Organized Thief,"It would be a game very similar to Phasmophobia, only you're investigating the rumoured base of a murderer. It acts the same way, and you must survive and escape. How is it different? Well it's got a twist. Just like in AVOT, after a certain point, you'll get a bit panicked after hearing a car driving up, parking, and someone getting out and entering the house. The killer is home. From that point onwards the player must avoid the killer. The killer is like a normal human, mediocre night vision (only capable of seeing movement), attracted to noise and light. If the killer sees a room's light turn on or off, sees a room with its light on, sees a room with the door open or closed that wasn't originally (randomly at the start some rooms will have their doors and others closed. The player may open or close a door at any point, and if the killer sees a room with the door open when at the game start the door was closed or vice versa with a closed door originally opened, they will investigate), or hears a noise (they will react with more urgency if it's inside), then they will walk to that location and investigate for a few seconds, determining it to be their imagination if they don't find anything. When walking to their destination, the killer can open doors and will always turn on a room's light before investigating said room (giving the player a small amount of time to hide if the killer enters). If at any point the killer sees the player, they will drop everything and give chase, sprinting after the player until the player is killed (the player has 100 health and no regeneration, the killer does 10 damage on hit, and has 2 seconds delay between attacks) or they manage to escape. After the player escapes, the killer will then be on alert and start circling every room inside, then around the house outside, then repeating. Each time the player escapes the killer, the killer will be faster and pursue longer the next chase. What the player's objective is is to find bits of evidence of the murderer's crimes. These take the appearance of manilla folders and undeveloped photos which randomly appear around the house. Upon collecting all of them, the player must then return to the street outside down the driveway to win. There are difficulty settings, with harder difficulties having the killer being faster and more evidence being needed to collect. The game supports VR, multiplayer (up to 4 players just like phasmophobia; no split screen, every player must have their own device to play), LED keyboards (normally the keyboard will glow dim grey, when the killer is near they'll glow faded pink, and when the killer is chasing they'll glow red, everyway else the keyboard glows black) and Steam workshop compatibility for maps."
jg9nis,Game like genshin impact,"My idea for a banger game would be an anime fantasy open-world game where there is only one character (not 5) and there is PVP and competitive gameplay available, there are 2 types one can have, a primary and secondary which u can pick or roll for unique ones. and there are 11 different weapon types and each weapon has a combination of types they work well with and give buffs to, you can roll for these weapons, kind of a gaccha concept, there is no level cap but after a certain point the stat increase that leveling up gives becomes smaller and smaller, as an incentive to keep grinding. if there is a game like this already please let me know but this is my idea for an awesome open-world game"
jg4zx7,Internal Hard drive or External Drives?,"Here's a idea I kind of just came up with. It's more hardware rather then like game idea, But I got this idea from dealing with my game files. Since I game on a laptop (Not High rang, but it works,) There's not a lot of storage. It's like 120gbs of SSD. I have to download games to a portable hard drive/SSD. And I honestly prefer it. Makes gaming a little bit more portable for me. So here's my idea. Picture this your walking through (Name a play you can buy Games in general) and you see a game you want? Cool, you buy it. but here's the twist. Lets say it's a steam copy, IMO I think it's more well known. But instead of just a code it comes with a small hard dive and a code for steam (Or say if origin or Bethesda launchers did this as-well). On the hard drive the game is already installed, Yes this is a little bit more expensive, But on the upside you won't have to worry about running out of storage on your laptop or even if you play on pc and don't want all your games crowding your desktop, Saves on downloads speeds for people with shitty internet and it is really Plug and play in away."
jg4d0u,Game like Phasmophobia but with aliens,"So hear me out. I think it's a great idea to have such a game considering the success of Phasmophobia. Your tasks in this game would bo to investigate possible UFO sightings (like corn fields or country farms idk) and possibly even see the space dudes themselves. There also should be a various amount of different alien species like your typical green lil dudes or the greys or even insectoids. Hell, maybe even some reptilians to spice things up. I also think it should knda resemble the movie Signs (the one with Joaquin Phoenix and Mel Gibson). I mean like the whole atmosphere of a secluded location like a country house where it's only you and couple of friends with you and the feel that you're not alone and you're being watched. You can even have abductions in this game and your goal will be to gain as much evidence as possible and make it out alive. What do you think about this? I've been thinking on this idea for a good while since I first tried playing Phasmophobia and enjoyed it.  Damn, I'm actually surprised to see that there are so few decent horror games that involve aliens and/or abduction by them because this theme seems very popular in the culture of like almost every country. People love unexplainable stuff, like Bigfoot, Chupacabra etc."
jfyk0e,New Game Idea,The game is called Raykid (A huge Inspiration from the Rayman series) is a game about a child who lost his parents at a hospital Incident and is going through levels trying to find the Person who caused it. (May Receive criticism in your option i am fine with your answer :)
jfthpj,Game ideas but with simple 2d art assets.,I've been wanting to make a game for long but art assets always hold me back. Am not good at art but i can manage some minimal pixel art. I need some simple game idea where there isnt much mechanics for lots of art assets..
jfs43e,Open world survival game ‚ÄúPangea‚Äù,I‚Äôve had this idea for 3 years since I first learned about Pangea. For those who don‚Äôt know Pangea was what all the continents where called 240 million years ago before they started to drift apart. I feel like some sort of open world survival game where it‚Äôs the world of Pangea and filled with a bunch of animals that lived during that time in Pangea. The map would have to be massive though because if you‚Äôre making a game with all the continents merged into a super-continent then it makes since that is massive. If any of you think this is a good idea lmk or if you think it would just turn out to be another survival game I understand there‚Äôs plenty of them out there.
jfr590,New game idea Western game set in the frontier in 1870s,More details: My idea is that the intro and tutorial starts out in a civil war battle such as Gettysburg where you character a cavalry soldier fights in. Introduces mechanics and weapons along with characters. Then fast forward to the 1870s your character is stationed on the frontier and then after a Custer‚Äôs Last stand type battle he is the only survivor and wanders aimlessly before being taken in by a pioneer family. After getting back on his feet but wracked with guilt. The character finds out his unit was betrayed and becomes a bounty hunter and proceeds to avenge his fallen comrades and hunt down outlaws. Area of play western frontier California to Texas loosely.

jfh4xk,"A 1:1 scale VR model of Rama, from ""Rendezvous with Rama"" by Arthur C. Clarke","For those who haven't read the book a plot synopsis is [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendezvous_with_Rama), but in short ""Rama"" is a massive alien spacecraft in the style of an [O'Neil Cylinder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O%27Neill_cylinder) which a crew spends the entire story investigating. Clarke provides a very vivid description of the craft and I've always wished I could see it ""for real"". Rama is staggeringly huge, tens of kilometers long, so it should look absolutely insane in VR.\n\nIt doesn't necessarily need to be a ""game"" in the traditional sense, meaning I don't think there needs to be any specific goals to work towards or any particular ""win"" condition, but I do think exploring the environment should be rewarding and capture the same awe and mystery that the book has. \n\nRama's state changed throughout the book - for example at the beginning it was pitch black and everything was frozen, but then later as it began to power up the lights came on, the ocean thawed, and things started happening. I thought it would be cool if the user had some sort of interface that allowed them to set which state they want to explore Rama in so they can visit different parts of the book, if that makes sense. Likewise, I think the user should be able to spawn in key equipment from the book. For example, the entire ""back"" half of the spacecraft was inaccessible to the explorers until one flew over there on a glider-like aircraft called a ""skybike"". In the VR recreation the player should have the ability to spawn in a skybike so they can actually get over there and explore for themselves. Or another example - Rama has a cylindrical ocean and the crew had to jury rig a raft out of spare parts in order to traverse it and check out an ""island"" that was in the middle of it... players should be able to spawn that raft in. \n\nEven though something of this scale sounds daunting, I think it's actually a lot more implementable than it seems. Here's why I think the project is actually doable:\n\n1. Even though Rama is insanely huge large swaths of it is empty, featureless terrain. This should vastly cut down not only the burden on technical resources but also on development time. \n2. A lot of the ship's features are described as relatively blocky/geometric and featureless and should be pretty trivial to model. \n3. The book spells out a lot of hard detail on Rama's specifications, telling you exactly how many km long it is, how deep the ocean is, how high the cliff faces are, etc. There should be enough detail to get the scale and overall layout of the craft pretty much dead on. \n4. A plot point in the book is how everything about the spacecraft ""comes in threes"", ie almost every feature inside the ship is triple redundant. In other words, once you've finished a third of the map you've pretty much finished the entire thing - there are large parts of the ship where you'll be able to just copy it and paste it two more times and you're done. \n5. Despite what I've said above about how everything is spelled out so specifically, the crew in the book only got a chance to explore a small fraction of the ship, which means there's TONS of room left for a developer to come up with their own ideas and add their own personal spin on things. \n\nPotential roadblocks I see:\n\n1. Rendezvous with Rama is a copyrighted work so I have no idea if recreating its primary setting in VR form would be a legal issue. I know that people have gotten away with virtual recreations of other scifi ships though so... idk.\n2. Even though it's largely empty space and even though it's very repetitive the sheer scale of the ship still might be too much for most game engines.... I'll be honest I have no development experience I really don't know. \n3. Even though a lot of the ship's geometry is described as pretty simplistic there are some features described as extremely complex, sometimes complex to the point the human explorer's couldn't full grasp what they were looking at."

jfacrs,Overcooked coffee game,"Overcooked is a fun co-op physics based cooking game. I was thinking of a coffee brewing game similar aspect.\n\nGameplay \n\nThird person like overcooked. Can be played single or multiplayer for both the story and competitive mode.\n\nMechanics \n\nFirst stages will be easy, coffee will be pre grained and you will need to steam milk.\nAs lvl increases, there will be more options such as: choosing types of coffee bean, the quality of roast, types of grinding, different way to steam milk(to make more froth/less froth) to make different types of coffee.\n\nAdding uniqueness \n\nFrom story campaign, player will get to use different tools such as moka pot, French press, aeropress, chemmex, hand grinder and etc. Player can then buy items that suits their play style the best or that gives the most point.\n\nLevel design &amp; more\n\nI am thinking this would be in a story campaign and the end content can be competitive multiplayer. \n\nThanks for reading and feel free to add more ideas you have."
jfa8yg,Competetive FPS,"So the basic idea is a fast paced competetive game with movement mechanics similar to Call of Duty Black Ops 3 and Infinite Warfare. The game would be competetive focused with several modes based around a single moving objective, examples being hardpoint from COD, if youre not familiar with that its point capture but every 60 seconds the point moves to somewhere else. And it would have different characters with abilities, like the specialists in in BO3 and IW or ultimates in Overwatch.\n\nI've writen a google doc outlining what's in the game and most of the ideas for things, I just need help with actually making the thing"
jf6apf,IRON MAN,I got this idea from the psvr exclusive venue iron man and just the newer iron man suits but like a vr game where you can customize your own suit through the story start with like the second suit in the first movie to the nano bots in the newer ones and have weapons that are only shown in the game and fly all over the city going to story objectives. Look the way I explain it makes it sound boring but in my head it looks cool.
jf66dc,Game based on the cave called Hellhole,"A game called Hellhole.\n\nYou and a group of friends are in the middle of the forest. Your friends go in the cave while you stay in the car parked right outside the entrance. The gameplay consists of multiple dream sequences, as your character falls asleep. At the very end, you hear someone calling your name and you wake up.\n\nYour friends' voices echo from the entrance. They call you for help. On their way up, the leader got stuck and lodged himself in between the walls of an extremely tight spot. They failed in pulling him back down and trying again, so you need to go down and pull him up. Enter gameplay, you maneuver yourself through the tight cave walls, going deeper and deeper underground. As you get closer to their voices, you hear soft splashes of water, but shake it off, thinking it's the cave sounds. You're at the last bend. You can hear your friends voice right behind the wall of rock. You push yourself past the wall, flexing your body as you do so. You expect to see your friend smiling at you sheepishly. Instead, you meet face to face with a dead, glossy stare. Your friends faces poke out of the water. They look right through you with their jaws slack. Then, you hear your friends voice call you again. Before you can even think to back up, a hand reaches out from under the water and pulls you in.\n\nEnd.\n\nAlmost everything explained is dialogue. The voices from the cave are heard. The ""friends"" explain what happened. Before the cave gameplay, the dreams in the car sort of foreshadow what's about to happen, but never does directly. \nIt would be a fairly short game, with the intro being a cutscene.\n\nThis idea is based on a daydream I had after watching a video where a bunch of guys explore a tight cave called Hellhole."
jf50gq,"A horror game, that's it","A horror game where nothing happens, it's just a creepy atmosphere.\n\nI could see it being like your in a middle of a open field, it's the middle of the night, there's a broken down car next to you, feeling scared yet, how about we add some ambient sounds, like crickets, or the wrestling of some leafs in a tree. There could be a few small jump scares, like maybe a owl flys by, or something"
jf3ln2,VR God Sim Game,"If anyone remembers the old Black and White game, you are a giant hand and you can create or destroy villages. The people praise or fear you. It was a fantastic little game that the concept would work so well with new VR capabilities.

These will persist, even after the player and the shopkeeper left.\n\nPossible traps could be;\n\nThe door locks itself (only guards can open it) and X amount of guards or dogs are called.\n\nOutside of the walls of the shop are several bombs which will start to countdown once the shopkeeper has been triggered.\n\nA turret is summoned and will fire rockets at the player once spotted. In addition, the door could get locked too.\n\nOn another note... unlike the guards, the shopkeepers will not have a weapon room to go to if they need to reload or somehow loose their weapon.

jen3ok,Core Ideas,I would like to see some more small core ideas that a game would be build around in.\n\nExample: *changing gravity* in **VVVVVV** or *time travel* in **Braid**
jem8fw,Universe Species Simulator (using the kardashev scale),"Hey guys,\n\nI'm a beginner game dev and I'm here to present my idea to you all. I would love to see what you guys think of it, and if anyone is willing to pick up my idea - I really think we could make this game something (really) amazing.\n\n*Concept:*\n\n- Understanding the Kardashev scale \n\nThe kardashev scale basically elaborates to what level a species can harness energy. \n\nLevel 1 - energy of the entire planet \n\nLevel 2 - energy of the entire host star\n\nLevel 3 - energy of multiple stars \n\nLevel 4 - energy of an entire galaxy \n\nLevel 5 - ???\n\nTo compare what humanity is right now (we are level 0.7 out of 4)\n\n\n [Good video on Kardashev scale ](https://youtu.be/rhFK5_Nx9xY)\n\nTo continue, this game uses this concept as a core idea. The entire point of the game is to help your species progress from a type 0 to an eventual type 4 civilization.\n\nIn the beginning, your planet starts off with a specific type of species (could be anything) - but they are at level 0. \n\nYou are assigned a ""habitable"" planet in X solar system, in galaxy Y. \n\nThis planet can have inherent randomly assigned oddities that make it harder for a civilization to progress from a certain level of the scale to another. \n\nSome planets will have it so that your type 0 civilization quickly evolves into a type 0.3, but some other planets maybe more prone to extinction events that cause them to revert to type 0 for example.\n\nThe game has two main scales:\n (1) Species population \n (2) Objective time elapsed since initial type 0 intro.\n\nThe user basically controls the decisions of the species as a whole. This is the part of the game which will require a good level of work to have decent, fun and engaging gameplay. (Think Civ, but for planetary species)\n\nFor example: At *Level 0*: If your planet is more prone to ice ages, you have a few choices: \n\n1) Evolve species to stand the cold better (may take much longer, so time scale increases by a lot)\n\n2) Species travel out and find shelter near much more heated regions of the planet (may have risks of volcanic eruptions, wiping out some population) \n\netc.\n\nAt *Level 1*:\n\n1) Player needs to make sure the species doesn't destroy itself due to war / nuclear conflict\n\n2) Species doesn't ruin home planet on the mission to harness all planetary energy \n\nAt *Level 2*:\n\n1) Player needs to make sure species develops technology that evaporates lethal comets headed towards planet.\n\n2) Player needs to make sure species figures out how to build space travel capable of traveling between stars \n\n3) (aliens maybe now??)\n\nAt *Level 3*:\n\n1) Aliens. Due to growing out onto multiple planets in other solar systems (after figuring out space travel), they have realized that other solar systems have intelligent life - maybe they aren't level 3 yet. They might be level 0.9. \n\nAt this point, the user could decide to introduce themselves to the level 0.9 species - as a result, ruin their evolution and steal their resources - or, they can watch from far and become allies when they develop further (and even help them secretly develop tech!)\n\nAt *Level 4*:\n\n1) Now that the species is able to harness energy from an entire galaxy - and you have somewhat 'beat' the game, you can continue taking over other galaxies if you want. This will be difficult and will require very specific decisions and luck. \n\nI have so many small ideas and details for this game that I could keep going on. \n\nI believe a universal (civ 5/6) type game using this type of scale system would be amazing. There's so many ways it could even be expanded to include an online mode - where you can play with friends and they start in different solar systems / galaxies.\n\nFurthermore, such a game doesn't even require amazing graphics. Just a good gameplay system similar to Civ.\n\nWhat do you all think?\n\nThank you :)"
jdzzcf,A web comic where the readers guess (but actually decide) WHY something happened.,"So the web comic author writes an (episode), and afterward you have the readers all chatting on a forum about it for maybe a week.\n\nThe moderators sift through the chatter and boil down people's speculations as to why stuff happened. They also have to help guide conversations in that direction.\n\nThen the author structures the next issue based on those reasons. The trick is that no one is supposed to know that they're influencing the outcome of the next episode.\n\nThe reasons get noted in a behind-the-scenes log for the author to look back at for reference purposes, but they have to try as hard as they can not to explain the reasons in the comic. At least not right away.\n\nI think it could get very interesting. The author would have control over the main content, so the story could follow a general plot line regardless, but I think fans would go crazy over characters who are engineered to have motives that they can identify with or fantasize about.\n\nI think that it could end up being much more compelling than if the reader simply played god and decided what happened next. Things tend to happen more-or-less straightforwardly in life, but everyone has their own hidden agenda that ends up being the puzzle to be solved.\n\nThere are a lot of ways that it could be done. Moderators could cherrypick the characters to influence based on which characters are most popular. Or, you know, other things could be influenced besides the characters. It could be made so that there is a cliffhanger at the end for the audience to speculate on.\n\nFor example, an earthquake could happen in one volume, then most of the readers guess that maybe it was because they're on a fault line... or they could guess that it's because of an oil drilling operation, or they could guess that it was a meteorite impact, or the apocalypse has begun, or the planet is being torn apart, or who knows what?q\n\nTwo people could be running and not notice, and bump into each other... etc etc...\n\nAlso, reddit might be a good platform for the forum.\n\nWouldn't it be weird if a comic like that got turned into an anime?"

I don‚Äôt need any credit in the game),"I was just vibin and I thought of a cool idea, let me know what you think. Basically, you are trapped in something called the Echo Chamber ans the only way out is to go through the series of rooms and complete the challenges in each room to move on. The rooms are all dark. You can see echos and you rely on that to see.\n\nWhen you see an echo it outlines the thing in red or orange. \n\nTook me like 5 minutes to come up with so leave any suggestions on how it could be improved in the comments if you would like :)"
jdtp7v,Multiplayer racing game like Death Race but with Pickup Trucks,"Each players are assigned a Pickup truck. There are two roles, the driver and the passenger. The driver is the one in control of the car. Avoiding obstacles, traps, other cars and winning the race. So the driver's main focus is solely on the road. Now the back passenger of the pickup truck will be in charge of the weapons and gadgets. They can attack other vehicles to try to slow them down or completely destroy the enemy vehicle and kick them out of the race. The driver can install new weapons on the car by driving over weapon crates on the road. There are also other crates like repair vehicle and traps."

jdk3ag,"Multiplayer game where one player is an evil image editing program, and the other players are layers. The layers can hop around slowly as sprites. The goal of the editor is to delete all the layers, while the goal of the layers is to close the program and the don't save dialog.","The image editing program is nerfed so the editor can't delete an entire layer until most of it is already deleted. Selections can only be 10% of a layer as well. \n\nIt's not a fully featured image editing program, only enough features are in there for a game (i.e. painting obstacles) and for the minimum appearance of looking like an editing program. But has things like a box seelect, lasso select.\n\nThe layers hop really slowly, think of it as 2.5D. The whole layer becomes a rectangular simple character that has a simple twisting animation like a book page.\n\nAt the start of the match, the layers either choose or create a high contrast part of the image to hide in. So the editor starts selecting parts of the layers and deleting them.\n\nThe editor can draw barriers using a paint tool, but only in the image canvas. The layer players can hop faster in the dangerous canvas. However, if the editor draws too much, one of the dead layers can revive as the new one.\n\nThe topmost layer is a 'hero' on their team and has the fastest movement.\n\nThis all seems complicated but it would be 2d sprites and raycasts."

jdft2v,Some thoughts about total number of class abilities,"Mainly considering the MMO action-rpg genre here.    Also, I only play games now with the Steam controller, so that plays into my thinking here. \n\nMy two cents is that I'd like there to be 20 abilities that are for combat purposes - needed to be accessed quickly.   Of those, 12 very quickly accessable, and those I'd consider the primary spec -related spells and abilities - Heals &amp; or class mechanics that are needed highest priority.   Then, the remaining eight, split them down the middle in some sort of category.  For instance, the lesser &amp; greater ""oh $#i7 buttons"" - \n\nAs I said I'm a controller user.   This assessment keeps in mind that FOUR is a nice number because that is the number of my face buttons.   \n\nPast twenty abilities, I think that is all fine and dandy but they should be non-combat abilities.  Things like unique class perks, tricks &amp; whatever else that doesn't need to be a closely accessible hotkey.  \n\nOK that was more than 2c perhaps but those are my thoughts.    What do ya'll think?   Should there be more/less?"
jdfjj7,A military strategy game with civilian targets,"Imagine a game similar to Total War, in that it combines turn-based strategy and resource management with real-time tactical control of battles. Before battles take place, a tactical decision comes in the form of deciding what to do with civilians, with different options carrying their own strategical benefits. And during real-time battles, civilian units can be targeted, and their uncontrolled actions affect the battle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet's say you know an army is approaching one of your cities. You can evacuate civilians to other areas, but this will reduce the economic output of the city. And said civilians will be made vulnerable during their journey to safehouses. In building your cities, you can invest in bunkers and other hiding places for civilians to take refuge within. During the Swedish attack on K√∂penhamn 1658-1660, attacking civilians was an integral part of the invading force strategy - hoping to create enough terror amongst the civilians to force their leaders to surrender the city.  The issue of how to treat civilians has historically not only been an ethical decision but also a strategic choice.  \n\n\nOnce a city is taken, deciding what to do with the survivors would also be an important decision. Taking people as slaves provides resources, but ensures that other cities will be less willing to surrender. Using captured civilians belonging to the enemies as human shields can hurt enemy morale - but will also hurt once reputation. Giving captives full citizens' rights provide less immediate rewards, but some long-term benefits as the increased willingness of others to desert to one's army.  \n\n\nIf one does establish rules to protect civilians, the harshness of these laws are also important. A soldier who rapes a woman within the occupied territory, should he be hanged publically or slapped on the wrist? The first will increase sympathy amongst the occupied, while the later will decrease the risk of uprisings amongst once own tropes.  \n\n\nEthnic tensions would also play a role. Preferably this would take place on a different planet, where real-world ethnicities would not exist. Having been replaced by fictional population groups. Such as people whose skin has been colored gray and hair gold due to living in radiated areas for generation, and people with red eyes and blue skin. So as to make it harder for tasteless gamers to recreate hurtful historical abuses and posting them online (though modders would probably do that eventually).  \n    \nHaving soldiers occupy an area with a different ethnic majority civilian population, can exacerbate existing racial tensions. Which may feed revolutionary sentiment. When France sent black soldiers to control some occupied territories in Germany during the 1920s, a huge outpour of Swedish women protested against what they labelled ""negro-terror"" ([https://tobiashubinette.wordpress.com/2020/05/05/kvinnor-rasism-antirasism-feminism-elin-wagner/](https://tobiashubinette.wordpress.com/2020/05/05/kvinnor-rasism-antirasism-feminism-elin-wagner/)). If your country is ethnically homogenous, fostering chauvinistic attitudes might help defenses against foreign armies - increasing the likelihood that tropes from other nations will be rebelled against. But such attitudes increase the difficulty of establishing empire-building and tourism. Minority groups within ethnically chauvinistic regions will also face sporadic violence and harassment, in the form of lynchings and the like - with hurts the nation's level of law and order. As national research, one can invest in jingoistic propaganda and racial pseudoscience - or in community building across ethnic divisions.   \n\n\nThe treatment of civilians can also be differentiated based on ethnic and religious lines. During part of the Islamic slave trade, only non-muslims were allowed to be taken as slaves in slave raids. And at other times all black prisoners of war, regardless of religion, were allowed to be taken as slaves ([Azumah, John Allembillah (2014/10) ‚ÄúThe Legacy of Arab-Islam¬†in Africa: A Quest for Inter-religious Dialogue‚Äù Simon¬†and¬†Schuster](https://books.google.se/books?id=IB29DwAAQBAJ&amp;hl=sv)). Similar decisions could be taken to create highly discriminatory societies, or one can choose to be colorblind yet still cruel (treating everyone like crap, no matter what)."
jdclf7,"A story-driven game about the war between light and darkness and balance, except it's more complicated than that.","Allow me to elaborate:\n\nFor Millenia, the world has been locked in a war betwen light and darkness, a cruel war that has been locked in a stalemate, a ying-yang kind of thing (for the lack of better comparison), propagated as ""balance"".\n\nBut one day, a mysterious third faction pops up, seemingly advocates of chaos, who have thwarted plans of the leader of the Light faction before, but where ultimate√∂y defeated. Except, that is a white lie (see what I did there? No? OK), and it's more complicated than that. You see, the Light faction is lead by a warmongerer, who sees this war as the only way to keep balance, and the third faction, branded as advocates of chaos, where a rebel faction that was against this war.\n\nThe former two leaders of these factions engaged in combat, but killed each other, but a rebel and a group of followers betrayed the rebel faction, giving the other faction an advantage, and ultimately decimated the rebel faction, with the exception of a few who went into hiding.\n\nThe successor of the killed Light faction's leader then created an incident that lead to said eternal war. \n\nThe Darkness faction isn't innocent by any means, though. Tensions were high before said ""incident"", and the Darkness faction did engage in several immoral acts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt boils down to:\n\n\- There's light, there's darkness, and then there's you.\n\n\- One faction wants to keep the war going, one faction wants to decide the war in their favor, and one wants to end it alltogether.\n\n\- ""Good"" and ""Bad"" are relative. It comes down to the goal they follow.\n\n\- All factions can be reasoned with, but it depends on your standing with them.\n\n\- A balance mechanic, which influences your standing with factions, and/or vice-versa. The balance also influences whether one faction can move forward and capture strategically important locations (see below).\n\n\- Factions WILL react to things you do. This may result in either missions simply not being available, helping you, or trying to kill you on sight.\n\n\- The game takes place on an eternal battlefield, though there are empty spaces without any battle going on.\n\n\- For simplicity sake, and to drive the story more forward, each faction's bases and/or missions take place on strategically important locations.\n\n\- Potential main missions depend on standing/balance. There are more potential main missions than the ones you actually play, because it highly depends on where you stand. Also potential missions that lead to your betrayal of a faction, should your standing be low enough.\n\n\- Important/High ranking (potential) mission givers also serve as bosses. Who you have to face depends on mission and standing with faction. Potential betrayal WILL lead to a boss fight.\n\n\- Most side missions are always available, though.\n\n\- To sum it up: Mission -&gt; Balance -&gt; Faction standing -&gt; Faction can move forward (or not) -&gt; potential ending.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI put this under ""AAA"" because this would probably require a big team and budget."

jd0ebv,What ever happened to original story telling? Conversations.,"Original doesn't have to be original but have a story that's unique and not boring as the stories and concepts are nowadays in this SubReddit. What happened to putting passion in your project that you didn't need to ask for a plot - most amazing and classing games had faith and hard work put in them, they had care to it that it stood out as it's own unique things. Now it's all boring light-hearted plots that is so boring and dull that it never ends up happening.\n\nWe need darker stories, light stories, but making a story about plat form games are now... Something. What ever happened to actually making a horror game with care instead of horror games now, the rabid whole horror games back then is gone. Actually make a character, make a unique atmosphere, story driven. Nothings a dark souls like or anything like that. Even plain generic stories could be awesome if you cared about them, as a person who had a few stories that I made 5-6 years ago I can say they all are good to go but not generic. Sometimes you have to not be so blatant and not ask for stuff and make a story you have to have the responsibility to care for &amp; make yourself with a bit of love. Put dark and must up stories to it, it will make it more bare-able and more rabid and absolute enjoyment into it."

jcvqe8,"Lifedecking, but with drawing instead of Milling","A card game idea. \n\nSo one of the ‚Äúdeadly sins‚Äù of collectable card games is lifedecking, where when you take damage, you put cards into the graveyard or discard pile. Players hate this because its demoralizing to see your cards become basically unplayable and out of reach. \n\nNow, how about instead of putting the cards in the graveyard, you put them into your hand. \n\nNow, I know in most card games this would just be way too much card advantage, so you‚Äôd still need to balance the game around it, most likely by weeding out easy infinite combos and having a costing system thats hard to get around, so that the advantage turns more into card selection. You now have to decide if a small amount of damage in the early game is worth it to kill the opponent fast or to build up your forces for one big attack, but by doing so allowing your opponents to do the same."

Here you can socialise with players, shop, etc.  It will have an in game currency where you can buy it through micro transactions, or earn it in game through killing npc enemies, helping out npcs and doing little quests that work across servers.\n\nNow in servers everything you find and build in those servers will stay only in that server.  But the in game currency can be used either in community hosted servers (eg server shops) or in the lobby where you can buy skins for clothing, guns, vehicles etc.  There would be base skins that the game starts off with but the community can make and design their own buy using the in game currency to make it.  Designing your own shirt would cost say 100 currency, but you can use say 10000 to open a shop and sell your skins.  When buying in bulk they would cost maybe 20-70 currency depending on quantities.  This will mean there will be a community based skin system where players can actually make more currency and have their own shops.\n\nMore in terms of actual gameplay, I like the idea of having a good vehicle system, upgrading the suspension, putting a turbo in your car etc but having it like car mechanic simulator.  Making custom mods for guns stuff like that.  The map could start off on the smaller side, then over the updates expand it based on what the community wants added to the map.  Graphics I dont think would have to be the best.\n\nStill have to work it all out a bit more but feedback would be awesome.  If this gets some positive feedback I will make a discord server to share the ideas and get a small community together."
jcrzpx,Classic CoD feeling FPS to try and grab as many people as possible,"The idea of the game is that a game like classic CoD (CoD4-BO2) hasn‚Äôt been made in a while for consoles; this game is meant to appeal that. It would run on a simple engine like UE4 or Source, fine tuned to allow for fluent movement and weapon control. The graphics would purposely be simplistic (i picture something like the Forge maps in Halo 5 with team colors and everything, although something like Valorant could also work) in order to have as many people as possible run it. Fast paced, arcadey combat with fluent controls. There would be a league play/competitive mode and a casual playlist. It would be multiplayer only, either being F2P or no more than $15."
jcrjtn,"A single player VR game with fully voice-acted and motion-captured ""online co-op partners"" each with interesting personal stories that they slowly reveal as you progress through the game.","The game never pretends to be an actual online co-op game. The player knows this is just the framing device for an interesting game where you get to play alongside AI controlled teammates who talk to you and the rest of the team, and subsequently open up about their lives and personal problems while you play together.\n\nYou're all playing a fictitious online co-op game, like a bootleg *Warframe* or *Deep Rock Galactic*, that itself doesn't have a strong plot. Instead, the fictitious game's story only exists as a jumping off point to spark your co-op partners' own events. For example, in the ""game"" your team gets to an item shop and it reminds one of your partners of the time they bought the wrong gift for their loved one. Another game event might lead to everyone having an impromptu dance party.\n\nThe game briefly gives some excuse as to why your microphone isn't working, maybe by having one partner explain to the others they've played with you before and your mic was busted, and everyone accepts it and treats you just as kindly regardless.\n\nEventually some of those personal stories take a dark turn, and you get to help them power through it by simply being there. As a team. Perhaps one partner's story doesn't end so well."
jcqpj1,"Not a full game, just a battle mechanic","If you are making a game where you are punished for being evil, make it so (if you are violent enough) some people/monsters hurt/kill themselves out of fear when you approach. It would incite more peaceful and merciful gameplay because that would be sad."
jcqm4v,"I've got a great idea for a mining tycoon type game, I wish I knew game design","I have a fantastic idea for a mining tycoon game, where you place your buildings, machinery, arrange your facility layouts, build rail connections, and most importantly lay your minecart tracks and build your tunnels. When digging out tunnels and fleshing out the interior, you would be able to upgrade tunnels from unsupported bare rock, to timber supported framed tunnels, up to steel supported framed tunnels, steel ribbed tunnels, then all the way up to concrete cast walls. Not only could you dig linear tunnels, but if the situation called for it, you could dig tall stopes following ore veins, and multi-leveled tunnels with shafts and elevators connecting them. You would be able to build pumping stations to pump out water, air pumps to keep the airflow healthy, power plants to power electric lights, and many more other buildings. The buildings would not just be hollow shells, but you would place and upgrade the machinery inside, expand buildings, etc. The level of control at which you would have would be very in-depth. you would also hire miners, build housing, establish shops, post offices, banks, invite companies to settle in your towns, and create booming mining towns. You would be able to build many mines across the map, and sell your processed ores to buyers. Finance would be a big part of the game, where you have to manage your budget and ensure a profit is being made. You would be able to mine all different types of ores, and the terrain would be procedurally generated, but realistic, set across all terrain types in North America. Gold mining in the Sierra foothills, coal mining in the Appalachians, iron mining in the Great Basin, etc. It would be in an aerial and underground view, such as in the Transport Fever series or Anno 1800. You would be able to go into underground mode when building out tunnels and looking for ore deposits. There would be a fog of war in areas which you have not surveyed, and you would only be able to see in a set area around the tunnels and areas in which you have surveyed. You'd start as a prospecting team, and build up your facilities to a full-blown mining company. It'd be set in the early 1900's, with a vintage aesthetic. The graphical style would be detailed but not overdone, but still maintain healthy detail. I would absolutely love to make this game myself, but I just don't know how. I've tried to learn game design in the past but I just can't grasp it."

jcjwmw,Party-based RPG idea,"Edgy as fuck idea I had while taking a dump, might even work: You create your character, and then you create their sidekick/best friend/love interest. Everything is pretty bread-and-butter, you embark on a basic cookie-cutter RPG little adventure on your mission to beat the cookie-cutter little villain while making little friends along the way.     \nThen things go from Fable to Game of Thrones, when the defeat of the cookie-cutter villain unleashes a hellish abomination, causing your former main character to become the new main villain in the now post apocalyptical scorched world. Now the sidekick is the main character and you must defeat your best friend while trying to save them."
jcjh4b,Procedurally generated visual novel stories,What about a visual novel game where the story and characters are generated by algorithms? I know that stories generation is a pretty popular tool but I think about the stories with visual characters and interactive ways to manipulate the game and the story. So the player could have some kind of unique story every time.

jcaocq,An idea from a dream," FINALLY I DREAMT A GOOD DREAM, okay so it was like this cute videogame vibe but also like this among us vibe. so you would choose 3 characters (i couldnt remember how the 3rd character looked like) and you would play the levels. each level has a different space ship (the inside is like a maze) and instead of running away from imposters you run away from monsters. you also had to fix the ship under 20 minutes, each ship has a master key which you need to access the master door which leads to the driver thing where u can drive the ship once u are done repairing it. there is also a story mode which you can explore this purple forest in this weird planet. i woke up after this"

jc2ztr,LUCID: A Nightmarish Journey,"Think of my idea as something like the Yume Nikki cult classic game, except it has a first-person perspective, more prominent horror gameplay over exploration, light-RPG elements such as classes and a skill tree, and roguelike elements like permanent deaths and infinitely procedurally generated dreams that constantly changes in every playthrough. The game would also be inspired by the popular The Backrooms creepypasta, The Evil Within the video game, and the Inception film. The title for the game would be: ‚Äú**LUCID: A Nightmarish Journey**‚Äù.\n\nInstead of the main menu screen, the game relies on a hub level taking place in your apartment. To start your dream, you must sleep in your bed. Once, if you die in a dream, you will quickly wake up from your deep sleep and your saved progress from the previous playthrough will be erased, though, the unlockables you do previously will be completely permanent and you would write some of the experiences of your previous dreams in their journal, which is in your computer. The apartment can sometimes experience strange events along the way.\n\nThe game will feature a Dungeons &amp; Dragons-type character class system, each with its own unique playstyles and roles. I'm not sure what kind of classes should be in the game, so I'd rather need your ideas and suggestions for some of the classes of my game.\n\nThroughout the dreams, you can collect an unlimited amount of dream essence known as ‚ÄúImagination‚Äù, the game‚Äôs equivalent to currency and experience points, and is usually gained through, mostly from killing monsters and scavenging in lockers and drawers. Imagination is used to purchase weapons and items from the shop, leveling up to increase your stats and unlock new abilities, crafting, upgrading and repairing weapons, and much more. You can also convert some of your Imagination into Memories, which in turn can be used to unlock several perks and special abilities for your next playthrough and to increase your survivability through an intricate progression-based skill tree.\n\nCollecting enough Imagination will sometimes grant a new entry to your journal, primarily entailing the player‚Äôs diary, the dreams itself, and the monster inhabiting it. To progress to the next level, you must find an exit door or an elevator located somewhere in the dream.\n\nEvery dream has a unique location and theme, complete with monsters exclusive to specific locations within the dream. The locations vary from a sewer, subway station, factory, abandoned city, forest, farm, prison, factory, junkyard, hospital, school, neighborhoods, cemetery, office building, carnival funhouse, mall, supermarkets, labs, power plant, mines, post-apocalyptic wastelands, medieval castle, and even a spaceship.\n\nThe game features an extremely diverse variety of all sorts of weird and imaginative monsters you could easily think of, alongside the SCP-Esque horrors lurking in the corners. Every monster will have a unique appearance, mechanic, and a distinctive behavior pattern to face them, meaning that every encounter with a new monster will always be different from the last one.\n\nYou may fight off the dangerous monsters by using several weapons found within the dreams or simply choose to avoid them at all costs as possible in order to not get killed. Certain monsters may possess resistance or weakness towards specific types of attacks inflicted on the weapons you‚Äôre wielding. The weapons you found throughout the game range from simple melee weapons and firearms to exotic dream weapons. \n\nSometimes, throughout your journey, you may find yourself in rudimentary-looking civilizations within the dreams the player currently in, including the construction of settlements and fortifications for the purpose of defending against the monsters, inhabited by several human survivors and friendly dream creatures. They are willing to trade items and weapons for you as well as healing you to full health and curing all of their status ailments at a cost of Imagination.\n\nThe longer you descend through each dream, the more surreal and horrifying the dream has come. The monsters would also become weirder and weirder, unpredictable, and dangerous to fight against. To wake up from a dream, you must either die from a monster or a hazard, though it causes you to lose all of your progress, or find and use a special drug to wake you up from their dream, all while completely saving your progress and all of your collected Imagination.\n\nFeel free to add some suggestions in this thread. I can‚Äôt think of anything else."
j88w81,Buffing Heavies in Fighting Games - Weight Based Variable Hit-Stun,"Now, I know I don't have much experience in fighting games, but the ones I have looked into is that the heavies, or more accurately the Mighty Glacier Archetype, who rely on high defense and low speed, are generally pretty weak or low in terms of tier lists and the metagame, so here's an idea on how to buff them based on real life fighting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA lot of fighting games have variable weight-based knockback from what I've seen (especially platform fighters), where lighter characters are thrown back further and heavier characters less so, so they become food for combo players. How about, along with that, attacks also do less hitsun to heavy characters, because if a small, skinny guy gets hit by the same punch a body builder does, the skiny guy will probably be stunned more, instead of equally like most games that I've seen do. This will make comboing heavier characters a bit more difficult and make them actually feel like defensive characters that utilize prediction more. It might also help heavies since their attacks tend to be slower, so having this will help them land attacks just a bit easier without completely breaking them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOf course, balance is everything here, and if you have weight based variable Hit-stun be as much as it is in real life, it might get too powerful, since that's one of the big reasons why Weight-classes are a thing in boxing and wrestling, but I think its more elegant than super armor or not having it at all. What do you all think of this mechanic?"
j80693,A speedrun game where using glitches is part of the plot.,"When a player speedruns a game, he'll use glitches in the game to get a faster time. These glitches are plot-breaking though so what if there was a game where using glitches to get a faster time was part of the plot?\n\nFor ex: in assassin's creed your character gets into a fulldive vr machine and play the game's game through it, but this time the researchers monitoring your character's performance in the machine will take note of how long it took you to perform the mission. They will also tell you to exploit some the glitches in the simulated world to finish the mission sooner. These glitches will be intentional though on the irl game developers' parts. So the best mission score will be the one when the player fully utilizes the intentional glitches. But if the player can find unintentional glitches, then that will be even better and not break the plot!\n\nAnd then when the character gets out of the machine and does the stuff with the researchers there won't be any intentional glitches, but if the players finds some and utilizes them then the researchers should notice and freak out because they realize they're also in a simulated world. If the speedrunner is good enough and finds enough glitches to bypass entire missions, then he'll finish the game faster than the researchers would expect and  they'll note how something feels wrong like they don't remember you completing such and such mission or something like wow this research project is over way faster than expected....\n\nVery meta."

I have absolutely no  technical knowledge nor the hardware, just an idea, and I‚Äôd love to spark someone‚Äôs lightbulb and work with them! \n\nI‚Äôve got the idea for a relaxing room design game.

j7k4as,What if,"Ok, hear me out. Rival Stars; Horse Racing. Combined with Red Dead 2's free roam and horse controls.\nIts basically for horse lovers that can't get a horse where they're at.\nYou can breed horses and raise them to be what you want.\nLike, you have a ranch and have to maintain the ranch and your horses.\nYou can do what you want, race, barrel race, just find a trail and ride peacefully , stopping a few times for water.\n\nSo Rival Star's racing and breeding combined with RDR2's free roam, feeding, bonding, style, and preferred job.\n Along with some added features, I think that would turn out to be an amazing game.\n\n(This is just me having an idea and frantically searching for a sub that I can put it in.)"
j7if9k,Pike and Shot TDF,"This idea is for a plants vs Zombies like game with 5 lanes of enemies that takes place in the Pike and Shot era of warfare (15-16th century). You play as a mercenary captain who commands a regiment in different conflicts all over Europe. Battles take place like levels of plants vs zombies with swarms of enemies moving towards your line. The player's units occupy a 5 unit tall 4 unit deep section at the left of the screen. The units are purchased between battles and their initial formation set pre battle. However the skill in the game play will be to swap the units around to maximize the right type of fire power for the threats in each lane.\n\nFor example:\n\nArchers are good against lightly armored enemies and have long range\n\nMuskets have a slow reload but do high armor piercing at close range.\n\nPikes slow down enemies allong the length of the pike, unless they enemies are special pike breakers\n\nZweihander break pikes and do massive dammage at close range\n\nPistoleres have multiple shots at close range but take a very long time to reload.\n\nPavise have damage reduction vs ranged attacks \n\nBrezerkers do a lot of dammage at close range, but have low HP.\n\nGrenadiers do AOE dammage at medium range.\n\nThe game will have commands to advance and retreat, as well as a marker indicating how the rest of the battle is doing relative to your regiment. Advancing or retreating will slow the reload process for gunners and archers, but may be necessary to close distance on enemies that outrage you or keep up with the rest of the battle.\n\nIf the player's unit is ahead of the main battle line it will attract more enemies, than if the player is behind the main battle line. The more enemies it defeats, the higher the honor and loot the player gets for success in battle. Honor give the player access to more prestigious battles and loot allows the player to hire more men."
j7hwng,A story driven game about a disease called sickle-cell,"So, searching around on the internet, I have not once seen a game about sickle cell, even though it is a terrible disease to be living with; therefore, I decided to make one, as I have experienced a life with sickle cell. Here me out.\n\nThis game would take the player from a baby to a full grown adult. Throughout the game, you will face troubles in your life, from primary, to high school, and your work place. It would be like playing a visual novel. Okay look, I can't spoil much but I am a very decent programmer. All I would need to make this game come to pass are artists. Let me know if you know any, or if you are one yourself!"
j7h58g,Gravity/The Martian (the movie) (the game) + KSP,"(I just posted and deleted something similar, but made it way better so here goes.)\n\nIn either near-future Earth or an alt-Earth with a massive space program bordering on colonization, something Goes Wrong. About half of everything in space breaks, and Earth is out of contact and fucked enough to not be providing any help to stranded astronauts. \n\nYou play as a stranded astronaut. At first it seems like your job is to get home alive - KSP-stye orbital mechanics and jury-rigged engineering to get yourself into a return capsule and get home like you're starring in Gravity.\n\nBut, in the course of doing this, you learn you're not the only one in this situation. There are about a dozen other surviving people stranded around the solar system, all uniquely written with character and personality and all that, trapped with a few months' supplies but no way of getting home. Your job is to re-purpose what's available to get as many of them back on solid ground as possible.\n\nThe difficulty would come from limited supplies; saving 3-4 people would be relatively easy with a little quick thinking, but there's only so much fuel to scavenge and only so many readily available re-entry capsules. The more people you save, the more efficient you have to be with resources and the crazier you have to be about re-entry pods. Saving *everyone* would be possible (or at least, everyone but yourself), but require a near-perfect planning and efficiency.\n\nThis is where the writing kicks in; early on you might establish radio communications with someone on Mars who's funny and personable, but the resources you'd spend saving them mean not following up on ""3 people here - SOS"" running on loop from the lunar surface. So, you get Really Hard Choices about who you can afford to save, where the budget is how smart you've been and how few mistakes you've made."
j7gpi0,Competitive Naruto Game,"I have had this idea for a long time now so I am dumping it here. Sorry for the bad English I am Austrian\n\nBasic Information (skip if you know Naruto):\n\nIn the Universe of Naruto, Ninjutsu and Genjutsu are special attacks that utilize chakra in order to defeat an enemy. To activate a Jutsu one must use Hand signs that resemble the 12 Chinese Horoscope animals.\nThese Hand signs are the root of my vision for a truly competitive Naruto Game.\n\nBasic Gameplay premise:\nBind every zodiac sign to a specific key on the keyboard.\n\nIf a player wants to execute a specific Jutsu they are only limited by there ability to memorize and execute said Jutsu by pressing the respective Keys in the right order. This ensures following things:\n\nRoom for player Improvement: Since the speed of every attack is only limited by the ability of pressing the right keys in a fast manner players should be able to train this mechanic for a near endless amount of time and still see some improvement\n\nAccessibility: The Jutsus are freely accessible from the get go there is just no way for one to do one specific Jutsu consistently without learning, what specific hand sign combo triggers it, by hard.\n\nVariety: Since the players Jutsu arsenal is purely mental and no Jutus have to be equipped we should see different people use different fighting styles in a 1 v 1 Situation. (This of course only if the Jutsus on each combo level are equally balanced( combo level meaning 1 hand sign - level 1, 2 hand signs - level 2.....12 hand signs -level 12))\n\nAdditional thought:\n\nHow to learn Jutsus:\n\nThe player could learn how to use each jutsu by going around the town and asking NPC's to teach them in a mentor like fashion. The fighting style of a player would then resemble the fighting style of the teacher or teachers if they where to learn from multiple mentors, creating some interesting compositions.\n\nInfusion:\n\nA big part of the Naruto Universe are Ninja gadgets like kunais for example. If gadgets had there own bind one could hold the gadget key and press specific hand signs in order to ""infuse"" the gadget with chakra. I say infuse but think of it more like make the gadget do cool magic shit like in the animes.\n\nTaijutsu (hand to hand combat) could be a more neutral way to attack the enemy but could also be infused as well making some attacks hit harder.\n\nThose are just some of my ideas for a truly competitive Naruto Game. I d be open to brainstorm with you guys in the comment section. Thank you for coming to my ted talk"
j7fv5a,Haven and Hell,"You live in the world of Haven basic open-world MMO with all the basic world-building stuff. Quests with multiple solutions slowly evolving your character thru those decisions. There are PVE and PVP outside of towns guarded areas (the old guards pop in and murder the assailants).\n\nThe hook is when you die you go to Hell. Hell is an awful place filled with demons and other players like you who have been killed. there is no law in hell. and it is filled with junk loot that you can just pick up and start hacking at your enemies. \n\nHell is a mirror copy of Haven in black and white nothing is interactable but you are constrained by the landscape. Instead of woodland creatures, there are horrible demons. \n\nTo get out of hell there are options. If you have been a fairly decent citizen and have strong ties with the church you might try prayer. Your prayer may drop you in a church in Haven or it might put you in purgatory for a short period where you are basically set upon by plague-like shit until youre dropped in the church.  \n\n\nOr you can fight you'll have a score to settle depending on the person you killed and other factors. Settle that score with tounges and the head demon will send you out of the gates with a fresh set of bullshit armor to get you home. Of course, there may be others at the gate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOr you can work your way back to your home location. There you will find a copy of your home that you can not interact with except the bed which once used will drop you in your house."
j7fkb0,"Kerbal Space Program, but it's post-apocalyptic survival metroidvania.","KSP physics, orbital mechanics and part-by-part simulated ships. (So, you're building ships that have fuel consumption and actually dealing with stuff about orbital velocity, transfer windows, heat shields, all of that.)\n\nThen, get rid of the actual space program - no vehicle assembly building, no launch pad, no infinite supply of Kerbals. Instead, the player plays one pilot already aboard a ship somewhere in space. They're in a solar system that had a thriving space program with lots of satellites, mining bases and the like, but Something Bad Happened and now everyone's dead and half the stuff is broke.\n\nGameplay consists of navigating and scavenging, getting new resources and new parts to customize your ship (or build new ones) so that you can go to new places and get new resources and parts. There's a TON of stuff here, but could include:\n\n* Starting without an EVA suit, so until you find something you can dock with that has one, you're stuck with very limited interactions\n* Constantly managing a fuel supply, siphoning leftovers from orbital wreckage\n* Starting with only basic welding tools you can use to duct-tape small things onto your ship, but eventually finding an in-SITU construction platform that you have to get supplies and power to to make more advanced repairs\n* Lacking security clearance to properly board certain stations; you have to either come back when you have clearance, or get creative and smash a hole in the side to get access early while compromising it as a habitat\n* Needing something from the surface of a planet, so you can't get it until you're able to jury-rig a lander/orbiter.\n* Needing something from a planet that would be hard to built a land-and-return craft to... But there's a rocket waiting there fueled up and ready to go. But it's a long ways from the thing on the planet you want. So you need to plan ahead, maybe even dropping supply caches along your route.\n* Requiring radiation shielding and/or radiators for transit nearer the sun.\n\nI'm imagining this as a Hard Game, and one that would be possible to lose. It would be possible to run out of fuel before you get a mining/refinery setup back online. It  would at least be *possible* to break things required for advancement, since there's nothing you can't strap a rocket to and throw into the sun."
j7fi7i,UFO Abduction Game,"I've been toying with this as a broad concept for years.\n\nThe essential premise is that you fly around in a UFO and abduct people, animals and objects.  \nThere aren't a lot of games that really fit the bill and I feel like it's an untapped concept.  \n\n\nMy first thought is that it should be a kind of Stealth Scavenger-hunt. \n\nSo picture Small-Town USA, lots of isolated roads and farms around a small town with a sleepy police department.  \n\n\nYou get a list of objects, animals and people to collect for study and a bunch of tools to do it with.  \n\n\nYour UFO initially might only come with a low-powered tractor beam, suitable for loose objects and small animals. Upgrades increase its power, allowing you to uproot mailboxes and lift cows and cars.  \n\n\nYou can unlock Hypno-Rays to lure humans out of their homes, Lasers to disintegrate evidence, Cloaking Devices to hide in plain sight (for a brief time anyway) and Neuralizers to make humans forget they ever saw you.  \nYou can even abduct people who see you and do things to discredit or mess with their minds so they don't give credible reports of Aliens. (Cue the hilarious ""Probe Human"" button)\n\nI'm thinking each mission basically finishes with a score for how stealthy you were.\n\nFuture missions take into account that score, providing increasing levels of scrutiny from Men In Black, the local Police, UFO-Nuts come to catch a glimpse of you and so on. So if you're not stealthy, it'll make later levels a bit harder.  \n\n\nTo make the missions harder, The Townsfolk live to routines, so if you get tasked to abduct a particular person, you may have to catch them at a particular time of day and in a particular place. For example, the Police Sergeant works in the town center all day and only goes home after dark, and he has to travel down a long winding track to get to his house....  \n\n\nThoughts?"
j7f9av,Ghosts vs Humans PVP game.,"[MIGHT ALREADY EXIST.]\n\nA game similar to Dead By Daylight where there's a team of ghost hunters and you're a ghost. As a ghost, have to mess with the team's equipment (draining batteries, moving things,) without getting caught on a thermal imaging camera. You can't be caught on video if you're staying still, you only become visible when you move.\n\nPoints are awarded to the ghost player by draining batteries and moving furniture, with a proximity bonus multiplier. If a ghost is caught, then the ghost is ""dead"" and is done playing for the round.\n\nPoints are awarded to the hunters for evidence, with a point streak multiplier depending on how many pieces of evidence they recovered. The team with the most points win.\n\nI know this is crude and probably isn't half as complex as some of the posts on this thread, but this was a very spontaneous idea that I wanted to get jotted down before I forgot it."

j75oc5,Online TCG with a social Hub World,"I checked for other posts like this with no luck. \n\nThe idea is to make a hub world for players to meet and challenge each other. When these challenges are made the two challengers can decide to make the game casual or to add an ante for specific cards, cosmetics, etc. This could allow players to socialize between games and maybe even spectate friends.\n\nI thought this idea would be cool if any of the big CCG or TCG companies adopted this. Obviously, this idea would have a terrible time trying to gain an audience if it was a brand new TCG but I think it would be a cool twist on modern CCGs."
j72ohi,16-bit styled beat-em-up with heavy retro gaming references,"the plot:\nmason is an average used game store employee, he loves retro games, and is a loyal worker. BUT THEN... a notorious gang robs his store, and shoots him in a non-vital but still painful area. (not THERE you pervs!) in order to keep his job, and stop the gang's rampant violence, he takes to the streets to stop the gang and get the stolen games back!\n\n\nso, the general presentation is similar to retro city rampage, with a pixel artstyle and heavy 80‚Äôs and 90‚Äôs references, albiet with more of an emphasis on gaming and almost none on the rest of the pop culture spectrum. \nweapon pickups include a star that lets you throw fireballs, a throwing knife, a wooden sword, a long-range whip, and a familiar orange light gun (as well as a super scope parody). \nyou can find a roast turkey by breaking down a wall (complete with mentioning it somehow is still like it was fresh cooked.), \nthere is a store between levels where you can buy upgrades for mason and player two,( like double dragon neon ), discussed next.\nplayer 2 is mason's coworker kevin, based on captain n: the game master's titular hero. the two can also do team attacks with the right weapons, such as using the light gun to shoot a shot at the other guys reflective shield, which then hits enemies with their own shields that would normally need to be knocked out of their hands. \nprogressing throughout the game allows you to unlock arcade machines, allowing you to play minigames such as an asteroids knockoff, a 1-on-1 fighting game starring mason and kevin, and a game inspired by a certain lawsuit-causing game that was the debut of a certain well known plumber. \nalso, a tiger electronic handheld appears as an item that increases attack power for a short time, due to pissing off mason and kevin with how crappy it is.\nthe enemies include an abobo knockoff, r.o.b lookalikes, space invader enemies, wall climbing ninjas with katanas, hammer Wielding turtles (of the teenage mutant variety, sleazeball!), and spear wielding bulldog/pig mutants based on zelda 1s moblins.\n\nthat's all i can think of for now, but you can probably add more in the comments!\n\nalso, please notify me when someone starts a project based on this pitch."
j72a4l,GTA but science,"Right so, here's what I'm thinking. It's a game kinda like GTA, like you do missions, maybe some that involve stealing things or even just helping people, stuff like that. But instead of having weapons or beating people up, you use science to progress in the game. What do I mean by that? Well let's say to keep it simple, you focus on 3 main sciences, Biology, Chemistry, and Physics. You have three characters, each one specializes in one of these sciences, as well as having other skills. Like for example, the one who specializes in Physics is really good at stealth or something like that. And basically, if you're the character who specializes in Physics, you use Physics to do certain parts of the mission. \n\nSay you need to disable an alarm, so you decide to throw an object at it. To do that, the game makes you calculate stuff related to projectile motion to do that, complete with a tutorial on how to calculate it, and when you get the correct answer, they'll of course throw the object. It could also be used in fighting, with you perhaps having to use principles related to momentum to give yourself the upper hand in a fight. \n\nWith Biology, perhaps, in the game, you have the option to have an animal companion, and using Biology, you could selectively breed a companion with the traits that you think are useful. This could also be useful for fighting, since you could use your knowledge of adaptations, or even how cells in your opponent work, to give yourself an advantage.\n\nWith Chemistry, you could create things to say, melt down objects, explode things, or maybe even freeze things if you need to. All of which, you have to do some sort of calculation related to it to do. Say you need something to melt down a metal door, you then have to do a enthalpy equation correctly, to make the thing that will melt down the door. It could also be useful to make the mission easier. Like if the building you have to raid or something, is full of a poisonous gas, you could use Chemistry principles to take away the gas.\n\nIn this game, while a single character can do mission by themselves, there are missions where they're all together. In these cases, and you know, if they're next to eachother, you could use multiple science principles together to solve a puzzle, or defeat an enemy. For example, if the Physics and Biology characters are trying to defeat an enemy, the Physics character uses torque to swing something at the enemy, and then the Biology character uses their knowledge of well, Biology, to hit the enemy's weak points.\n\nWhile this game is technically educational, since the way you'll calculate momentum is actually how you'd calculate it in real life, it's not a full on, in your face educational game, like those math games you'd buy for your kid. And there is some kind of story going on in the background."

j6xsxl,Sky continent open world merchant.,"# An open world in the sky\n\nOpen worlds are usually set on the ground. A more creative setting imo would to make the setting of the world be floating islands in the sky. The main type of travel would be with flying machines. As for the theme, any of the ""punk"" themes would work fine (steampunk, dieselpunk, clockpunk).\n\n# Story\n\n""You are a troublemaker who have had a dream of exploring the world and maybe even chart the ""unknown territories"". You've just saved up enough to buy a flying machine and begin the life as a traveler.""\n\nAnd from there every Island has it's own ""main story"" and side quests. As every island has its own culture and people. There could also be quests that spans several islands. Or some islands where you have to complete the main quest to be allowed to leave.\n\nThe idea is that the story is a picaresque narrative. Picaresque narrative being an episodic style of fiction dealing with the adventures of a rough and dishonest but appealing hero. \n\n# The World\n\nThe World would allow for a lot of different settings. Some Examples are:\n\n* Castles / temples like Laputa from The Castle in the sky.\n* Uncharted Islands of different biomes (snowy, tropical, pine forests, jungles, etc.)\n* Different kinds of cities based on different cultures\n\nThe paths between islands should also have different obstacles that you can upgrade your ship to handle or even exploit. Some examples are:\n\n* ""debris fields"" areas that are filled with dangerous junk ( to pass through unscathed your ship might need a shield.\n* Pirate zones. places where ""sky pirates"" are active (weapons would be used here to defend yourself).\n\n# Vehicles \n\nYour first flying machine is a small transport ship that you upgrade throughout the game. Upgrades like shields, carry capacity or weapons. \n\nYou earn smaller vehicles through main and side quests. Things like:\n\n* a smaller flying machine akin to a plane who are more  maneuverable that the main ship.\n* a jetpack for when you need that vertical maneuverability when exploring an island by foot.\n* Hoverboard/hoverbike for exploring the cities."

j6mcek,Racing in augmented reality,"I enjoyed playing with u/miculprints idea of a Re-Volt like game, but in augmented reality with physical RC cars. I did some research and started to play a bit with my 3D printer and my programming skills and showed my results to my friends. They liked it and encouraged me to implement more fun stuff into it. Today I'm going to present to you what I want to achieve and I want to do this by October 2021.\n\nThe purpose of this post is to see if there are ppl interested in playing such a game and also to collect some ideas. So feel free to PM me.\n\nSo THE r/C car racing game in an augmented reality. The tracks and all the cars you will drive are physical ones, but everything is spiced with a little magic. Visual effects, real life physics combined with hypothetical technologies. Cloaking, EMP, you name it.\n\nCurrent version of the car [https://imgur.com/L7lhuD3](https://imgur.com/L7lhuD3) (I would like to thank to Kris ([https://www.thingiverse.com/kriscubed/designs](https://www.thingiverse.com/kriscubed/designs)) and last but not least to Zalophus ([https://www.thingiverse.com/zalophus/designs](https://www.thingiverse.com/zalophus/designs)) for sharing their design on thingiverse)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlanned mode/weapons:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Cloacking - stealth technology. When activated, we will remove the player's car from the other car's camera feed.\n2. Armor - additional protection against damage\n3. Automatic threat detection system - it will alert the driver when his car is being targeted by oponents\n4. Aim assist - Allows the driver to target distant oponents\n5. Automated targeting system\n6. Perception module - shows additional information about opponents (mods equipped by them, car health etc.)\n7. Shield - protects against speed limitations and emp\n8. U can't touch this - no collision allowed, when activated\n9. Undercover cop - police light will we shown for nearby players and speed limitations apply for their cars\n10. Nitro - for a few seconds it will boost your speed\n11. EMP gun - when you hit a car with this, it will loose it's controls for a few seconds\n12. Flashbang - blind nearby oponents for a few seconds\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTrack mods\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Minefields - passing tru them will damage the cars\n2. Bermuda triangle - if you get inside, you might never get out as your car's controls will be inverted\n3. Drop zone - it will spawn mods that can be equipped by the player\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI will also include a minigame, a 2d Outrun like game, which you can enjoy while you are waiting for a vacant RC car.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEvery suggestion is welcome, I would really like to hear your opinion on this. All the ideas that will be implemented will be compensated by putting your name on the hall of fame and with the eternal gratitude email :)\n\nso if you have ideas for mods and other improvements feel free to send me a PM."

j6k1fm,An mmorpg with intricate group/clan command system for multiple (single)player controlled characters.,"Instead of multi-boxing to control multiple toons, what if you could control a group of toons with auto follow and skill macros, or even the option to set up macros for raid groups in instanced zones? In the hot key bar aside your character's skills, you could have a button that would tell your healer to mend your tank, another button to tell your mage to nuke the tank's targeted mob, and so on. You would still need to level each character individually (or grouped experience). You could also have the option of switching between toons for full control."

Abilities are just placed into a list that can be chosen from.\n\nNote: abilities need to be limited to certain archetypes, and get more restricted as they get more powerful.\n\nExample: all casters can use 'cure' after being unbound. 'Cure 2' can be used by support casters. 'Cure 3' can only be used by caster healers.\n\nExample 2: shield bash comes from a shield. It can be unbound and used by martial classes. 'Shield slam' can only be used by heavy armor classes.\n\n\nNot sure should be MMO or single player.¬†\n\nsingle player would alleviate some balance issues, as less emphasis would be needed to keep things balanced. If players want to be overpowered, why not let them? Potentially a way of balance would be longer cooldowns on non-matching classes? +5/10% per step away from the source class.\n\n-----\nPotential of cosmetic additions to add or change particle effects of items for holidays?\n\nArcher skills get valentine's heart arrows, Halloween pumpkins particle effects for 'fear' effect?\n-----\nPlayer crafted gear could be stronger stat wise, or have more slots, but have (usually) no innate skills\n-----\n\nMain gameplay‚Ä¶ either hack n' slash, or grog adventure.

The skill would change the look of your caracther.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEach time you die, you can keep one skill, and you have bosses hidden, like say on a mountain, but you need the climbing skill or flying skill to access it and other stuff like that, this way, you would seek out skills to explore further and become an unstopable machine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm still thinking about what kind of inventory system and story.

That means you could throw a guard's corpse in  there and go to a security room to open those doors again if you need to.\n\nIn addition, there could be items that could help the player, like a gas mask, long fall boots, parachutes, that kinda stuff.\n\n#Predicting\n\nObviously, the player would have to be able to somewhat predict that there is a deadly trap of death up ahead.\n\nWell, obviously I could task a NPC to talk about it, but it would start getting repititve if there's someone informing you that there is a trap every single time.\n\nBut, as I said in earlier posts... the enemies build the level while you're playing it. Or rather construction worker enemies.\n\nThat's right. They're gonna prepare a trap and you can break it by taking out that one guard with the activation mechanism or something along those lines."

Machined weapons will obviously be scattered about the map for the players to use.\n\n\nDifferent parts of the map could have shops that you could walk into and purchase items like weapons, aid or vehicles, with the Mall giving you the best variety of items to choose from.\n\n\nI also considered a different way of starting the game, rather than jumping from the sky out of a plane (like almost every other battle royale) players could choose a location and pop out of a manhole cover from the ground at that location.\n\n\nAnyone else have any suggestions.\n\nMan I wish I could develop games"

j5z5kk,A Cowboy Samurai game.,"In the game you play as a Native American who has learned the ways and techniques of a cowboy and samurai master and has decided to mix them into his fighting style. The main mission in the story is basically the Cowboy Samurai taking down this big gang(I haven‚Äôt came up with a name for it yet) and some outlaws.If there were to be a sequel i would have it take place in Japan.The game would be a hybrid between a third person shooter and a hack and slash. Similar to RDR2 there would be an sort of deadeye in the game for projectile weapons. For melee there would also be a sort of deadeye except its like the sword slash in anime where the character hits a bunch of people then seconds later they drop down. Speaking of weapons the weapons would be a mix between american and japanese weapons. You can hold up to three weapons primary, secondary, and melee. Each weapon you can customize them the way you want it(except for melee).Some enemies may require you to use your guns while others you will need your sword. \n\n\nWell thats all the ideas i got for this. Feel free to tell me your thoughts in the comments below."
j5xh8k,Puzzle platformer that focuses on climbing a tower and delving into a submerged city.,"The game would have the player seek through the ruins of a skyward reaching tower for a key or devise that would allow them to go under water to search the ruins for a key or devise that will allow them to get higher in the above water ruins and so on and so forth. The player would slowly get upgraded allowing them to stay underwater for longer with the puzzle solving mechanics of Legend of Zelda or Darksiders that reward backtracking once you have the new tools that opens up new areas that have new upgrades.\n\nNo combat, just peaceful puzzle solving and platforming. I've never put much thought into the story of the game. I'd just love to play a game like this or make it myself one day."

It evolved into an idea for a 2D space shooter like starblast.io that featured planets made from the custom resources that could be harvested to upgrade the ship‚Äôs weapons, armor, boosters, and the mining laser in different ways. \n\nLike Tinker‚Äôs Construct, your weapons, armor, etc, have different component parts like a battery, processor, etc that can each be made of a different material. Your ship starts out made of fairly common resources that have good enough stats to hold you down, but collecting different materials will be key to victory. Each material has properties like durability, conductivity, and melting point that determine their viability as different parts, as well as traits that give them special abilities; so a material like titanium would make a better booster frame than one similar to silicon, but silicon might make better heat shield plating or something. Maybe a resource named ‚ÄúThor‚Äù makes batteries that hold lots of power, but ‚Äúarbium‚Äù makes batteries with more efficiency. A ‚Äúdor‚Äù laser core might ignite targets with its special trait, whereas ‚Äúfor‚Äù might freeze enemies solid. A resource‚Äôs rarity determines its maximum stats. \n\nExisting resources like titanium and silicon are predefined, however. That way, you don‚Äôt have scenarios where ‚Äúgold‚Äù is red, a non-metal, and is super common. Random liquids and gases may or may not be a good thing to add, depending if they have enough use for things like fuel or chemical weapons.\n\nThe goal would either be to defeat the AI space pirates if it was single player, or the other players in a multiplayer setting. I guess the AI space pirates would likely appear in multiplayer as well, trying to amass their own materials and become the rulers of the galaxy themselves.\n\nLet me know what you think! I have no idea if such a gimmick is too similar to Tinker‚Äôs for copyright reasons (because you can actually copyright mods, apparently), however; so the resources would likely need some tweaking to make them feel more like their own thing rather than like a bootleg."
j5vmqi,"Battle royale, but you play as kids trick-or-treating on Halloween.","Battle royale, but you play as kids trick-or-treating on Halloween.  \n  \nIve been playing a lot of warzone, so it's similar to that, but all BRs seem to have a cycle of loot/eliminate teams/circle closes.  \n  \nYou ""loot"" houses to get candy. Use candy to buy nerf guns/ammo. Fight other teams with nerf guns to steal their candy. Easily monetizable with different costumes. Map is a town with like 50 blocks of resdiential houses.\n  \nMaybe: if you run out of candy, you're eliminated? Not sure about the specific mechanics but trick-or-treating fits really well with battle royale imo."
j5vh31,Unusual character ideas for a 3D platformer,"Either because of potential mechanics, or just because it's an animal/vehicle that hasn't been featured much in platformers and would be neat to see."
j5ux4y,An open world RPG of early colonial australia,"Something like a red dead game set in the ballarat gold-rush or some game where you explore partially colonised australia. I was thinking a game while set in the ballarat gold rush, has bush living, maybe being a bush ranger. SOmething that has historical elements of historical colonial australia and of pre-colonial australia, maybe having small parts of the game be legitimate explanations for current place-names, places etc. Could have a language element? Maybe travelling parties of first nations people who you can learn from and trade with but must learn the language to communicate? Red Dead redemption but in australia?"
j5s08n,"a survival game, in which you are in a forest at the edge of the streets alone after the character's father leaves to get gas for the car but does not return","the game would be 3D, it would have graphics like the ones from the nitendo 64 era, it would be in the first person, the enemies would be animals and forest monsters, the purpose of the game is to find your father or escape from the forest, without complex dialogue, and it would have a crafting system in which you find tools in the car or outside, stones and branches and combine them into weapons, or you find them."
j5naj2,Game with multiple beginnings where starting a game will give you a random character. Death playing that character is permanent but consequences of their actions as well.,"I know, this would be like Octopath traveller but the idea is when you start a game, you'll thrown with a random character with random stats to work with. The game will have the same story objective regardless of your character. The twist though is that the character you played will be part of the world of the next character you play as (effects of their actions will be permanent in the world). This will go on until you finish the game or run out of characters (number of characters is predetermined and will have different stats and storyline).\n\nWhat do you think? When I thought about it at first, I really think it's complicated."
j5mlbr,RTS Faction Creep Hive,This is an idea for a RTS faction similar to the Zerg. Instead of spawning units that can freely move about the map this faction must grow tendrils out from its core hive to wherever it wants to exert influence. Growing these tendrils will have a minor resource cost and require a conscious decision by the player as to where these tendrils will go. \n\nAll the player's resource and fighting units must travel along these tendrils. If the tendrils connecting back to the main hive gets severed all units on the disconnected side go idle and don't defend themselves. If a connection back to the hive is restored the units reactivate. \n\nBalance wise this faction's units would probably have to be faster and tougher than the other factions to make up for the tactical limitations of imposed on the tendrils. Perhaps this faction will need an air or water unit that allows it to establish a 2ndary tendril hub separate from the central hive.
j5icel,A game about someone who can't feel pain,"Not sure if a game like this already exists but I'll take my shot.\n\nA game about a hero who doesn't flinch when struck but takes damage nonetheless. Well I think that's pretty much any game with a bad physics but here's the gist, you don't have a life bar. All you have are visual cues. You can enter a place with poisonous mist that should make your skin feel hot but your character will just stand oblivious of the damage his currently taking. Something akin to that, it's interesting how a game with that premise will be made. And to see you character dying without you knowing the cause unless you're paying attention and you just neglected to do the appropriate measures to solve the problem. \n\nAlso, if this will be a game with combat involved, a guy who can't feel pain would rip/damage his own arms and strike so hard he wouldn't even know if he has caused damage to himself (strike with more damage but with the repurcussion that you might cause damage to yourself) and you won't know if it's already too late because suddenly you can't even hold your own sword (something like that). I know this is all vague and I am just interested with that kind of mechanic. Because you as a player don't really feel the pain and it would be interesting to see you take care of your character, lol."

j5dvrw,A sandbox game with completely foreign physics. Objects get lighter when wet. An object's momentum is dependent on how hot it is. Gravity is object-dependent rather than world-dependent. Nothing makes sense... and yet with player experimentation it can.,"This is a game about exploration. But instead of exploring a world or its history like Breath of the Wild or Outer Wilds, the thing you are exploring is new physics itself. The game world behaves unlike anything we're used to... and it's all unnamed, uncategorized, undocumented and unestablished.\n\nThe promise is that the player could get the feeling Isaac Newton had when he realized the actual nature of gravity."
j5dltx,Horror game in the woods. Any ideas?,"Looking to create a small horror game in the woods/near a farmhouse. Game won‚Äôt be too long, so was thinking something like slender type objectives. Any cool ideas?"
j5crs7,A game where a human model is running towards you.,"So hear me out this, this game was inspired by the scene in ‚ÄúGet Out‚Äù where that one guy was sprinting towards the camera in a very menacingly pace. \n\nThe Plot of the game is just that idea. However, it‚Äôs sort of a psychological terror game. In the beginning the human model is very far away and he just looks like a dot. You have a gun that can only be loaded with one bullet at a time and reloading is fairly fast. As the game progress the dot is getting bigger and he‚Äôs running towards you but when you aim at him he‚Äôs doing anything to his physical power NOT TO TOUCH YOUR CURSOR or be in your line of sight. What makes the game even more frightening is that the sensitivity is locked, but he‚Äôs just avoiding your line of sight in a normal human way, he‚Äôs just very acrobatic. \n\nTo add a little bit of suspense, when‚Äôs he‚Äôs just the tiny dot. There‚Äôs music playing in the background that‚Äôs probably too high pitch for some people to here. But as he approaches the decibels get lower and lower AND LOWER UNTIL ITS JUST THE THX NOISE!\n\nNow to add a surprise factor. Sense this man is absolutely hard to shoot, once you shoot him! He hurls over and seems like he‚Äôs dead, but then he positions himself into a track starting pose and SPRINTS TOWARDS YOU! NOW HE REALLY WANTS TO KILL YOU. \n\nNow for the scare factor, there is no pop up or anything it‚Äôs all reliant on the suspense and Music of the game. Once he captures you it just restarts without you knowing and the music starts again as he approaches you. \n\nNow if you win, from shooting him a second time your character looks at his gun and cries, because you just killed an innocent man. You look back at the body and it‚Äôs gone. And the game restarts all over again\n\nThis Game could be an open workshop so you can add your own movement and skin towards the human model. And your own gun but it can only be loaded with one ammo/bullet. \n\nI‚Äôll gladly take all the criticism because I just wanted to get this out of my head and save it for later when I have the talent to make this."

j5aag0,Galactic Havoc: A 8 player team game,"Galactic havoc will be a 8 player team game centered around fighting against a alien armada on a foreign planet. \n\nThe game is top down perspective with the player being able to point vertically, horizontally and diagonally \n\nEach player will be a choose a class that determines weapons, equipment and buildables, such as Strikers that will have stim packs to move very quickly and Gunners which can carry a ammo pack to refill the teams ammo supply.\n\nEach class has specific buildables that they can place to aid in the fight for example engineers can place a slow shooting sentry gun and the medic which can place a healing beacon to heal teammates. they can be destroyed and only 1 can be built at a time unfortunately so be smart on where you place  towers. \n\nThe Game will have 2 main game modes: Operations, Attack and Defend.\n\nIn Defend, the main objective is to defend a certain area or building by fending off a set amount waves of aliens before fighting a boss in the end. \n\nIn Attack, The Team take the fight to the aliens by fighting through randomly generated Caves, spaceships and cities."
j5a4po,VR Cave Explorer,"Dark VR games are great and intense in my opinion. I really like games that have dark areas that require a flashlight to see (like some areas in Half Life Alyx). I would love a game that takes this idea and implements it further. \n\nTraversing a pitch-black cave in VR would be pretty intense. I think it would be interesting to only be able to see what your flashlight allows. Maybe the game could allow you to find items such as flares, flashlight batteries, a head mounted helmet flashlight, etc. Wielding a pistol in one hand and a flashlight in the other creates for some exciting combat experiences imo.\n\nThis idea could also create a good roguelike. Maybe the the cave you traverse could be randomized. You could find shrines with different items/perks. And the items you find (flares, batteries, ammo, etc) would be randomized."
j56l42,Idea time: Knifefighter Online (VR),"The basic idea is that you and an opponent are in a somewhat small arena with the choice of one or two knives to wield. You can only use knives because it would be the easiest to use and there wouldn't be much balance that has to be done. You can fight someone online or locally and you have to hit someone's weak points with lots of momentum to deal max damage. You can control where your weak points are, which adds some strategy to where you have to hit. Your attacks will land in your opponent and won't move anywhere until you get it out of their body. That is all right now.\n\nTL;DR, you use VR controllers as knives to attack someone's weak points."

j53v68,"Game where going back to previous saves changes the most recent/main ""save"".","Perhaps a 3D platform puzzle game where you have to move ladders/blocks to different locations across multiple saves in order to progress. Or possibly something more abstract with complete changes in environment. Maybe even an RPG where you need to go back and rescue different characters in specific moments to advance the story.\nOf course, there will have to be a weird system in order to track saves successfully. An overarching global save that ""saves"" your other ""saves"" individually while creating a separate slot for the save with the most progression. \nUnsure if this has been done before, or if it could even be executed thoroughly enough to be a full game."
j53mlh,Game where you drive through BLM protestors in big trucks,"I might even make this with my limited Unity knowledge. So you get a car or truck, and you choose the protestor type (blm, antifa, anti Trump and whatnot) and you start on a street with a massive group of protesters in the street. They act like typical zombies (running towards you and when they get close enough to your car they start bashing it with skateboards and bicycles). You drive through them with cars and trucks going fast or slow. When they get hit it activates ragdoll physics. You can get points for more protesters hit. If you are in the POV camera mode then you get a gun. If the protesters are too close to the truck for too long they will pull the door open and you will start taking damage. If you fire the handgun they all run away from you. From there it becomes a first person shooter if you want, or you can drive away. The goal is to reach the end of the road, marked by flag or line. The protesters can get more and more violent as you progress through the game. You can customize your truck with Trump 2020 flags and American Flags. Maybe a multi-player mode could be added too. \n\nI think this is a great idea for a game and I might make it myself. I know how to use unity and have made several games in the past but I would have a lot to learn if I wanted to add everything here. \n\nThe idea came to me after seeing BLM attacking a truck that was trying to drive down the highway. They shouldn't have been in the highway to begin with. They acted JUST LIKE zombies in a typical zombie game. \n\nI absolutely love this idea."
j53ht7,An MMA RPG where you not only create your character's stats but learn and collect moves from several different fighting styles,"So I've recently been getting back into my previous passion of practicing martial arts and self defense so once I got this idea my mind has been racing. \n\nI had an idea for this 3D fighting game (I'm thinking the art style should be 32 bit to keep it simple) that is grounded in reality for the moves, so no fireballs or teleports or such. When you create a male or female character (mixed fights will be available) you'll be able to set your character's stats:\nStrength determines power on your attacks\nEndurance determines your max health and limb health\nSpeed not only determines how fast you sidestep or dash, but also how fast your moves can come out, including blocking.\nDexterity will decrease the time needed to parry as well as be the main stat needed for training more difficult moves and styles.\n\nBut the main star of the game will be the fighting styles. You can choose to spend points both when you start a character and when you level up for ""experience"" in a fighting style or even multiple fighting styles. As you learn more from an art you retain more of that styles moves and combos. Theoreticallyno move should conflict with another but you can always ""deselect"" moves you learned and have no intention of using. This way you can either stick to one style or make a combination from many arts to form your own style! The fighting styles to choose from, there's boxing, kickboxing, karate, Taekwondo, Muay Thai, Judo, and i would like some ""out there"" styles like Keysi and Kali. Each style has their own strengths and weaknesses. Keep in mind that even though its an RPG, it is a fighting focused game, not a stats focused game. You still need to know how to utilize your moves effectively.\n\nWhile the game is story/single player focused, there's an arena mode where you can fight other players, with other players watching similar to Mortal Kombat's King of the Hill mode.\n\n\n\nOTHER NOTES:\nThe story will be more about underground fighting. You can also choose what story you want with the ""What do you fight for?"" Setting when developing a character, with those options being: For respect, For Love, For Revenge.\nThere are a lot of characters to talk to, not all of them fighters. And you can improve or diminish your standing with them by talking, doing certain tasks, or fulfilling requirements in fights. Your relationships will determine the branching paths of the story, which will lead to different endings. Also characters you might think are good in one type of story like ""For Respect"" might be different in another type of story like ""For Revenge""."
j52pe9,"Die Hard, with elements of Among Us, Tarkov, and Payday","The main map is Nakatomi Plaza, a skyscraper with several floors.\n\nAll players but one are terrorists. Their job is to complete several tasks around the map to complete their heist. The other player is John McClain (the saboteur), who spawns randomly on the map. Their job is to kill all the terrorists, or make conditions that allow the police to overrun them.\n\nThere are enough tasks around the map that naturally the terrorists will need to split into groups. The two most important tasks are maintenance: control intermittent SWAT attacks on the bottom floors (SWAT are bots), and guard the hostages. The terrorists are on a soft time limit to complete their tasks -- the bot waves attack intermittently and start small, but become more aggressive and plentiful as time passes. Eventually, this will require more resources from the terrorists and eventually overrun them. Bot aggression spikes prematurely if the hostages are freed by the saboteur, so guarding them is mission critical.\n\nThe saboteur will lose most engagements that aren't an ambush 1v1 or (possibly) 1v2. Their main advantage is mobility: they can hop between floors and rooms very quickly using rappel and vents, while terrorists are stuck with stairs and elevators. A large group of terrorists jumping from task-to-task is a bad fight for the saboteur, but they can break up these groups by hopping between floors and creating distractions that require the group to split up into two or more areas (ala Among Us and o2 sabotage.) For example, they can fuck with the bomb on the roof, reactivate power to the safe, sabotage the escape vehicle, etc. If the terrorists do not split up to deal with these new tasks, they will be so bogged that they will not have time to finish everything before the bots start to overwhelm. However, the saboteur needs to be careful of where they sabotage! Some sabotage tasks take more time than others, and some rooms have cameras that will notify terrorists of your location after a certain amount of time. Getting caught in the process of sabotaging puts McClain in a very bad position because they will probably lose against a coordinated ambush.  \n\nFor terrorists to win, they need consistent coordination between groups and clever management of their resources. Chasing the saboteur is a strategy, but not necessarily viable if the saboteur is good at using their mobility to escape detection.\n\nFor McClain to win, they need to pick engagements wisely and gather intel about where the terrorists are (and where they will likely go next). Surviving the early game is challenging because of your bad starting loadout and small bot distractions, but if you aggressively divert or even ambush terrorists at the right times you will snowball into victory.\n\nFull games take approximately 20-30 minutes."

j4xglt,"Battle Royale Night Edition, With elements of survival (Zombies)","So, I have this idea for quite awhile now, but haven't posted it since I needed to iron out all of its details until it's fairly complete. It's not going to be a short post so just bear with me here.\nI've been playing the BR genre for some time now, and while I'm not a huge fan (playing MOBAS mostly) I do have a couple dozen hours or so on PUBG (I don't play fortnite, never really gotten into it)\n\nOne thing is missing in my opinion, in the genre, and I realized what it was, at least for me. The thrill and excitement of the first time that you're playing a battle royale, quickly changes into just competition as you play it more often. And while by itself it isn't really a bad thing, I do believe that I takes away a big chunk of the experience and simply turns it into an almost tedious task, which makes it hard for any BR game with maintaining a stable player count without the players ditching for other games.\nAnd so here's my idea. A BR game that should get your blood pumping and your heart racing more than once, or twice. Each play through should feel unique, and here's how.\n\nPLOT:\n\nThe game has a light plot (or story) behind it. The year is 2046, the entire population of the world got infected in a virus that basically turned majority of the population into zombies. If that is not enough, the planet's rotation had extremely slown down, leaving half the planet in an almost eternal darkness, and limited resources. Earth Is no longer a suitable place to live on.\nSome people discovered that they are in fact immune to the virus, and therefore now have to fend for themselves amidst all the chaos. Other than those, a special unit of police forces was kept alive as well (using special equipment that allows them to survive, like gas masks), in order to try and prevent the remaining civilians from killing each other while trying to get resources in every way possible, including killing, which leads me to the two classes the game has:\n \nCLASS SYSTEM: AUTHORITY VS REBELLION\n\nLike I just mentioned, the game will be divided into two groups, in which players will be able to engage in. The first group will be the rebellion, these are the citizens who stayed alive, are armed, and ready to go hunting and scavenging for supplies.\nThe second group will be the authority, which as you already guessed, the police task force that was sent to eliminate the rebellion. However, the Authority can turn on each other and they don't have to follow some code of friendly fire, this is the end of the world after all, meaning that teams and players from the Authority WILL have to face other teams from their side and vice versa.  Please note that while it sounds like Authority will have the advantage in terms of weapons and technology, the game is meant to be balanced enough to a point where it won't matter which role you'll end up getting, and the differences between the two classes will only include slight advantages in both ways.\nThe game will allow a single player team and up to 4.\nIn order to create an organic gameplay, players (or teams) won't be parachuted into the map, but instead will be randomly placed and scattered on it in various locations, in order to prevent rushing to the same spots and locations right at the get go. Let's talk about the map shall we?\n \nMAP AND ENVIORONMENT:\n \nThis is basically the core of the game, and the most important aspect of it as well. The map size will be around 10x10 square kilometers, and will be consisting mostly of a large city in the middle, a sprawling urban area with lots of buildings and a suburb area, all being either abandoned or swarming with zombies. Around the city there will be some open areas with a lake, a river and some tiny villages here and there. The time of the day, as you guessed it, will be at night. But it won't just be a night as it appears in most games ‚Äì I'm talking about an almost pitch-black night, with only the light from the moon, your flashlight or a working streetlight guiding your way. Most of the city is under complete darkness, some streetlights are working here and there, but players will be able to shoot them and decrease the visibility in that area. Imagine being chased by a rebel, you both running in the street and he's after you. finally you reach a dead end and have nowhere to go. You realize you're in a light zone area, you shoot the nearest streetlamp and it all goes dark. Suddenly you have the advantage, you hide behind a car and surprise that motherfucker with a rail of bullets to the neck. The idea of darkness has a big impact on how the game will play, since there are other entities in the world other than rebels and Authority ‚Äì and I'm talking about the zombies.\nThe zombies themselves can be attracted to players both by hearing them or seeing their light emitting sources (flashlights, laser targeting devices etc) so it won't be too wise to just open fire at every occasion you have, because it'll draw a lot of unwanted attention, from both players and zombies. It basically means that if you enter a building, and find a good spot to snipe someone, you should take into consideration that there might be a passing zombie horde down in the street, and your shot might give them an excuse to enter and check out the building when you're in it, leaving you the choice to either jump for it or try to fight your way down the halls, killing everyone in your way. Imagine how scary it can be to enter a nice lonely suburb house, search for some ammo, and have a zombie charge at you from one of the dark rooms, and you have to fight that fucker or make a run for it. Without knowing what can be hiding right across the street, right across that room or just a floor above you in the same building,  players will stay on their feet the entire playthrough or until they die. The game won't feature an active map (in the corner of the screen), so it means that if one of your team members lost his way while searching for stuff, the entire team will have to help him getting back together or try to save him if he gets caught, based on environment description only. Zombies will be present in various ways across the map. They can go solo and roam around, or they can come as a horde, which will force the players to make quick decisions on how to get around from point A to point B. another thing to point up regarding the city ‚Äì most if not all the buildings and houses should be completely accessible, giving the players the chance to both search for items and find shelter during their playthrough. \n \nWEAPONS AND ITEMS:\n \nThe weapon range and variety in the game will be rather big, ranging from light pistols to some heavy-duty machine guns and sniper rifles. Various attachments can be found and equipped on the weapons seized, and some of them will include scopes, laser targeting sights and more. RPG's, grenades and C4's will also be present. Night vision equipment will be in the game, but getting ahold of it is going to be incredibly hard in order to preserve the balance of the game, so these kinds of items would be very rare and not easy to find to begin with. It's also important to stress that both classes will start the session with some items and weaponry from the get-go, including at least one melee item in order to have a chance against zombies in the early game.\nOther items in the game will include various types of foods to regenerate health and stamina, different types of shoes (some really quiet which is useful, other less quiet but increase your running speed, good for other situations) and also armor vests helmets. Each player will also have a flashlight right at the beginning of the match, the batteries on these can run out but you can find new ones along the way. The use of flashlights is not always recommended, and for obvious reasons. However, if you want to signal your location to a team member, this can be a good way to do it if they got far.\nThe game will have some cars, but even if you or your team manages to get a working one, you'll probably want to drive with the lights off to avoid detection as much as possible, if the sound of the engine won't turn you in first. Some cars won't have gas, but it is possible to find gas and use it for that purpose.\n \nEND GAME AND VICTORY\n \nLike in other BR games, the last surviving player or team wins the match. However, the game won't feature the traditional ""circle"" that pushes players towards a randomly selected center, and instead will overrun some areas with so many zombies, that players will have to get away from those areas and find new places to settle, until eventually players from all across the map will find each other roaming the streets and houses and close fighting encounters break here and there, as often as the game progresses till the very end. Matches should take between 30 to 40 minutes and sometimes even more. I don't want the matches to be too short, and I want each player to play at their own pace in order to build up the tension and enjoy the immersion of having to fend for your own, unassisted majority of the time.\n \nSo that's pretty much it, that's my dream concept for a battle royale, and I'm pretty sure it'll be a very controversial concept for many, specifically because of the night setting. But I can assure anyone who's worried about it, that it can be super refreshing comparing to what we have today.

j4t7a8,bio- besiege. A creature engineering game.,"Pretty ambitious idea, have no clue how it would be made, just an idea. \n\nThe concept in summary, inspired by the movie ""The Thing"" and the game besiege. Similar to besiege, but instead of machinery, you are using living tissue to shape a creature. \n\nGameplay consists of building up biomass of various types, using that living material to shape your abomination, and controlling your abomination as it hunts for more prey.\n\nThere would be two main modes of gameplay, the action adventure mode, and the creature creator mode.  \n\n\nWhen in the creature creator menu you can change you creature in many different ways. adding limbs, moving around bones, growing new organs. Depending on how you shape your creature, depends on its performance while you control it. Not adding enough limbs, or strong enough legs will cause you to move slow, or be immobile. Adding jutting bone from a swinging limb could be used as a effective weapon. Or growing more brains and hearts to increase your overall performance.\n\nThe game could be played casually, making a creature that is simple in design but effective. Or you could dive into the more complicated. Example of simple would be a creature that has large horns and rams prey to impale them. More complicated would be a creature who through a series of muscle groups and joints, spits sharp bones as a deadly ranged attack.\n\nAs you explore in your environment, you have to adapt to it, legs capable of climbing vertically, protection from new enemies like a shell or thick skin, and new weapons to kill your prey when what your using stops being effective.\n\nThats pretty much it."

Gameplay becomes more like Saints Row, but you can still manage your sim like any Sims game just use ya phone homie. The Playa's phone has apps that pertain to all the actual Sims 4 player activated menus. You can now choose 2 new areas to live in that both have new ways of living.

jmvuo6,Risk game with Custom Map compatability,"So, I'm thinking a game that's available on Steam or something. It would be a version of the board game Risk that you could play either alone with computers or with friends and/or strangers online. However, what would set it apart from other Risk simulators is that it would have functionality for custom maps. My idea for how map making would work is you could open up an image editor like Gimp or Photoshop and use preset colors that the game could automatically convert these images into maps. Perhaps they could use certain colors to map out a continent, then separate each territory with a brown border, and use black lines to indicate travel lines over seas. The game would then create bonuses depending on how many territories each Continent has and it could have automatic checks for any territories that are impossible to enter. You could then name the different territories and continents in game.\n\nI'm not sure how easy it would be, but I think it'd be possible."

jmtl2v,Why doesn't someone re-master/re-create Blood &amp; Glory?,"Blood &amp; Glory 1 and 2 were some of my favorite mobile games but due to Glu basically abandoning it it's not compatible with newer devices. \n\nObviously, you can't re create an exact game with the same name so why doesn't someone make their own version? We could change and add a lot of things, hopefully for the better.\n\nI'm sure I'm not the only one who loved those games and would like to play it again. Honestly, if there's a reason no one has done it yet please let me know.\n\nNote: I know there are a lot of re makes on the play store already, but pretty much all of them are terrible rip offs. I'm talking about a serious, complete Re-master."
jmsc9f,Story-driven FPS game with a WW1 theme.,"You play as a regular soldier of the Czechoslovak Legion. You will experience the frustration of a soldier who is fighting against his brothers(Austria-Hungary) to fulfill the ultimate goad - founding Czechoslovakia. \n\nThe story is divided into chapters. Once you will be fighting in a big battle like Zborov and next time you will be persuading your brothers from Austria-Hungary to join you. You will experience several strong moments like hanging one of your friends for treason when Hungarian soldiers found him.\n\nGameplay will try to balance arcade and realism. You won't be able to run wherever you want, you will need to think and not rush enemies like Rambo. On the other side, guns won't be as hard to handle as irl."
jmqeey,Captain Toad x Fire Emblem (Nintendo),"What if you had a bunch of multi-colored Toads battling enemies on a grid in real time? Similar to a Fire Emblem or even a Warriors game, you can direct your slow Toad buddies to fight other characters with certain types. The strategy part of this game is that the enemies are weak to a few classes but resist others, but you can reclass your original crew before the battle and level up the stats of each weapon. \n\nYou navigate certain maps and strategize where you want your brigade to be and what classes your crew grow into. You can also recruit other Toads that you find during your exploration of these maps but you can't reclass recruits. Some class examples include Treasurer, Tracker, Swordsman, Spearfighter, Rocketeer, and Wyvern Rider.\n\nFinally, of course, there is a realistic Fire Emblem dragon as the final boss.\n\nIf you have any ideas about this or want to make a game like this please let me know!"
jmmewd,A team based shooter where you actively sabotage your team.,"Imagine Overwatch for purposes of other mechanics; it‚Äôs a team based shooter which has similar terminology to what I‚Äôll describe.\n\n\nIn this game, you do your standard fight with the enemy team. However, only three players can win the game, despite having six on each team.\n\n\n\nPlayers can sabotage each other to earn ‚ÄúSelfish points‚Äù - being next to others and refusing to heal, destroying a trap, and even harming them can be used to gain Selfish Points.\n\n\nThe three players with the highest Selfish Points wins. However, there‚Äôs a catch. If your team loses the game, no one on your team receives their Selfish Points they may have earned. \n\n\n\nYou need to be a team player and harmer at the same time. Killing teammates rewards tons of points if they‚Äôre near enemies, but almost none near spawn. Selfish Points are gained based on how much you harmed the team.\n\n\nReminder, there is no role that can‚Äôt be Selfish. Tanks can stay behind their team lines, healers can refuse to heal, all of which score plenty of points. You just need to make sure your Selfishness outpaces the others without throwing too hard."

jmm1pw,Brainstorming for a 2 player competitive game that I could reasonably make by myself.,"I've been thinking of making a game as a long-term project for a while now, but whenever I try to think of something fun and original, I end up feeling that it's flawed in some way or another. This is usually because, for the player, it's too complex or takes too long to play. I'm too used to playing MOBAs and Hero Shooters, but I know something like that is outside of my scope so I want to make something that I believe is within my current ability, as well as my ability a few years from now. Most importantly I want to make something that somebody else would want to play, not just myself.\n\nI'm not really looking for a full-on idea, just some inspiration to help me get the ball rolling. Here's a brief specification of what I'd like the game to have:\n\n* Made in Unreal Engine 4 (or Unity if I decide to go 2D, though I'm more used to UE4 with C++).\n* 1v1 game.\n* Free to play.\n* Turn-based, or realtime in a form where latency doesn't matter to allow for an enjoyable experience even with P2P (Peer 2 Peer; no servers).\n* Simple graphics, with blocky terrain and units represented by static chesspiece-like models.\n* Likely some sort of 2.5D/3D checkerboard pattern for the playspace. If 3D, some sort of 3-Tier cover system would be ideal.\n* Deckbuilding, but probably not a card game (rosterbuilding).\n* Factions and leaders, which both determine which units, items and powers you can add to your roster. Game is likely won by killing the enemy leader, which is also a unit.\n* Lots of statistics/keywords/abilties for different units.\n* Items (like Pokemon items) for units and powers (like Hearthstone spells) for leaders.\n* A mix of competitive and casual gamemodes for wider audience appeal.\n* Preferably a ""new age fantasy"" theme, similar to World of Warcraft (swords, magic, beasts rudimentary firearms etc).\n\nSome games I like if that helps:\n\n* Smite\n* Gears of War\n* XCOM\n* Overwatch\n* Hearthstone\n* Pokemon\n* Rogue Company"
jml3p9,"Looking for review: Tactics deck-building game, epic fantasy style","So I have some ideas for a game, and I want some feedback! The game as it's being made is a tactics based deck-builder, with elements of FF Tactics, Gloomhaven, Into the Breach, and Slay the Spire. I want to know what people think of the storyline, what you would change, what sounds boring or overdone, etc. Critique away :)\n\n**The World as it seems**  \nEach Character represents a former soldier, returning as a hero from a victorious war, all having served together in the same unit known for their efficacy and cunning. Having had their fill of hell, they now strive to wash away memories of death and mayhem, both enacted on and by themselves.\n\nThe world itself is divided into various countries, but unified in their faith. The Church is an omnipresent factor in life, and demands all men follow a strict ethical code. The Church focuses on improving men‚Äôs souls, and have a single ‚Äòdivine‚Äô connection: the Angels. Angels in Entea are rare to see or interact with, but are the real stewards of the Church and it‚Äôs actions. Normally talked about in teachings, the Church is not upfront about the Angel‚Äôs tangible interactions in Church policy.\n\nThe Church itself influences each country to various degrees, but generally does not hold complete sway over any. Instead, each government and populace is more or less religious, and follow the Church‚Äôs teachings and penal advice to a corresponding degree.\n\nThe teachings of the Church are mostly ‚Äògood‚Äô, but strict. Punishment prescribed is harsh, but fairly meted out. The one absolute in the Church doctrine: you must not kill, with the notable exception of those who have already broken this rule. You may kill a killer (but not someone who has only killed a killer). Beyond mortal punishment, the Church teaches this stains a person‚Äôs very soul, carrying their crime with them after death, with no ability for redemption. The Angel‚Äôs are the most tenacious advocates of this teaching, and will themselves almost never kill, even when technically able to, and despite power far greater than any human.\n\nSeparate from this, Demons inhabit the world. Generally crazed with little regard for rules or life, these misshapen creatures are stronger than all but the most powerful of man, though none has ever surpassed an Angel. The Church teaches these creatures are embodiments of evil, and their very existence brought about by evil done by man.\n\n**The World as it is**  \nThe Church really is as righteous as it seems; there‚Äôs no corruption allowed, and any found is quickly and severely punished. The Demons are another matter; those are actually created by the Angels, and are simply men who have committed the Mortal Sin, and been unlucky enough to be selected for individual punishment by an Angel. Through a process known to the Angels alone, a man can be transformed, with all facets being enhanced. Most notably, a person‚Äôs personality is made more extreme, and their outward appearance changed to accurately mirror their soul. The Angels are trying to show humans what evil looks like, and let all see an evil man for what he is. The Church is active in seeking this punishment, not so much as a desire to see the wicked get what they deserve, but more because it shows people what the Church fights against. It is viewed as ‚ÄúThe ends justify the means‚Äù, as it brings people closer to the Church, and therefore increasing the Church‚Äôs influence, which in turn helps the people.\n\n**Plot Summary**  \nThe Characters gravitate toward the Church as a means to atone for the things they‚Äôve done, and to find peace. The Church is happy to have such reliable assistance, but are ever aware of the ‚Äòstained‚Äô nature of the Characters‚Äô souls. The game revolves around the Characters‚Äô redemption. They seek it despite being told true redemption from a Mortal Sin can never be achieved.\n\nThey quickly find themselves agents of the Church; traveling the world, helping those in need, and most notably, killing Demons when possible. Half way through the game, they stumble upon a ceremony in which a murderer is being turned into a demon. It is the first time they see an Angel first hand, and quickly confront the leaders of the Church. They learn the truth, and while they are not confident creating such creatures is the right thing to do, they also are forlorn to see first hand the state of their souls.\n\nThey redouble their efforts to do good in the world, but feel less ‚Äòholy‚Äô when slaying demons, knowing that they were just men - killing men was what they sought to stop doing. Not long after, they encounter a demon who is...different. While he is extreme, eccentric, and grotesque - not to mention quite strong - he has a familiar air. Instead of killing him, they end up talking with him, only to learn he is their former commander in the war. The Characters‚Äô unit was quite adept at their job; they lost some, but killed countless more. His actions and prowess, combined with the peoples‚Äô love of him, enraged the Angels; rather than being requested to punish a known killer, they took it upon themselves to punish him directly, turning him into a reflection of his soul after the war.\n\nBut he was never a mindless killer; he trained extensively, and was as disciplined a man as there ever was. This discipline allowed him to control his urges, and redirect them toward his own salvation. Instead of seeking to kill indiscriminately, which he had already done enough, he spent his efforts to help people of the world, and to put an end to the Angels‚Äô influence on man. He believed man could be redeemed, and the rigidity of the Church‚Äôs doctrine did not give men a chance to change, or to grow as people. He took it upon himself to prove this with his own actions.\n\nThe Characters take to the commander, coming to believe in the possibility of their own salvation, and all those who have sinned. Working discretely to undermine the Church, and eventually strike at the Angels themselves, it comes to pass that the commander finds himself overmatched. A trio of Angels arrives unexpected, and decide to directly put an end to the commander, quickly overpowering and killing him, despite an admirable fight on his part in which he is able to slay one of the three. This shows the Characters that Angels can be beaten.\n\nThe Character‚Äôs are not given the same fate; despite being guilty of the Mortal Sin themselves, the Church appeals on your behalf, believing you coerced by the commander‚Äôs demonic powers. Uninterested, you being beneath their notice, the Angels acquiesce, but the Characters have other plans - they continue the commander‚Äôs plan to strike at the Angels while continuing to appear as agents of the Church. Toward this point, they learn more of the transformation ceremony used to create demons; rather than being something strictly available to the Angels, anyone with the components and prerequisites can perform such a ceremony, thus further cementing the Characters‚Äô belief that the Angels are not as above man as they seem.\n\nWhen they finally reach the end of their plan, they are again thwarted by the Angels - despite immense preparation and planning, they are simply too strong for the Characters to ever stand against. This time the Angels decide the Characters have been given enough chances; they perform the transformation ceremony on the Characters, strengthening them, bolstering their existing traits, and changing their forms to...nothing. The physical transformation does nothing (or perhaps, gives positive traits), as the Character‚Äôs souls have mended. Despite the sins staining their souls from the war, they have atoned, and now have the power to stand against the Angels from their own hand.\n\nThe final battle ensues, the Characters vs the Angelic Lord that slew their commander. Upon winning, the players have a choice - kill the Angel, let him go, or perform the transformation ceremony upon him (maybe just the latter option, TBD). The Angel laughs at the Characters trying to perform the ceremony on him, for he has not killed a man with an unstained soul. But as his wings turn black and horns grow to replace his halo, he realizes the truth - the commander he killed, despite being a demon, had redeemed himself, and made his soul whole again. That murder stained the Angel‚Äôs own soul, and the whole of the Church sees the truth; that redemption is possible, and people must have a chance at it. The Angel turned Demon flies off in mental and physical anguish, unable to reconcile these events with his own view of the world. The Church loses many followers, but itself transforms, becoming a more tolerant force for righteousness throughout the land."

jmfg5s,Gun Game/Arms Race Idea,"Hey everybody! I have had very little Reddit presence but I believe I have a million dollar idea. \n\nThe idea is for a game where you get kills to evolve your gun, eventually getting a certain amount of kills to win the game with a melee weapon. This has been seen as a gamemode in several different franchises (Call of Duty and Counter Strike to name a few) but has not been appreciated for what it could be. Imagine having a game that is made for this and contains weapons from thousands of different games. Anybody familiar with Corridor Digital's ""Ultimate Gun Game"" will know exactly what I am talking about. \n\nI am thinking of a large map with 100 players where players are in an all out battle trying to get 100, 200, maybe 300 kills to get that sick knife kill to win the game. It's a fantastic idea, and there is so much opportunity with this idea I would love if a game developer would be able to make this somewhat of a reality. I have always loved playing Gun Game but have always felt it was lacking, and I would pay good money to play a game that has a bit more RNG and a ton of weapons from classic games like Halo, Portal, Half Life, and Call of Duty. If this is even a possibility is unknown to me, but if anyone knows if it's possible let me know."
jmeyp4,Social Deception Oregon Trail,"An idea I heard from a podcast I listen to but tried to flesh out a bit more. \n\nA social deception type game (Among Us, Project Winter) mixed with Oregon Trail. So, group of pioneers, one or two (depending on party size) are the ""imposters"" tasked with sabotaging the trip, rest are of course trying to make it to Oregon. Game flow goes as such:\n\n1. Each day shows an overview of the caravan going from place to place (just like the original, or Banner Sage like) with random events interlaced. The random events and hardships can be influence based on ""impostors"" actions in the towns and locations. Which leads to next part:\n2. Each location the caravan enters starts a section where the posse looks to buy supplies for themselves or improve their caravan with more oxen or wheels, etc. The impostors on the other hand are trying to sabotage either the wagon itself, the posse (through sickness maybe, or through turning the location ships against the posse), or the oxen.\n3. The final part of the game flow is the campfire. At the end of each day on the trail, the posse gathers around the camp fire for some discussion. This is akin to the emergency meetings in Among Us. Here, pioneers can be voted out of the posse, or not, depending on the discussions.\n\nOther than that, to win, get to Oregon for the pioneers, sabotage trip for the ""impostors""\n\nAs far as graphics go, I feel like the graphics in Project Winter would be absolutely perfect for this. Same camera as well. But honestly even 2D like Among Us would work.\n\nI have very little game dev experience but I have years of programming experience so I technically could probably work on this if I really tried but, full time job and such takes up time. If anyone wants to take a stab at this for realsies I would definitely be willing to learn/help out along the way because I feel like it could be a good game. Just an idea! Definitely looking for more ideas and feedback as well."

jmdm2q,Want idea for a simple mobile game,Hey with lock down in my land I have more time and I want to make something. So got any ideas ? I'm looking for something simple that could be done by one person
jmd0nv,"Medieval, top down, zombies, survival, crafting, village building, exploration","I'm several weeks in on a new game idea and would love to get some initial feedback (good, bad, ""already been dun""). Here is the prologue:\n\n&gt;You return to your village at dusk after a full day of working in the fields. As you approach you realize there is no one to be seen. Abandoned, but not without a trace, there is blood and gore everywhere. Where were the bodies though? A sense of relief comes over you when you hear footsteps behind the tavern. You can vaguely make out Sam, the bartender, but he is covered in his own blood and a look that he is no longer living. When his pace quickens once he sees you, it becomes obvious that he only means you harm. You turn to flee the village. While you are running, out of the corner of your eye you start seeing dozens of others in this same state coming after you. After running through the night you finally come to an area you feel safe. What happened?!\n\nHere are the general gameplay mechanics:\n\n* Set in the Medieval age\n* Top down view of character\n* Chop down trees, hunt, gather resources, etc.\n* Craft items, weapons, armor\n* Build a village by constructing buildings (that gather resources, craft additional items, arm villagers) that must be assigned a worker to operate. ie. a hunting lodge where a worker will hunt and gather meat for you, or a tavern where a cook will take the meat and make a meal to be consumed, an armory that makes bows for villagers, etc\n* Villagers are ""recruited"" by exploring other villages and outskirt areas to find survivors that will join your village\n* Once village is established, have villagers join a party to explore further/more infested areas\n* Set up trade with nearby villages with resources not available in your region\n* Zombies occasionally attack village, villagers (from your village or others) occasionally turn into zombies. Many zombies will come together to form hordes, where you must find ways to manage away from your village (decoys, fires, etc.)\n* Village can be built up for defense, walls, watch towers, guardsman, etc.\n\nThat's the general idea, thoughts? Feel free to ask anything!"

jmaq0c,Long Range Desert Group Simulator (open world singleplayer rpg),"Premise: Stationed in Cairo in an uninteresting post, you volunteer to join the Long Range Desert Group in 1940, a british motorized special forces unit.  From 1940 to 1943 you'll be a member (and later take lead) of the 10-15 men patrols (with 6 or so trucks and jeeps) in the libyan desert, doing intelligence gathering, topographic recon, road watch (spying upon the via balbia, the road from tripoli to bengazi), raids (such as operation caravan) and attacking isolated german and axis positions. You'll also have quests such as transport british SOE and SAS agents to their targets, guide the SAS across the desert, gude a british division across mountains near the Mareth Line in a flanking attack to the axis forces, assist italian anti-fascists, negotiate with french forces in Chad, search and rescue missions for british pilots that crashed in the desert and for lost members of the LRDG.\n\nGameplay: combat and vehicle gameplay exactly as in Hidden &amp; Dangerous 2 (like Arma 3 basically).\n\nMain quest: After joining in Cairo, you participate in a desert navigation training mission the leader of the LRDG, Bagnold, did near the nile valley. After that, you move to the Siwa oasis with the rest of the unit, and you join one of their 3 to 10 patrols, each acting independent of one another (for example one was active watching tobruk, another bengazi, another near el agheila, and another operating from kufra, at the same time in 1942).\n\nAs you follow the main quest you'll advance the main checkpoints in the campaign which are aligned with the main conventional battles, such as compass, battleaxe, crusader, gazala, el alamein, mareth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMain map goes from Gabes in tunisia, to all of libya and north Chad, to El Alamein. Cairo is a separate small map.\n\nFeatures: rest, food, water and warmth/cold meter. Night and day cycle. Map is blank until you explore the areas of the desert, except for the main locations (kufra, siwa, and the coastal cities). To navigate by yourself, you must use a sun compass (there'll be a navigator in the patrols when you are with them and so he'll do it for you). If you get lost in the desert another patrol may be sent your way for rescue. Cars will break down very often requiring you to fix them. \n\nFull character customization: can choose from british, new zealander, indian and rhodesian nationalities (in 1940 it was basically only british and new zealanders but for more options the indian and rhodesian patrols will be active since the start in the game). For gear anything, german, italian, british or from the natives, will be available for the player (lrdg soldiers wore whatever they wanted, as long as it was comfortable. Officers werent strict with these things nor did they have any special treatment when it came for resting and food and the like).\n\nSkill trees: mechanic, gunnery, driving, first aid, navigation, stealth, cooking, leadership, explosives.\n\nExample of a quest: your group is sent to relieve another patrol in the road watch for a few days.\n\nYou follow the patrol with your own truck, going from Kufra to near El Agheila almost 1000 km away. You leave before 5 am, and by 12 pm the patrol halts as there will be no shadow in the sun compass for the navigator to work out the position. In the meantime an italian convoy is seen across the distance, the unit immediately ambushes it. Later they continue towards el agheila, but you all (6 trucks and 12 men) stop for the night and set up camp. You then must camouflage your own truck, check the engine, the wheels and your equipment, and start a campfire and eat and drink what you are allotted. You talk to the commander of the patrol and then you sleep. Fast forward and by morning the next day the patrol  goes on,  and they hide some 2km from the road. You then must walk to 200-300 meters from the road, with a notebook, a pen, a binocle and no weapons (so that if you are captured you bluff that you were lost in the desert, and thus not giving away the position of the patrol). For the next few hours (say some 20 minutes in game) you gotta identify all vehicles, weapons, and enemy units (from their uniforms, helmets and so on) passing through the road. The only thing to help you is a little page with enemy vehicle silhouettes (which you would burry in the sand if you are spotted). - every time a vehicle and a unit passes you get a popup with a number of options, and you choose without knowing if its right or not-\n\nAfter you've done that another two soldiers relieve you and the other, and you return to the hiding place of the patrol, where there is no campfire (due to how close it is to the road). The success of this mission appears in the next quest where the LRDG commander will say, back in Kufra or the siwa oasis, if the british army reacted correctly to the enemy movements or if it was somehow misled ... by you.\n\nLater when you become a leader of a patrol you can control your men like in Hidden and dangerous 2 and arma 3, and you'll also be able to talk to the LRDG commander back in the oasis and choose your own type of patrols sometimes (though you'll also be specifically told to do some tasks as well, such as: we got word two beaufighters have crashed in this area of the desert, go pick them up with haste). Back in the oasis you'll also be responsible to go around talking to the HQ and support sections and getting all the required equipment for each patrol adventure, the extra cans of fuel, food, etc. Each patrol has a navigator, a cook, a mechanic and a signals officer, each with their own dialogue and different options while in the desert and amidst the quests.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe HUD should be minimal and the fewer cutscenes the best. Like in rpgs you should set up your own bedroll and click to go to sleep and rest. The desert should be beautiful and mesmerizing, like this description from David Lloyd Owen, the last commander of the LRDG, from the book The Long Range Desert Group: Providence their Guide: \n\n‚ÄúSomehow one feels unfettered by any of the harsh, restricting influences of human existence as we live it these days. There are no buildings, no roads, no street lights, no artificial or even natural noises, no hustle and bustle, no need for anyone to shout or to have money or to pretend about anything; those human beings who are with you are probably fairly well known to you, and are there for the same reason that you are‚Äîthey know the dangers and delights of solitude just the same as you do, and they will react to the unblemished and staggering loveliness of a huge expanse of desert sky, deep blue by day and of a marvellous purple at night sprinkled haphazardly with hundreds and thousands of stars silently lighting up that great canopy of night-time that drifts down with the close of day. I personally think I know of nothing more restorative than lying on the soft sand‚Äîcool now after the retirement of the day‚Äôs sun‚Äî and just staring at the miracle of such a sky. And then you fall asleep, rolled up in a sleeping bag against the considerable fall in temperature as the night goes on, perhaps waking an hour or two before dawn for just long enough to notice that those little stars are still there‚Äîas bright as ever‚Äîand do not even look as though they are getting ready to be extinguished by the advent of another day. It is a lovely, comforting feeling when the world around you is quite still; and there is no sound anywhere to penetrate the delightful peace that surrounds you. When the dawn comes, and the stars have all gone away, there is something sharp and exhilarating about the smell in the air. It is fresh and clean and tantalisingly different to the atmosphere which will pervade the day once the sun has come up over the distant horizon. Then there will be no escape from its merciless and desiccating heat, which drains you of energy and leaves you burned and incapable of any prolonged activity. And the bright reflection of the sun off the light-coloured sand can be piercing and painful to the eyes. There is probably not even a tiny breeze to move that sullen, sultry air, and there can be no relief from its effects until once more, and inevitably, the great ball of fire that is the sun will slide slowly below the land and allow it to grow cool. It would be foolish to pretend that all of those who served with the LRDG saw the desert in the way that I have described it, all or even much of the time. But I am quite sure that when their minds were not diverted by rather more pressing considerations concerning the enemy, there were few who were not moved by the beauty of the sky at night. They all spent quite a number of hours on sentry duty, when, alone with his thoughts and in such surroundings, no man can be oblivious of such a miraculous revelation.‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBasically a mix of Hidden &amp; Dangerous 2 combat and driving, Arma 3 open world and Mount &amp; Blade Warband/Bannerlord party and skills mechanics."
jm2y3e,User Generated Single Player RPG,"The core concept would be a bit like Runescape with tons of skills, and all sorts of quests and grinding. But almost the entire game will be generated by users, and the AI. There's no end goal, just skill, build, craft, fight, and get generally beefy. It's specifically intended to never truly end.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's the more interesting bit. Once a week (or so) it gets updated. The updates (aside from fixes) will be entirely user generated. Players will have an account they can log into online, and submit their weapon/armor/pet ideas, NPCs, and even quest schematics, all of which are subject to approval. Once they're approved, they go into the que for the next update.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe quests are pretty much endless. The schematics given will be missing specific details that the AI will fill in like a madlib. A farmer could give you a quest to rescue their prize pig from a bunch of bandits, but some other player will get the same quest from the same NPC to rescue their favorite hen, or their stupid dog from a kid who stole it in the night, or a band of masked ninja mimes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nQuests can also be randomized, specific to the NPC type. That same farmer can ask you to harvest his corn, or beets, or kill a basement full of rats or goblins. Gaining a certain level in a certain skill will trigger a new quest somewhere in the world, and the NPC quest giver will have a job somewhere in line with that skill, and the skill level will be needed to do the quest. Getting close to that level will trigger that NPC to mention a quest, but that you couldn't possibly complete it yet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBasically, you can be traveling around with your pet mini unicorn, looking for a fight with your elite level sock with a rock, wearing your best spandex and sombrero, when you get a quest from a merchant asking you to steal back his 20 bottles of tomato wine from a band of dancing werewolves, and deliver them to someone in the next town over...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEverything user generated would start out with a few ideas from the developer, of course, but they'd get replaced by anything new that comes in. The quests could pile up almost indefinitely, as they are just text, while anything with a texture, like weapons would be rated by users (once in game), and replaced at lower ratings by newer additions to keep up a certain folder size."
jm1vrd,Alternate universe Post Chernobyl,"This idea came to me just yesterday, in a nightmare. So a lot of it may not be very good, rough around the edges, way to large, or just plain stupid. But it felt like a really good concept in my mind. And I'm still getting the creeps typing this. Also I am not so big in the Nuclear Fallout game genre so there might be some overlaps, but I hope you can bare with me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Story\n\nSo basically you're a simple bloke, add some backstory here. That goes to the abandoned site of an exploded reactor for a what was initally planed as a simple check up lasting a few days. However, in the town nearby you hear multiple rumors of the last inspectors all dying and there being talk of a psychopath living in the grounds around the reactor. Not minding these warnings you enter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Places\n\nNow, this is where the entire thing starts to get really cost intensive. We obviously got a small village, then there's the nuclear powerplant. However I was thinking there should be a bit more. Like an emergency bunker. Now there are only two rooms I have figured out so far. The control room and a printer room in the bunker. So the control room not having barely any natrual lighting would make it really dark, also thinking some kind of vine or moss overgrowth. Then there's the printer room, this one is actually tied to one of the main mechanics and based off one of my workplaces rooms. In it you find a large professional printer, as well a large table with one of those sliders with which you can cut A0 papers. Underneath a still a lot of cardboard boxes with paper in them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Mechanics\n\nObviously the player goes there to observe, study and document the radiation levels around the deserted grounds. Thinking some entry levels, moving around and trying to probe certain things. \n\nThen there's still the psychopath running around, which simply kills everybody getting close to the reactor. You being a scientist it's either run and hide. The paper cutting table coming into action here. \n\nNow this last one is a really far leap, but every game has a final build up. Most have a final battle. Since we aren't playing Bruce Lee I had this as an idea. As our character spends not days but weeks in dark corridors, constantly being hunted, he slowly decends into madness. Yet getting yanked out of it as th psychopath turns the reactor back on, resulting in a nuclear fallout type situation, and the player has to fight his way to the control room to turn it off.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Characters and enemies\n\n1. There's the player, expert on RBMK reactors. However this does not necessarily have to play in the Soviet Union, it's simply the one I pictured, due to it's many safety related issues.\n2. The NPCs in the small village.\n3. Some higher ranking officials which send you to the reactor.\n4. As well as the psychopath. Full biohazard suit, PBF gas mask. Running around with a fire axe. Obviously a mad man. He got deployed on the first clean up duties, but was presumed dead. Somehow survived and used his basic knowledge to try and fix the reactor. Turning everything into a ticking timebomb. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI said at the beginning it would be a large undertaking, but having typed everything down. I now see this has become a huge undertaking, much larger than I originally anticipated. Story, still a wonkey as hell. But personally, I think a concept stands.   \nOf course, would love to hear inputs and notifications if anybody dares attempt recreating this huge pile of work. :)"

jlt5lv,A quick match style game centred around finding a fugitive,"The game has a similar style to how to you can play with four friends in phasmophobia and is based of a manhunt in an area and the goal is to find the fugitive who could be in any of the houses within a set time limit, you and your friends can have a set amount of gear with a price system similar to phasmophobia because better gear costs more, at the end if you find the fugitive you get money."
jlmiv1,Backup Rockstar,"A karaoke game with a campaign mode that has you start off singing at small gig venues where you're eventually noticed by a big artist/group. \n\nAt a glance, it may look like your average karaoke game, loaded up with a wide variety of music and lyrics, much like we're used to, but there would be criteria that starts off simple, providing tips as you progress. Early levels would just require being able to follow the lyrics on beat, with advanced/late game having some kind of meter that gauges how well you maintain keynotes, octave reached, etc. The ""tips"" could be even include subtle integrations in gameplay: an on-screen music staff that displays the expected notes and also your current note sang (which could help provide immediate feedback on where you're at tone-wise, how long to hold a note, and doubles to familiarize players with reading music)."

jlfk1h,PistolWhip Artstyle on an FPS Multiplayer Shooter,"[PistolWhip on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1079800/Pistol_Whip/) for those that don't know the game (SFW + guns, no blood)\n\nAnother great example is [Superhot](https://store.steampowered.com/app/322500/SUPERHOT/) (Steam Link, SFW), so here's [a Youtube video on the concept of minimalistic art covering Superhot](https://youtu.be/2tKxah6nzec?t=114) (again, SFW + violence and no blood)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm mostly talking about the polygonal art style, but also the added minimalism adds a great tone, as there's a lot less to focus on around you, so focusing on your enemies or weapons will be so much easier, since there's- like, three colors. \n\nThe ""time only moves when you move"" wouldn't be a thing in this game, since it's multiplayer and it's not a mechanic that I'd think would go well with the main game, even if it was implemented.\n\nthe genre is FPS; 6v6 (or 5, or 7, or 100, I'm attached to any numbers atm) player versus player battles. Pistols, Automatics, snipers, etc. would be used, and throwables such as grenades and smokes are totally in play.\n\nThe main focus will be graphical play. What do I mean? Well, if you've played Pistolwhip ([Video](https://youtu.be/BV74sDclikE?t=21) if you haven't), you'll know how the environment moves around you as you play. It adapts to the bass and beats of the music. What I want to create is an interaction of the player shooting, throwing grenades, and everything sound related to interact with the environment. Just shot next to a wall? The wall reverberates at the same time as your shooting. A grenade just went off? The floors and surrounding area would recoil and fall back into place as if shaken.\n\nIf a multiplayer game is too much, it can be against bots, although it might just become a shittier superhot clone at that point.\n\nOh, also reloads would be insanely cool IMHO, since the guns would be reacting to themselves making sounds, so things like your grip reacting to you putting a mag in, or letting the slide fall forward would be sick to animate *and* watch."
jlfgrm,"A Pok√©mon Red/Blue &amp; Gold/Silver Remake that is close to the source, but improved","I am mostly writing this because I am FASCINATED by the way the old Pok√©mon games work and the old Gameboy/Gameboy Color hardware.\n\nThe game itself would be written in a modern Assembly dialect, meaning that the restraints the GB/GBC processors had could be used for improvements.\n\n\- I imagine it as a sort of combination of Red/Blue &amp; Gold/Silver with day/night cycle, and Mons that only appear during the day/night.\n\n\- Game would play out like the originals, but the player character would be different (would be weird if Red was facing himself in the ice cave).\n\n\- Alternatively, you DO start as Red or Gold or Silver, but who you face is dependant on who you start with.\n\n\- Improvements that could be made are: Full color sprites, a bigger map (Kanto and Johto, maybe include some anime locations, like Sunny Town, which should be somewhere near the cost, OR some FR/LG locations), overworld sprites for Pok√©mon, including some G/S mechanics, G/S Dex, maybe more NPCs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLike I said, it's mostly because of my fascination with the workings behind the game.

jlf4sm,Turn-based real-time strategy,"Every team builds up their base and defenses in real time, for the first two minutes. Then battle occurs in turns.\n\nTurns have two parts, battling and upgrading, which only one player does at a time.\n\nIn your turn, you send a raid of your units to the enemy's base. The goal is to capture loot, by destroying buildings. At the end of your turn, if you manage to capture loot on your raid, you use it to upgrade your defenses and buy/build more units. If you choose not to send a raid, you get a small idle bonus, which tends to help the weakest player stay in the game longer.\n\nResource gathering is by attacking AI depots, so it still uses the raid system.\n\nWhen it isn't your turn, you essentially just observe, however you can do really basic control like changing the direction of units without moving them."
