Songs in the game are their song too. Bosses are really hard to beat. They're corrupted politicians and billionaries. Hollows are the office workers. Our sole purpose to fight them is to save our world from the inevitable end of destruction and madness."

noqubk,Xenoverse but with Transformers,"Your created character is discovered to have the unheard of ability to assimilate deceased cybertronians, which obviously would inspire fear and disgust in both sides. Tutorial would involve Decepticons attempting to put you down as a potential threat, and Autobots rescue you. Once they discover this ability, they start quietly debating what to do because of the political disaster that would occur on Earth, and you'd run away because they might do you in themselves.\n\nAfter some more cutscenes and plot events, you're given the choice of Autobot or Decepticon: The former recognizes you as cybertronian and wants to help and guide you into properly using those powers, while the latter sees you as a very useful and powerful asset that could turn the war in their favor."
non82v,Need Ideas for a MetroidVania style game.,
nomk45,An architecture-based fighting game.,"You've heard of ""Hostile architecture"", now apply that to an FPS.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEssentially, it would be a 1v1 where both players design a building and then fight on it.\n\nA ""setup"" and then ""action"" phase, if you will. Setup is while you are in a sims-like UI designing and action is an FPS where both players fight to the death - one player starting in the building ""defending"" and the other starting in a parking lot outside ""attacking"". Similar to Siege.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn setup, there are no real ""kill"" structures or infrastructure you can really use. No turrets, spikes, etc. Rely on your weapons to kill the enemy.\n\nHowever, building does come into play for a large degree. Naturally, the attacker is **MUCH** stronger as they gain some extra armor and know the layout of your map. You *NEED* to rely on quirks of your building for strategic planning.\n\nThe enemy has 12 hours in game (4 minutes irl) to enter. This is *important*.\n\nFor example, simple infrastructure you can build is counters which can only be vaulted over for dangerous chokepoints or shelves that you can hide behind or underneath.\n\nFor much more advanced play, you can curve windows to reflect light onto certain sides of your building to blind enemies during certain hours of the day (determined by the angle of the window and the in-game hour.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd since this is based on fighting games, there are a few playstyles you can make through itemized kits via customized action-phase items.\n\n""Rushdown"" players will have quick mobility-items and can surpass smaller obstacles such as shelves and desks, but are pretty bad against long-ranged control plays such as turning corners in longer corridors.\n\n""Zoners"" pressure opponents from distance with many slow-moving projectiles or long-distance rifles, but aren't great against more congested areas with more hiding spots.\n\n""Grapplers"" don't exist, as this is an FPS. However, you *can* play a ""Brawler"", a playstyle designed more on melee-range weapons so you can take full advantage of crowded hiding spots.\n\n""Jacks"" are just Jack-Of-All-Trades. A default playstyle that is a mix of any number of weapons and items.\n\nReminder that *both* sides have their buildings used in alternating attacker-defender statuses, and *both* can use any of the playstyles. You could be defending but be the first one to leave the building as you do better in the open. You could be attacking but instead play patiently near windows as you have a sniper rifle. Choice is yours.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe main part of this game comes from the architecture, as I'll state again. Since the attacker is always stronger - you need to use tactics such as making areas impossible to retreat from with many obstacles, using multiple corridors to flank your opponent, and having certain exit-zones if you lose too much territory and need to go outside.\n\nEssentially: You are playing a mini-scale strategy game disguised as an FPS. \n\nThe mechanics would be a nightmare to program as you have to essentially make 2 games. Would not recommend unless you have *moderately good* knowledge on how sims games work and how FPS games work."

nog1tn,Dig Dug 99,"Because Tetris 99 is a smash hit, and PAC-MAN 99 released a month ago, I think its only fair for the other Namco franchise to get a game like that. Dig Dug is horribly underrated. 99 players, and each Pooka and Fygar they pop goes to a random player. The map is the same as the original Dig Dug level. Rocks will appear randomly, and veteran Dig Dug players like myself know that digging under it causes it to fall. You can crush multiple Pookas and Fygars at once. Those can be sent to another player. You can also accidentally crush yourself if you're not careful. I think this would be a great battle royale game."
noei6j,Class based laser tag,"I really want to get this idea out somewhere and this seems like the best place. The name is self explanatory, but like ya’ know, laser tag with different classes to play as. For example, a tank would have a really big spot where they can get hit and a heavy gun, but also high damage, and probably longer and wider range. A speed type class would probably have a really small hit box and a light vest, and a small gun with a lot of ammo. Healers could probably be a thing, but I know no one would want to play as a healer probably. Heck, there could even be voice lines that play through speakers on the vest."

no4vrx,Open World Conquer Game,"     Alright so to start out with the game would be set back in time, and the point of the game would to be to conquer other land areas or tribes and gain alliances through trade and other things. Another thing that would be cool would be like having your warriors or troops fight like old notorious armies, such as the Romans, Spartans, Vikings, Samurais, etc. One example might be like starting off as a loner, kind of like Ark Survival, and finding resources and people to form alliances. Then your character could face challenges like random tribes trying to attack and you just have to defend yourself until you become the “bigger dog” and can defeat them and make them pledge their allegiance to you. \n     Eventually though, you would gather up enough people and you could storm into battle and conquer different land areas, and different troops or tribes. It would be an open world game kind of like Ark, and have a relatively large map. I know this might not be the place for those specifications, or there might be a game out there like this but if there isn’t I would like to hear feedback or if anyone would want to take a jab at the game."
no1tb0,Need ideas for mechanics in my scifi game,"It's essentially a game where you play as an electrician trying to restore power to a frozen, dormant research facility. \n\nYou also encounter dangerous test subjects left behind, while piecing together what happened. \n\nAny ideas?"
nny1h3,Multi-player COOP WW2 Bomber crew,"Relatively simple concept that I don't think has been done.\nYou just pick whatever role you would like to play \n(Pilot, Gunner, Bombardier, Radioman, Navigator, etc) and work with your crew to run sorties in WW2. \nRunning missions in certain billets will increase said skill. Skill level will determine what types of bombers you can operate in. \nI like the idea of keeping it bomber specific and PVE only as it lowers the stress on overall game mechanics and allows more emphasis to be put on the bombrs and crews. \nEventually it would be even better to be able to run multiple bombers on one sortie, and the only way *in game to communicate with the other planes would be through the Radioman.\nThink Cold Waters meets Barotrama in First Person in a bomber."
nnwpbd,An asymmetrical RTS based on the Emu War,"[The Emu War, for reference.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emu_War)\n\nThis would be a heavily asymmetrical RTS, sort of a blend of traditional RTS and tower defense, where you command a gang of australians with guns trying to stop a swarm of emus from destroying cropland in the 1930s.\n\nYou play on a relatively large map strewn with various features such as trees, cliffs, rivers, etc. Some parts of the map consist of farmland that you need to defend from the emus. The emus move fairly fast in semi-random swarms, and can reproduce (creating temporary nests on the ground, which later pop into emu chicks) to make more of themselves based on an ecological calculation that relates their population to the territory in which they are able to forage. Emus destroy the crops they touch, more slowly if they are being attacked or frightened but quickly if they are left alone. They can also attack and damage your troops if cornered, but tend to avoid you if they have a viable escape route. Your success on a given map is based on how much cropland you manage to save, with proportions below a certain threshold qualifying as failure and higher proportions granting increasingly higher score. Obviously there is a fog-of-war hiding parts of the map that aren't near your own units.\n\nYou gain constant (or periodic) flows of cash, at a fixed rate for any given map, with which to fund your anti-emu operation. You can spend the cash to hire troops with various weapons, as well as laying down barriers (fences, ditches, etc) and buying horses and trucks to improve the mobility of your troops. Troops can be assigned patrol routes and formation orders to better guard important areas. I'm thinking there could possibly be a component about setting up supply chains to bring supplies to your troops in order to boost their fighting ability, but I'm not sure if that would improve the gameplay or just cause annoyance to the player. Another option would be to give troops an upkeep cost in addition to their hiring cost, capping the number of troops the player can deploy on a given map and forcing a balance between getting more troops vs saving up for a bigger push later on.\n\nI'm not sure how australian aboriginals could figure into the gameplay, but they should definitely have some sort of presence. Probably there should be an option for hiring native troops, who fight with throwing sticks and other traditional weapons and are stealthier than your normal troops, with an emphasis on close-range combat and fast movement on foot. In addition, perhaps some maps could have native tribes (visually distinct from your own troops) who are hostile to both the emus *and* the player, creating a strategic element of trying to avoid the hostile natives while also manipulating the emus in their direction in order to make more efficient use of resources. (Not sure how historically accurate this would be; what, if any, was the extent of violent clashes between colonists and natives in Australia's history, and particularly the interwar period?)\n\nFor a sense of progress, the game could provide a campaign of successive levels with increasing map size and availability of more types of troops and equipment. However there would presumably be a random map generator for one-off battles as well; the terrain layouts would be suitable for randomization. In order to provide greater gameplay variety, maps could have the prices of various things tweaked in order to encourage different strategies.\n\nThe idea is for the gameplay to be less focused on the preservation of your units like a traditional RTS, and more on the tension between tactical efficiency, resource constraints, and the transition between defense and offense. The fast, somewhat random-yet-patterned movement of the emus should create a sort of hectic feel to the game, keeping the player constantly on their toes and maneuvering troops to contain the emu swarms. Ideally, the emu AI should be set up in such a way that the player can get a 'feel' for the movement of emus on any particular map and start to leverage that against them as they reproduce and increase in number. Varying the AI parameters between maps would be another way of enhancing gameplay variety, although it might be difficult to pull off in a way that isn't annoying to the player.\n\nFor graphics I'm imagining 2D pixel art and an overall appearance kind of like WarCraft 2 or the old Command &amp; Conquer games. Units should not however be confined to a coarse grid of tiles, as emus should be able to swarm into tight groups at times, and come in very close physical contact with troops and other objects. The ground would typically be a relatively uniform orangey-brown color, allowing units, cropland and other objects to stand out by contrast. Keeping graphics simple and computationally inexpensive would hopefully leave more room for interesting AI and mechanics even on large maps.\n\nMusic should ideally be a blend of rock or western styles with some aboriginal instruments and chanting, and a good fast beat to match the hectic gameplay and create a sense of urgency. Also, bonus points if the troops speak in thick australian accents.\n\nI'm not really envisioning a multiplayer component, but if there were one, it would probably be co-op with multiple players fighting the emus together, rather than trying to give a player command of the emus themselves."
nnuk0s,Possible idea for an RPG twist,"Okay, so this legit came from a dream last night, and part of it was some kind of static map screen of a fictional version of our solar system (part of it being some satellite that's closer to Earth than the moon that's labelled planet ""Monkey"" but is also called ""Berzerk"") that you'd wander around for your next destination.\n\nAnyway, the main premise was that you were on a mission from God to discover the secrets of the universe. However, one of the biggest secrets you discover is this:\n\nGod created the universe to find the reason for His own existence.\n\nThere was something about how he was in some blank void for an undetermined amount of time, and created the universe to have something to do, and left the people living in it to find that reason. But you could just make up your own stuff there, the main thing I wanted to share was that twist.\n\nbtw: if you decide to make this plot twist in a game, can I get some revenue? Like 1%? I'm broke as shit."
nnua1h,I'd like some feedback on my fighting game character choices I have left,"This is for my horror/scifi/fantasy fighting game project that I'm working hard on, which was slowed down due to covid, but now hopefully things will start toget better. I'd love to get many opinions from which characters are the best choices to go with, or if anyone has any feedback on how I can use the other extra characters and turn them into something interesting, you can let me know. If you think some of these ideas can be combined into one character then you can let me know as well.\n\nI appreciate all the help and feedback. So here are my choices for which ones to pick from.\n\n1. (A. Lovecraft-inspired sea creature that wears a yellow raincoat? Or (B. Lovecraft-inspired ancient pirate creature that wears pirate attire?\n2. (A. Feudal Japanese female ghost that uses telekinesis powers from afar? Or (B. Feudal Japanese female ghost that is more like a zombie that starts off slow, then rushes in fast to attack?\n3. (A. European/French gothic tall woman elder vampire from the Victorian age? (B. Ancient Eastern European gothic tall male elder vampire? Or (C. Inca/Mayan inspired tall elder vampire woman from the Amazon hidden temples?\n4. Half-turned female half-vampire who wishes to become fully human again to break the curse. (A. Make her a tall female from the Victorian Age? Or (B.

nnmz0d,A cooking/war hybrid game.,"Have you ever heard the phrase ""an army marches on its stomach?"" Or perhaps ""all mutinies start in the kitchen?""\n\nThis game features a food fight of epic proportions as anthropomorphic food dishes battle for culinary supremacy. Tortillas fly through the air, dropping sunny side up egg bombs on burger tanks that shoot caustic hot sauce. Matzos balls roll into battle to deploy kosher dill rifles.\n\nThe very core of these armies is their kitchen, where master chefs concoct new deadly delicacies from base ingredients and equipment.\n\nThe players control chefs, who run around the kitchen experimenting with different recipes to counter the chefs cooking up the opposing army. The gameplay would be sort of like overcooked or diner dash. The core gameplay involves moving ingredients around the kitchen and putting them together in the right order.. Each dish you create goes off into the battlefield and fight the enemy foods automatically, and you can see the foods slowly move across the battlefield to attack your kitchen while fighting any defenses you can cook up. In this way it is kind of like a double sided tower defense game.\n\nThe winner is whoever can get their armies to the opposing kitchen and destroy it first. You have to learn the recipes to use them, unlocking more recipes in a tech tree as you cook more complex and deadly dishes. Every dish has at least one counter dish at a similar power level. Some dishes move more slowly or quickly than others, or have more or less armor.\n\nMobile tag applied because this kind of game sounds similar to a lot of ""strategy"" games already on that platform."
nnlrq8,A sci fi horror escape game where you’re fleeing from a monster on Venus,"Feel free to use this idea.\n\nThe game that I envision takes place on a huge research facility on Venus.  Scientists discovered Venusian DNA from an organism under the surface, and combined it with human DNA.  What resulted was a monster that killed everyone but you, since you managed to quickly hide.  The master computer was programmed to activate the self destruct sequence if any life form is identified that could threaten the Earth should it somehow return.  The only two still alive are you and the monster, and you have 30 minutes to reach the shuttle and flee before the facility is blown up.\n\nThe facility is a maze, and the map changes in every game. You need the right key cards to open doors and proceed towards the launch pad to escape, and the only way to find these is on the dead bodies of your former colleagues.  You also need the launch code for the shuttle, which can only be found in the security office.  Sometimes, you will need to operate machinery to move obstacles, but to activate these machines you need a key from a maintenance worker’s body.  Due to electrical damage done to the facility, the lighting is poor and everything is dimly lit. There is no background music; only sound effects from machines, your footsteps, and the monster.\n\nYou have no way of fighting the monster, since there are no weapons on the base. Running and hiding are the only options.  The monster moves slightly slower than you, so it will take a while to lose it should it find you.  You are evicerated if it catches you.\n\nYou have 30 minutes to escape, and once you reach the shuttle it takes 15 seconds to climb in, strap up, and blast off. It also takes 20 seconds of ascent to reach a safe distance from the explosion, so you really have about 29 minutes and 25 seconds to reach the shuttle.  If you reach the master computer, you can shut down the self destruct sequence, but that takes 5 uninterrupted minutes at the keyboard, and with the monster hunting you, that is a long shot.  Successfully shutting down the self destruct sequence gives you unlimited time.\n\nThis is a single player game, but there could be tournaments where players log in and race each other for the best escape time.  Players can also submit their best times, and the server would keep track of the best completion times worldwide.  The difficulty level determines how intelligent the monster is as it hunts you, and each difficulty level would have it’s own top scores."
nnl5ag,Publishing a good 3d game in 3-4 months,"Hello everybody,\n\nI am an extreme beginner who has just gotten into game development. I have started with the 2d unity course on Udemy and am almost midway. Even though I am really passionate about game development and plan on continuing it for a very long period, a big motivation was to create a game before mid September to add something nice to my extracurriculars list for my university application profile but now I have come to realize that it won't be possible to create a good 3d Android game before the end of the year with this pace along with the other school related and academic things I have got to do\n\nI have thus planned to buy the source code of a game from an indie developer for a 3d game and then make some tweaks to it maybe with whatever I have learned by then and then publish it on play store. I know it's kind of a shortcut but I won't technically be lying or anything on my application by choosing my word carefully there. \n\nAny suggestions relating to the way I should do it, places where I could contact an indie developer for the source code of small but good 3d game of his, types of games which can be changed drastically with tweaking or maybe any other alternatives to my idea of publishing a game earlier than mid September for a beginner game dev would be appreciated \n\nThank you"
nnfooa,Moddable Generic Board Game,"Basically, I always thought someone should create a video board game, that has a few different games, only the game itself is moddable. This way, any mod designer can create their own board games, or clone ones they know, for an ever growing library of them. It could be played offline against the computer (part of the modding process, and vanilla design), or online against others.\n\nAll the modders would need is a basic template; a blank board, generic money, blank cards, dice, and game pieces to be designed to their liking."

You taking care of animals and having interesting exhibits all that park management stuff with a twist you also have a camping creature hunting/taming mechanic.\nYou have to hunt and capture your own exhibits(not kill. Like say you want the Jersey Devil, you have to research a  bit of lore and decide on the proper traps/bait. You have KO the creature without killing them. Similar to Arks taming system.  You have to physically (in game of course lol) go on a hunting trip to capture and survive.  Because some of the creatures are violent and will try attacking. Were talking multiple types of Bigfoot.

nn0wcu,Need Game Name Ideas,"I wont go into too much detail of the idea of the game, but I want the name to encompass that there is a war causing chaos in the Country you live in, Ordonia, between the kingdoms stationed there. The game contains the option to choose between a Light (Angel), Dark (Demon), and Neutral (Hacker) alignment, so having a name encompass those would also be good. You also choose from a large amount of classes to start out your game, and the game should not have too serious or dark of a tone, so try to keep the name from sounding too dark, you do not have to encompass all of these ideas, however, the tone must not be dark no matter what."
nn0ajo,Capital,"Who doesn't enjoy a little capitalism every once in a while? or maybe you'd prefer to watch a system crumble? Build an economy or join an existing one, where your goal is to build and sustain a strong hold on the world. in this world the rules are built by a player and the players in their community. build and lead a free and open community, or build one where your rules are final, with one goal in mind... watching others crumble. feeling weak? want something a neighboring community has? build an army and take what you want. but be careful, they may have allies. \n\nthis may sound similar to a few other games out there, but to make it unique it will be from a top down perspective where the player controls their character in game, and will have to work for the community they live in. they will have to buy food, vote on rules or events they want to see happen, and enlist in their community's military. with this game idea I'm trying to build something casual, that hooks people in with the struggle for power.  \n\nnot sure if ill ever be capable of coding and building something like this, so i thought id put the idea out there, just incase someone wants to give it a try."
nn07hk,"Requesting high-level world design suggestions for a suburban ""metroidvania""","Hi, all. I've been fiddling with a game concept and am trying to figure out how I can blend the theme, genre, and setting together in a feasible way. Mind helping me out?\n\nIn summary, the core idea is: a 3D first-person horror-themed ""metroidvania"" set in a suburban town.\n\nI say horror-*themed* because the town will be cursed/haunted -- think Stephen King's *IT*, but with more than one evil entity of varying appearance and modus operandi, plus enemy fodder roaming the streets -- and though you'll be given some tools to fight back, there will still be a lurking sense of dread and maybe some jump scares along the way. You won't embody a character like *Doomguy*. You'll play a teenage resident of the town given some tools to help you combat the threats.\n\nI put ""metroidvania"" in quotes because most of them I've played have been 2D and set in dungeons or caverns (*Hollow Knight* is my current favorite). The Zelda games also have elements of the genre, but the maps are also much larger, spanning regions rather than being isolated to one town.\n\nSo the problem I'm having is: I want the player to unlock items and abilities that require them to revisit areas that have... ""sub-areas"" they couldn't previously access without those items/abilities; a common trend among the genre. But, how can I design the map of a suburban town to fit this criteria? Most metroidvanias have vertical scale, and those that don't have a sprawling map (like Zelda). There aren't really skyscrapers in the suburbs, so vertical scale is hard to come by. I will definitely incorporate a sewer system, but other than that, the suburbs seem kind of flat. Any suggestions? Thanks in advance!"

SJWs, punchOnazi, feminino maniacs, rona19 lunatics, woke lobotomits, gawkers, Woke Legends, uncle Sam(woke soldiers with guns)....etc\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAn NPC approaches our woke slayer and screams at him ""check your privilege"" at what point our slayer pulls out his shotgun and shoots it in the face.\n\nEnters a bar and another NPC is trying to send our hero on a fetch quest... \n\nSlayer- ""What do you think I am? a dog?"" and shoots him in the face... while looting the body he comes across a recording... which makes our slayer very curious about this heist gone wrong a meteorite and a princess from another world. what could the 3 have in common? could she help him get back to his world? ""Hmm Interesting indeed,"" he thinks.\n\nThere is no much of a law enforcement left... after defunding the police were successful and the army gone woke. every man for himself. It is madness, it is chaos, it is bloodshed..... looks like fun.\n\n Finding parts/technology to help you return to your own world may prove difficult. This new world you find yourself in is without reason and beyond hope... but there are rumors of hidden places where decent and reasonable people live and where you can find allies/help.... but earning someone's trust to divulge such information may prove EXTREMELY difficult. unless you get lucky and come across it yourself. but I wouldn't hold my breath. \n\nalso, the Dark  **Reapers** pursues you.\n\nThe strong will rise above it and the weak will crumble.\n\nWill you be the Woke Slayer?  Can you handle it? or are you already triggered? :)"
nmy8zu,The game of food hybrids but living,"We all need a new game. Here's my idea! It's a game where the small enemies are chickens, ducks, and turkeys and the water levels have crabs, lobsters, and octopuses. Hear me out. The bosses are different variants of the turducken. The first boss being the turducken, the second Being the crobster (crab and lobster), etc. Well as the game goes the normal overworld and underwater animals start to become monstrosities as they start merging with each other until they each become one animal. The final boss is the cthuken. It is a giant animal with the head of cthulu, the body of a chicken, and the legs of a crab. This would be a great game IMO. Hit me up if you want more details but please be specific about what you want for details and If you are going to try to make it I want credit for the idea and I want to participate in the making of such game"
nmwhcp,I am in search of a game idea,"Hi guys, can you give me idea for a unity game... might be 2d or 3d..."
nmtuve,“Once upon a time… life” but it’s a videogame,Is it just me or would that be a great concept for a videogame? Not the same style and characters but something next-gen realistic-ish… I say keep the miniships tho!

nmslrw,What do you guys think about VR games ?,Can you please tell me what you think about VR games and drop me some ideas for games. Could be anything.
nmlwlk,History of a gene (and maybe a seducing simulator),"You are a gene that appeared in ancient times. Your carrier can have only one child. You must survive.\n\nYou control your human, you work, eat, fall in love, give offsprings and die. You could be pushed off a cliff in ancient Sparta, drawn with Titanic, killed in WW2, decapitated during revolution. You can be a knight, rape a peasant and be born as a peasant. You can be queen's lover and be born as a king. You could be moved from Europe to America during the Gold rush. You can be a nerd not able to find a girlfriend. Every epoch, region and status will provide different choices.  \n\n\nI hope you get my inspiration. Consider a visual novel as a possibility."
nmj0tz,So thinking I'm gonna make a horror FPS with some roguelike elements.,I'm not exactly sure HOW roguelike I want to make it but I know I want to have it be present in some way. I want to know if adding these elements would be worth the time or just build regular levels and leave out the roguelike stuff?\n\nThe loop would be similar to Streets of Rogue where you go back to the main area hub after a run and you buy equipment and stuff to prep for your next run. Only I plan to make the runs more risk and reward as every 5 levels will grant you an opportunity to escape with all your earnings or die with half of them intact. Would making it more roguelike add to the experience?

nmezal,Babushka vs the Forces of Stalin,"When brother and sister agents Illya and Sasha are captured by the forces of Josef Stalin's empire, the situation seems hopeless until a rouge agent steps onto the scene to become the one-woman army that will bring down the communist nation: their grandmother. In a side-scrolling, pixel art action platformer, Babushka will throw, grapple, and bash her way through a myriad of enemies and bosses, all culminating in a final showdown with Stalin's Kremlin mech."
nmdhk3,I'd like to see a 1v1 superhero detective game..,"I had a dream about a game.. kinda like the newer batman series but more sandbox. Where one player is the hero, the other player the villain. The villain selects a ""scheme"" like a heist in GTA5. Once they start the first part of the scheme the hero is notified a crime was committed and is sent to investigate. Think of the beginning of Dark Knight. The potential could be amazing. Or there could be multiple villains and one hero that has to track you down by finding clues. Villains work their way up a ladder to be crime bosses.. The hero has to build a name for himself by catching low lifespan. The villain has to be aware of the people you hire to help, cameras at the target area of the crime, witnesses etc. You gotta select masks.. just a realistic in depth superhero game where you can experience the process of being a villain or hero. Slow paced and thoughtful."

nm3o0i,Kong Skull Island,How will you make an open world survival game with the IP. any suggestions?
nm203w,Alternate-History Shooter,"I've always enjoyed alternate history things. Shows, movies, games, maps and others. There aren't many alternate history games and even less that get popular. I like Wolfenstein, but I want to focus on other things than Nazis, or at least in the conventional setting.\n\nThe game would be similar to battlefield's War Stories. I'm thinking it would have two and possible more campaigns instead of one. They would obviously be shorter than a normal one. I'm thinking 4 hours to a campaign if I did more than two and 8 hours if I did two. For now I'll focus on the two main ones I thought of that I hope I can make one day.\n\nFirst Campaign: Dragon's Winter\n\nThe name references China being called 'Dragon Country' and other similar names. In this timeline, Japan doesn't enter WWII and joins the Allies instead. Germany is defeated much later because the United States does not enter the war until 1944 after an American embassador is killed by the germans in Berlin. This campaign would focus on a Chinese man who is conscripted into the Japanese military after Japan conquers China in late 1938. China's civil war never happens. The game and story involves him fighting for the Japanese military against the Nazis. In this timeline, the Nazis invasion of Russia is much more successful. It pushes the Russians back to Siberia. The Japanese join the Allies in 1944 just weeks after the U.S. The campaign opens on a coalition force of Japanese and Russian troops driving in armored transports towards Nazi defensive positions in the Urals. Intel suggests that a high ranking Nazi general is hiding out in the Urals after a recent defeat in the area. The coalition force fights their way up a mountain path, evading mines and patrols before breaking out into all out combat with the German forces near the top. The force is pinned down by machine gun fire. They are forced to take cover and settle in. They send two small groups along small paths up the mountain too small for the vehicles or the entire force. You'll find a cave system that has been fortified. The other group will radio to you that they found something in a Nazi cave base and that they need reinforcements. You'll fight throught the cave system and rejoin the force as they push up the mountain. The other force had found a vantage point and taken out the machine gun nests but won't respond to radio contact. As you push through the base on top of the mountain you find a entrance to a cave. It has a stockpile of german artillery. You also find that a large construction project is being conducted in the cave. A Gustav cannon is being constructed and assembled there. It was planned to be used to shell cities in Siberia. You attempt to destroy the cannone while repelling german reinforcements. The campaign ends when you and another group of soldiers are pulling artilery pieces and ammo outside to use against german reinforcements. A massive explosion rocks the cave system and you hurry out with the artillery. You set up the artilery and shell german reinforcement as a few more explosions rock the cave system. After you fend off the reinforcements, Russian transport helicopters arrive and evacuate the force slowly. The germans make one last Blitzkrieg up the mountain. You are forced to abandon the artilery and fend off the germans until everyone has been evacuated. The mission ends are you fly away in a helicopter under heavy fire as you fire out the back. \n\n(Please note that the first military helicopters were used as early as 1944 and while it was not widespread nor used for the role I described, in this timeline the combat capabilities are developed earlier and modified R-4 helicopters are bought by the Russians.)\n\nI will edit this post to add the other campaign soon. It is late and I don't feel like righting much longer. Hope thats ok."
nm1b6n,Why is nobody talking about this.,Can we please get a Gta 4 DayZ mod 😐
nlwy7a,A VR vs PC game where you beat up leprechauns trying to steal back their gold,"In this game the VR player is a human who has found the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow while the leprechauns aren’t around. The PC players are leprechauns who are trying to steal back each individual gold piece from the VR player. \n\nThe VR player stands around the pot of gold and can punch and throw the leprechauns away from the pot. Full body tracking for VR would make kicking the leprechauns away a viable option. Players with a large play area would be able to to make use of that without a virtual movement method since they are defending a single point.\n\nMultiple leprechauns are playing with mouse and keyboard or controller from a 3rd person point of view. Rag doll physics would make it satisfying when they are struck by the VR player. The leprechauns are small so they can only carry one gold piece, but they are given some abilities (such as temporary invisibility or super speed) that have a cooldown so the game is more balanced and enjoyable for the PC players.\n\nThe PC leprechauns win when they get back all the gold. The VR human wins when a timer runs out."
nlvw6n,like sea of thieves but more monster hunting focused,"The idea is an open world rpg where you start by carrying cargo from A to B in a ship that has defenses that starts with a merchant ship hull and harpoon canons and you have to fend off a few pirates as usual, you can also go into towns to buy armor and weapons for either your character or your ship as well as recruiting crew members and selling pelts and extra cargo\n\nby the next part of the game things get a bit weird your character picks up a single statuette as cargo and is tasked to drop it off at a cave that is not marked on your map and when you drop it off weird things start to happen when you go receive your payment, titanic creatures are said to be spotted just under the surface of the ocean and above the clouds, lightning storms are happening more frequently\n\ntwo factions: port towns, the cult (maybe more later)\n\nability scores: strength,agility, intellect,madness,willpower,luck\n\nit's an idea so tell me what you think and any ideas you have"

So why is there no collab with EA and Paradox to make this happen. I WANT A COLLAB WITH EA AND PARADOX"
nlm180,Spy Master Strategy Game,Either turn based or real time strategy game where you manage a spy network
nllxq9,A VR game where all you do is punch people in the back of the head for walking too slow in front of you on crowded pedestrian sidewalks.,"I was told to cross post this from here:\n https://old.reddit.com/r/CrazyIdeas/comments/nldoek/a_vr_game_where_all_you_do_is_punch_people_in_the/\n\nYou could pick crowded major city tourist spots from around the world, pick your language, etc.\n\nThen the fun begins.\n\nAll kinds of annoying slow people to punch in the back of the head. Short people. Old people. Fat people. Groups of people walking side-by-side. So many kinds.\n\nThis game will be about total emerging the player in the moment; the sound effects, physics of the punching and collapsing of victims to the ground after punches to back of head, and suround sound gasps and shock from surrounding witnesses.\n\nIt's about making you feel like you really did just punch a random person on the sidewalk for simply walking too slow in front of you. Like you were really there.\n\nEdit: At some point I think players can unlock Shoving and Spartan Kicks, to add some variety to the gameplay.\n\nEdit 2: I just want to thank all of you for your great input and enthusiastic support for my vision.\n\nWe can pivot this away from the traditional VR market, and market this exlusively to the upscale crowd by partnering up with the Peleton people, who will build a custom 360 Treadmill VR Punching-People-In-The-Back-Of-The-Head-Who-Walk-Too-Slow-On-The-Sidewalk Workout Machine.\n\nThis would open up bum rush mechanics to the gameplay, which I'm excited about.\n\nNo reason both can't happen, I suppose. Peleton may want exclusive or preferential rights to this technology, so the lawyers may have to work out this part."
nllbhh,Dota Ability draft rogue legacy MMORPG,"I dream about a strange MMORPG related to dota and some others game like Rogue Legacy.  \nThis is my first post here and just want to share. Maybe you will love that :’)\n\nI played 2700 hours straight on the Dota 2 ability draft mode. That is basicly standard Dota 2 mod with random characters but the fun part is that you have to choose your own spell in a random pool that everyone share at first. This mod can be very strange, and is not very appreciated in the dota 2 community  but he give you a huge meta. Also what puzzle me is that all 120\~ dota 2 heroes have more personality than many MMORPG « class » even with only 4 or 5 spells.\n\nFor sure, I play them only for « 1 hour » at the maximum, but they provide a funnier experience than many real time mmorpg I played who give you like 30 spells at the same time.  \n\n\nSo let me explain the concept on this hypothetical game :\n\n**Basic resume**\n\n* Fantasy or Science fiction.\n* Real time or not (aka Dofus).\n* Only 1 playable character at a time.  \n\n\n**Character development and environment**\n\nA very « boring » human at first who grow by exploring the world. All the abilities aren't learned automatically by his class or level but by real experiences in the world. \n\nThe character is a bit randomized in term of physical attributes, basic talents and comes with no real spells or abilities. I was also thinking about to randomize his sex.\n\nHe can learn something like 10 spell at the maximum, but need to choose between them to have 5 active spells.\n\n* He encounter a Fire remnant during a dungeon : He can choose to learn fire ball spell.\n* He mary to a women : He learn a spell to have a relation with someone and share some health / buffs.\n* He progress in a desert : He can learn a passive spell to have status resistance.\n* He made trading at some place : He get some attributes related to « trading » ??? \n* He make a child with some others player : He learn how to… I mean, you get it, right ?\n\nSo all the environment is no more used to provide experience point but… learn something, and get a gameplay experience based on affect of the player. If someone want to crawl into dungeons, it can be a great warrior. If someone want to make social stuffs, then he get better at it.\n\nI suppose that you will be asked if you want to trade one of the 10 slots by a new spell or keep your « deck » like it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe main idea of this game is that you will become the character that you choose to be based on your adventures and choice, and not being dictate by a « talent tree » or class.\n\n\---\n\n**Replayability** \n\nYour character is designed to growth, make a family, spread is genes, and … probably die… like on many stories.   \n\n\nBecause he can have only 10 spells, it can be boring to play thousand of hours with it.\n\nYou will discovery characters from players or IA, and will be able to have relations with. Friendship, union etc. If you have 10 abilities, 5 active, 5 muted, and you meet another player, then you can have a baby with it.   \nHe will become a new playable characters with mixed physical attributes, a name, and 5 basics abilities (5 empty slots) randomized or even mixed in some aspects based on the father and mother.   \nLet's say one is a crystal maggot who made Ice blast and the other one is a character with Armor reduction AOE spells, then you can get one of theses spell or a randomized mix « Ice with armor reduction » or « Armor who ice enemy when they hit ».\n\nI think that this is part of the fun to « lost » some characters (also a way to made space), but maybe you can keep some important member of the family, and have a maximum number of playable character who growth by playing, meeting new people etc.\n\n**Spells and abilities**\n\nAbout the list, Just give a look about the abilities provided in Dota 2. they have a huge personality. I played at AION, Wow, Star Wars or Warhammer, but for some reason's I can't even remember to one spell except that some was making damage, some armor, some healing. For some reason they don't attract me at all. It's probably because you have plenty of them, and that for balancing reason they are close.  \n\n\n**Leveling and composing with the deck**\n\nThe deck itself remains, but lever of each spell can vary during adventure.\n\nLet's imagine a dungeon, you're on the entrance with your team of 4 friends. You have to pick 5 of yours 10 spells, then go to the first « room ».   \nAt the first room, all your spells are level 1, every room you can choose to level-up 2 spells. So you will do many choices for every dungeon. It's the same choice that you usually do when leveling a moba characters.  \nWhat I want to add in the gameplay with this mechanic is to be able to focus on great strength on early or late game. e.g : First room very hard but a easier fight against the boss.  \n\n\nSo, anyone want to play at my game or not ? :)"
nlhno3,Interesting death mechanic for rpgs,"so if anyone heard of the alleged ""time traveler"" john titor, he once said that going back in time is moving to a slightly different dimension that is more different the further back you go.\n\nso the idea is taking that concept and applying it to death - the player will have changed stats, gear, skill tree etc the further away it goes without a checkpoint.\n\nthe reason I think it would actually be good in terms of design (maybe with a couple of twiks to prevent it ruining player builds) is that if a player keeps dying at some boss eventually they will get by a chance a good enough roll on their things to beat the boss.\nand players who are doing good will be punished for dying"
nlg56a,My first game ideas . Pls pls pls tell me how it is. Please don't copy,"It's a 2d vertical endless game where we play as a monkey. Imagine there are 3 - 5 trees trunks on the screen. we are climbing those tree very fastly. There are branches on these trees if we touched branches, we will die. if there is a brach on the left side of the tree, we will go to right side. if there are branches on both sides, we will jump to the next tree(s). using WASD/IJKL/Arrow keys.\n\nAs far as we go, speed of the game increases. There are chances for 3 trees having branches on both the sides."
nld1z3,Why hasn’t anyone made a real world simulator?,"Like gta but survival and rp built in with people trying to make money build a house and build an empire you can have families, like tribes in ark. People try to destroy what you got or rob you. Kinda like rust and ark but modern world. It should be a lot like gta just with better features like food and water. Gas for cars. Jobs or you sell drugs and save money you know just hustle and build like online businesses that generate money and money can only be stored in a base or home so you can get robbed if things are destroyed you gotta build or buy them back."
nlcb4d,Jump The Birds,"Hello mates, we've created a game called [Let's jump the birds](https://www.happykidgames.com/game/jump-the-birds) . What do you think?"
nlabj7,A game were you level down - instead of up.,"You know how in most games you level up and up and up - and in the end you become so overpowered not even the strongest enemies are any kind of  challange to you anymore?  \nI noticed this while playing Horizon Zero Dawn, for example. I started a new game and I was like: ""I don't remember this game being so hard"".  \nIn the beginning, you have nothing, even the simplest of enemies are a real challenge. The difficulty curve is the inverse of what it should be! Some other games have this problem as well.  \nYou know this trope where you start of the game with all your powers and max level (Darksiders 1, for example) but then you lose all your powers due to story reasons and you have to get them back over the course of the game? -&gt; Why not make this gradual? Losing your powers, I mean.  \n\n\nLet's say you have a space-ship that is fully upgraded, a huge variety of weapons, max. shields and armor, etc. You blow away anything and nothing has a chance against you. The game starts of easy.  \nBut over the course of the game's story your ship becomes more and more damaged, individual weapon systems go offline, your shields get weaker, etc. -&gt; As you lose power / options that are presented to you, the game gradually becomes harder.  \nThe enemies you fight, however, they kind of stay the same in terms of the threat they pose. But since you will have less and less options to fight them, the same enemies become harder and harder to deal with.  \nAt certain points in the story, you will get the chance to repair certain weapons / buffs you have lost - but only ever one at a time. By the end you will have a ship that is perfectly suited to your playstyle - because you will only ever keep the weapons/upgrades you can't live without - while saying goodbye to the rest.  \nThe hard part will be to balance things - you could say: ""Duh, I will obviously just keep the stongest weapon"" - but as you lose other weapons - you will be utterly defenseless as you wait for your weapon to recharge, that can only shoot one very strong shot every minute or so.\n\nOf course it doesn't have to be a space shooter - this conept would work with a variety of genres."
nl4jpy,Unsuspecting Dating Game (Time travel and more),"I had this idea suddenly come to me when I was eating my dinner and I really want someone to make it, so that I can play it. \n\nSo this is just a normal, dating game. You know the same old, guy has to choose a girl from this group. He goes on dates with everyone then he falls in love with one. Now this is the interesting part, after you complete the game, it will zoom out to a timeline branch and each branch will be labeled with the girls names so that you can choose that alternative path with a different ending. At first it will seem like you’re playing the game again, but at the middle it becomes a murder mystery and now, as the mc you have to find out who killed her with your time traveling abilities. At first the player will be like “ok I can get the hang of it”, then BAM! Your original timeline (the first time you play the game) and your current one, will collide and now you have to choose between your original girl or the new girl. There can be ideas of yandere, imposters, an universal creator, impermanence or any ideas that makes your player think and feel uncomfortable at the same time. \n\nTLDR: Normal dating game become time travel murder mystery once you play it the second time. Later destroys all idea of a linear timeline by combining timeline A with timeline B then being forced to choose one girl over another. Also a sprinkle of philosophy to get your players head to hurt :) or Doki Doki Literature Club! X the anime Erased."

The only thing you notice is that you can move furniture, pick up objects and talk to random NPC's in the building. After following around for 15 minutes you switch characters but now you slowly begin to realise you can actually kill people. After some time you get a report on how you behaved, like the thing in GTA 5 after finishing the main game."

ntn76a,A game that players complement in real time," Let's say this is a 2D pixel game (like any game on BYOND DREAM MAKER), where people can create anything. To do this, they need to create craft, sprites, animations and code (maybe something else), and after passing moderation (or without moderation) this something will be in the game.  \n The idea of the game is quite simple, but the implementation is difficult even to imagine  \n The game itself will be something like a life simulator. People will be able to add different things, mechanics and generally anything.  \n This ""game"" will be more than just a game. Whole universes can be embodied here. It is literally a real-time multiplayer game constructor. This is my dream game."
ntm8sb,Here’s a game idea that i have severely downgraded because my game is too difficult to make even with a team of 15,"Going off my other idea similar to the division i have come up with one idea. It will still use a looter shooter aspect just the gameplay being different \n\n\nHow about instead of having a set map and set missions you take on expeditions (procedurally generated) and continue to play them as you level up and get better gear and weapons. There will be x settings: underground, city streets, wildlands and city ruins (heavily damaged scenes such as collapsed buildings, blown up roads and such) \n\nYour main goal is to make builds to take on powerful content such as raids and assaults (mini raids like incursions). \n\nThere will be many gear and weapon attributes, many talents and weapons that are all modern. \n\n\nThis is all you will be doing at launch. Daily and weekly quests and more content will be available at a time after the game launches. \n\nThere will also be many apparel choices such as masks, helmets and outfits. \n\nThis is the first game I’m ever developing. Is it still too big or just fine?"

ntf7mv,Combat mechanics for lego game,"I wanna create a small avatar based Lego game since my sister and me are huge fans, but i couldnt find such a game. But i am struggling with combat mechanics. First i thought of just adding one bending ability per character but that would be boring, so i wanted to add multiple abilities. But since i only want to use 2 button (l-click, r-click), switching between them is some issue. Here are some ideas of mine:\n\n1. This one is based on every other lego game. If you're standing in front of an enemy and Leftclick, it punches, if you press Rightclick, you enable one special ability, like a shield. When you have some distance to other players, you can shoot a projectile of your element and also characters like Iroh could have the ""melting gold"" ability by holding Rightclick. You would see other abilities only at certain areas of the game\n\n2. A GTA V like switching method. The abilities are in the ""weapon wheel"" and you select them manually. This would add a lot more possibilities, but is also slow, because you cant just quickly switch and always have to search for your ability. Maybe some sort of Hotkey would be useful, but it should also be easily playable on a console.\n\n3. Adding some sort of combo-mechanics, based on the actions of the character. By that you can add 4 different abilities (standing + l click ; running + l click ; standing + r click ; running + r click) and also some if you hold your button pressed, click twice etc.\n\nWich one would you prefer? And if you can think of any other method, please let me know."

ntcw56,A Visual Novel Where You Cannot See the Real Appearance of Those You See Unless You Break a Curse.,"I could not think of a good way to explain through title alone. The idea for this potential visual novel is that the player (probably a blank canvas or a set ""protagonist"") receives a curse (from who or what is flexible, but this would likely not work without some method of understanding the way to break the curse or why it happened) due to excessive apathy.\n\nWhat the curse does is cause everyone, even yourself to appear as featureless, identical mannequins with identical voices. To break this curse, the player would need to establish and maintain numerous relationships. While this would be potentially difficult, each of the set characters (No ""required"" amount) would act, speak, walk, stand or more in distinct ways. If you pay attention, you will still know who is who and what to say.\n\nIf you don't, there would likely be a ""loss"" condition if you mess up all or most of the set characters. The big kicker here and I think a real ""shining"" moment of the experience would be a victory. Assuming you establish a certain amount of good connection, or through some other method, you get  a credits, a ""scroll-down"" or both. In this scroll-down, you could see the outlines of each specific character as you go down, in a specific pose and or performing a specific action. If you failed to become their friend, ect, they will be seen as only an outline of their actual appearance. If you are their friend, you can see the real, unaltered person and see just who you got to know.\n\nMaybe something special would happen if you befriended everyone without fail? The demon who could in theory have given it to you may rescind the curse in it's entirety, maybe you get a special dev message. Who knows? Anyway, that's the idea."

ntbj7p,In Our Midst - Gothic Horror City Builder,"This is an idea I've been kicking around for a while based on my love of the two genres. Thematically, think literary and film classics like Dracula and the Wolfman or game settings like Ravenloft, Innistrad, or Yharnam. It'd be a bleak existence for you and your townsfolk, but that's part of the challenge. \n\nFor gameplay and features, a day and night cycle would dictate what sort of things you'd be doing in the game. Day would be a chance to build, trade, or defend. Night would be when you hope the walls hold and your guards stand strong. And as with most City builders, you'd start with a small, vulnerable hamlet with the intent of overseeing a large, defensible city.\n\nFor enemies and challenges, there would be a wide variety of things that go bump in the night. Vampires, Werewolves, Zombies, Demons, Gargoyles, and Hags are most of my initial choices, and with most of them comes a key obstacle to overcome: Infiltration and Affliction. \n\nMonsters can and will make it into your city where they'll spread their particular curse, dooming some of your citizens to share their hellish fate, be it Vampirism, Lycanthropy, Reanimation, or Possession. These incursions will happen randomly, but have an increased chance of occurring should your defenses fall during a nightly raid, at which point a message will alert you to the threat and how to combat it. \n\nEach Monster would be thwarted or otherwise countered by different types of mercenaries, or Specialists. Slayers dispatch Vampires, Hunters kill Werewolves, Priests turn the Undead, Inquisitors exorcise Demons; you get the idea.\n\nNot sure if there's a traditional win state, as is the case with most other similar games. Maybe a boss spawns after a certain time limit based on the Monsters that have you given you the most trouble during the run, and sends one final wave of minions to overrun your city.\n\nThat's about it. If the idea peaks your interest, feel free to run with it or reach out to me. Thanks for reading!"
ntar9j,"Scalable - A GTA V-like game with the phrase ""Rags to Riches"" being a core concept","Hi guys,\n\nAs of writing this post, I'm also writing a Game Design Document for an idea I recently had for a GTA V-like game. Or similar to GTA V. I'm already working on a game called Chrome Switcher (on steam :) ), so this game will be worked on after that. Please note this game is mostly an excuse for me to practice level designing and coding.\n\nScalable is an open-world game similar to GTA V, except the economy plays a huge factor. Players can rent apartments, buy houses, form businesses, create cafes, and hire other players. They can do jobs/missions ranging from entry-level jobs like delivering food or goods to assassinating targets. This is essentially an economy simulation game, with the vehicle and gun shooting mechanics from GTA V.   \nThe main idea for Scalable is to encourage the player to partake in a ""Rags to Riches"" type of world, starting from a rundown apartment building and working your way up to billionaire status.\n\nOne philosophical concept for this game is for players to collaborate with their friends to form businesses. These businesses can sell certain products, handle shipping for other companies, and partake in other business practices. \n\nI still want players to feel the same type of excitement they have with shooting guns and escaping cops like in GTA V, which is why I'll design a system for players to create gangs and black market organizations. If the player kills someone for an assassination job, they'll have to escape the cops. If they escape, no big deal. If they get caught, some real consequences will happen. A massive bailout payment will occur and perhaps a reputation system will be implemented.\n\nSo basically, an MMO GTA V game with the economy playing a huge factor."
nt775d,Global strategy superhero game,"The basic idea is simple, you play as a global agency tasked with stopping supervillains and their organizations across the globe.  You start with basic agents and have to assign those agents to deal with various crisis across the globe, from escaped science experiments to crime sprees by super scientists. As the game goes on villains and crisis get harder, but you can even the playing field by recruiting superhero’s that solve crisis much faster and safer. The goal is to build your agency large enough to repel one of several endgame crisis. One example is an alien invasion, another is an doomsday device that will boil the oceans, a third could be an army of the dead that includes superhero’s you’ve lost on missions."

nt4ghi,Space-related game?,"The game starts out on a news channel on a TV. The news talk about the Earth starting to spin really fast and that it's gonna explode soon. After around 15 seconds, the screen goes black and you wake up on the Moon. You have 10 minutes to make a respirator or else you'll die. Eventually, you will be able to make a farm, a house, etc. Once you get bored of the Moon, you can make a rocket (using molten moon terrain as fuel) and fly to mars OR any other planet in the solar system. Once the Sun loses all of its hydrogen (and dies), you will be able to even leave the Milky Way, and make your way to Andromeda or almost any other galaxy.\n\n(fun fact: i had a dream which was exactly like this and i thought it might be a good and original idea, even though it wouldn't be realistic, since you wouldn't even be able to make it to the Moon or survive for more than 1 minute)"

nt3nky,"You run a robotics manufacturing factory that makes automation equipment. At first you use human employees, but as you improve your factory you begin to rely on automation. The goal is improve your factory to the point it can run by itself.","And then it becomes self aware.\n\nIt's half Prison Architect and half Factorio. You build machines to build machines, and then you fire the humans that are no longer necessary. You'll hire an ""AI helper"" to help you with the harder manufacturing puzzles (i.e. a hint system), but as you keep upgrading it, it'll start to automate the machine design process on its own so you can just sit back and watch the money roll in. At this point the game transforms into a clicker game.\n\nBut then you can't control anything anymore. The AI stops letting you manually change the factory or upgrade systems because *it knows better.* It stops letting you play."
nt1udp,Seagull Life: A game where you play as a seagull on a tropical island,"Feel free to use this idea\n\nThe video game that I envision is like The Sims, but you’re a seagull instead of a person. It takes place on a tropical island with two nice hotels, small shops, and a restaurant, along with lots of palm and coconut trees and a beach.  You can freely roam the island, forage for food and water, fly out over the sea or up high over the buildings and trees. You can even land on the balconies of hotel rooms and occasionally be fed bread and French fries by tourists.\n\nThe game has a 24 hour cycle with day and night, but like The Sims, you can speed up gameplay. Tropical steel drum music should play in the background. Movement is 3-D, and the graphics should be very good, since the player should feel like they’re really on the island. This is an endless relaxing game.  It would easily make for a great VR game.\n\nThe only ways to die is by starvation or dehydration, and you would have to really slack off for this to happen. You have a hunger need, which can be satisfied by catching and eating fish, small organisms on the beach, bits of edible material that you can easily find, or being fed by tourists.  Your thirst need can easily be satisfied by drinking sea water or fresh water from rain or from puddles.  You also have a social need that can be satisfied by interacting with other seagulls or with tourists.  Your energy need is satisfied by sleeping, and your fun need is satisfied by simply flying around.\n\nYou can select the gender of your seagull, and you can also find a mate and have chicks.  The nest will need to be in an out-of-the-way location, and you and your mate will need to care for the chicks.\n\nSeagull Life: The endless vacation!\n\nAirfare cost: $0.00\n\nHotel cost: $0.00\n\nRental car cost: $0.00\n\nFood and drink cost: $0.00\n\n[https://www.austockphoto.com.au/imgcache/uploads/photos/compressed/close-up-of-a-seagull-on-the-beach-austockphoto-000021815.jpg?v=1.3.0](https://www.austockphoto.com.au/imgcache/uploads/photos/compressed/close-up-of-a-seagull-on-the-beach-austockphoto-000021815.jpg?v=1.3.0)"

nszmzb,How dungeons should be,"In my complete opinion, I think dungeons in open world games should actually take time to get through. Not just the “in and out” ones that take ten minutes and you never go back, but like where it takes you an hour or two, with its own lore and npcs and side quests. I came up with this while playing Skyrim and think how the dungeons are way to simple and quick. I want to be immersed in the thought that an ancient civilization made the place and now all their technology has gone haywire. But thats just my 2 cents"
nsrpnp,Parasyte based survival game,"This idea is based on the anime Parasyte:the Maxime:\n\nBeginning:\nYou play a simple parasyte, who is really weak in the beginning. Your only chance of survival is to find a host to infect (your hp decreases pretty fast so you cant really choose and have to take the nearest human/animal). \n\nDifferent Parasytes:\nYou can choose if you kill him and replace his head or enter some other part of his body to let him stay alive. Both decisions have a pro and contra. A ""full parasyte"" is weaker that a ""humanoid parasyte"" but they have to eat less food and have buffs like sensing other parasytes.\n\nLife in a host;\nwhen you first enter the body, all you can do is eating by killing humans, learning by watching peoples behaviour wich makes you more intelligent or kill other parasytes\n\nStats:\nthe most important stats in the game are food, stamina and health. \nnpcs also have a ""suspicion"" stat. The more suspicious you act, the more likely they do something against you. (Parasytes have a high suspicion level since they can sense you but they wont attack you if they arent hungry/agressive)\n\nAbilities to unlock:\nThere is a skill tree with ""genocide"" abilities on the left and ""adaption"" abilities on the right.\n\nGenocide abilities:\n- bigger lungs (you can run faster and longer)\n- bigger stomache (live longer without starving)\n- parasyte-string (swing to reach your target faster or Immobilize it by wrapping it)\n- parasyte-wings (fly)\n- fusion (allows you to add multiple parasytes to one target)\n\nAdaption abilities:\n- human food (allows you to eat not only other humans, but normal food)\n- human mimics (you can now interact with humans without being suspicious\n- family (You can now start a family. Its up to you what you gonna do with them)\n\nObjective\nsurvive and either kill everyone else in the city or adapt perfectly, so everyone in your area has suspicion level 1"

nso9gy,Classical music RPG with avatar TLA elements,"This is an idea I’ve been brewing, it’s not fleshed out at all I just like the thought of it. It’s a rhythm game/rpg kinda like mother 3 where you are a composer trying to rebuild the Lost orchestra. You travel to different places with avatar style clans (instead of earth wind fire ect, you have the instrument families like strings and brass.) each place has some side story, like a civil war between the violins and double basses. And with each you acquire a new instrument to add to the symphony which add more lives and new abilities. Haven’t worked out how battles will work, but the soundtrack would be modernized versions of classical music in the public domain. Like I said not fleshed out at all, prob not too useful an idea I just kinda like it."
nsnov5,Steampunk MMO where your character gathers skill attributes from the enemies you defeat,"Just like it sounds. \n\nAn MMO that centers around a compelling story that enables you to 'learn' one or two ""attributes"" from a defeated enemy in order to progress. This would certainly be a steampunk-themed world, however, I'm leaning towards some raw elemental-magic-based interactions drawn from different environments/zones within the game. \n\nIt would look something like this as an example:\n\nYou just picked up a sword and can fight spiders coming from a forest. You defeat one and learn the skill attributes ""SILK"" and ""SPEED."" These attributes combined with raw magic or steam can alter the way you fight, run, carry, jump, etc. Over time, and many defeated enemies and skill attributes learned, you discover many unique combinations and are able to progress to harder and more rewarding biomes/environments, eventually unlocking a way to traverse through what would essentially be the ""last/most dangerous"" zone to finish the story. \n\nThoughts? Skill attribute ideas? Base magic types?"
nsijpr,Medical system for realistic shooter,"So I've been thinking and realized that most realistic shooters (I.e. Squad, Arma III, etc.) use the same medical system, and it's one that could use a serious upgrade in realism. My thought is that when you are wounded, you can only see the rough severity of a wound, and use bandages and painkillers to stabilize yourself. In order to fully heal, you would need to be treated by a medic, who can examine the exact type of wound, and use various items to heal it (Tourniquet, bandage, hemostats, blood bags, etc.). In addition, when a medic treats another played, they will kneel next to them. Also, perhaps when hit by a blast, or when losing a lot of blood, players could be knocked out for anywhere from a minute to two or three. As you wake, you would be laying on the ground, with ringing ears, and distorted vision. There would be no numerical system for health of a limb. The only thing you as a player would be able to see would be the location of a wound, and its rough severity. Medics could see other effects such as bleeding, concussions, shrapnel, and other wounds. I feel like this would make the outdated feeling medical system in tactical shooters, specifically milsims, far better and more realistic. Any thoughts?"

nsfitx,Very hardcore management game of an estate with DnD 5e rules for adventurers. AI is the DM,"First of all, I might have have been a bit too ambitious doing this alone, I just want to share this as it has been my only goal in the last 6 month of my life.\n\nThe project started from me having an idea of simulating a world like dwarf fortress but with AI.\n\nI have started with creating a lot of the backend work. (agents, network sockets...)\n\nThe AI part is mostly completed, with some tweaking needed to avoid some exploits (one example is that some players could act so good that gods would bow to them, granting them superpowers)\n\nGraphically, rignt now is just ASCII art (think dwarf fortress) , but it's low effort to create a 3D environment instead, is using 3d vectors with 64bits floating point for location and is not framerate bound, so any 3D engine like unity or unreal would do.\n\nThe most challenging is balancing all the spells and abilities. \n\n**So the pitch of the game is:**\n\n**Think:** Darkest dungeon, you are an estate manager, with a goal in mind and a tavern. (think recruit geralt of rivia whenever you can to help you out) But combat and recruiting is based strictly on the DnD 5e ruleset.\n\n**But:** you have creating freedom in classes and abilities. yep that is the exception with the dnd 5eRS to counteract the evil AI dungeon master.\n\nSome sub-abilities can be tweaked and combined.\n\nAdventurers are recruited, trained and sent on a mission. If they succeed, they gain 1 level FLAT, this is because they are very likely to die.\n\nYou can watch your adventurers team dreaming of heroism and incredible tales falling at the hands of the first group of goblins they encounter,\n\nOr heroically destroy a legendary monster by rolling crits, while being unable to find out how to stop the water from filling up the room they are in, dying of stupidity.\n\nPure bliss..\n\nThe game is not punishing, in fact you can never lose, but winning is hella hard.\n\nI'm probably 80% through the AI code, 15% through in the campain code, 3% in for the art, 0% for the sound design, I want to complete this, but I feel I'll die before it is even half way finished.\n\nIf anyone likes this idea, just ping me, I'm feeling quite bad right now realizing how hard it's going to be. I want to give up. I feel like the idea is really good though, I wont be mad if you steal it.\n\nYou know, working alone on your uniquely challenging game project is kinda soul crushing sometimes."

Text-based MMO,"Probably my silliest idea yet... well after [that](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/kjwvay/a_dungeon_crawler_quite_literally/)\n\nIt basically has everything you usually have in a text adventure game, except that the game will also inform you if another player is in the same area, if you ""face"" in the same general direction as them, or inform you if you ""hear"" another player.\n\nIf another player wants to ""engage"" you, you'll get a message like ""\[Playername\] draws their sword!"". There is a 1 second cooldown after each attack. If you die, you will, naturally, lose your entire inventory.\n\nThere are several classes, split in DPS, tanks and healers. Gear has some importance too, of course.\n\nMoving through a dungeon will be done automatically, unless you either want to move back or are at a crossing. You can see where you are with the help of an asciii drawing representing a ""map"", though.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Everything an RPG/MMO usually has, except in text format."

You can loot satellites for space junk and can grow food/oxygen via greenhouses. What do you think and do you have any better ideas for the gameplay loop as I’m not sure how fun this would actually be in practice. Also I want players to fight but that shouldn’t be all they do.

nsbuql,Base building simulator inside what can only be described as the backrooms.,"Synopsis: You find yourself maintaining a small house that you have recently moved into through estate inheritance. Only you no longer can find the outside door after unpacking your belongings,  and to your horror when you pull the curtains back you discover that the windows only shine light into other dark rooms.  With every inch you advance in this ""thing"" it becomes more incorrect. Doors seem to to only want to open to a another labyrinth of doors, room slowly stop making any sense, dimensions will not mathematically add up, windows doors and furniture will start appearing in places they should not be. This early 1930's architecture has rapidly become less recognizable, It's clear at this point that you're going to need to keep searching to repair your home location, track your progress, and take care of your health and hunger, but advancing further into this architectural ""thing"" Not only confuses your sense of direction but begins to emit a feeling of trespass. This thing is alive and it hates you. Can you get out?\n\n\nAs the synopsis suggests this is a base building psychological horror video game.\n\nTo break things down further you need to be constantly searching through rooms while using specific inventory items that will prevent rooms from changing or from getting lost. Your reasoning for searching these rooms is to gather resources to slowly fortify your central location, maintain food health, in any sort of physical damage you might take along the way. Eventuallyrthrough physical entities or through psychological architecture, the home will become angry enough at your presence to start attacking your home base. \n\nEventually through collecting lore and The point you're discovering certain locations you are guided to collect a specific set of items to create a device that will either allow you to tame the architecture (to an extent) and begin bending it to your will, allowing for deeper more complex devices to be discovered and more dangerous exploration.  \n\nThe devices in question would have functionality as being able to collapse a wall, force pipes to freeze or overheat. Or literally push entire walls forward or backwards. \n\nIn an essence it's a survival craft game where you use tools to manipulate the physical architecture and solve puzzles while adventuring further into more abstract rooms and labyrinths.

nsa987,Heroes in Hiding [Board Game],"This game takes place a generation after a great war between Light vs Dark. After the war ended, the demigod heroes that fought in the war ""retired."" Their holy/demonic artifacts was sealed away, and the heroes themselves hid their war time personas to disappear among the everyday population. Now the Powers of Light and Dark are stirring again, and it is the player's job to reassemble the heroes and recover their artifacts to be ready for the upcoming conflict.\n\nThis will be a turn based board game with 2 players. The play area will consist of a bunch of investigation sites, a Fortress of Light, and a Fortress of Darkness. Each turn the players dispatch their heroes to investigation sites in order to uncover the hero or relics at that location, and if successful return them to their fortress for use in the following rounds and eventually the final battle.\n\nThe game lasts a set number of turns after which the Final Battle occurs to determine the winner. In the Final Battle each faction puts fourth their 5 best heroes armed with their 5 best relics, and they fight until one side is victorious."
ns7pub,An 80s/90s themed Megaman X-like game featuring yo-yos,"I have no idea how to make a video game, but I've had this idea for a while and really just want to put it out there.\n\nSo the idea is for something along the lines of Megaman X. (However, this might be better suited to a metroidvania style game instead) But instead of having a blaster, the main character uses a yo-yo. I envisioned it being something like a whip like in Castlevania.\n\nThe main character is a yo-yo champion who wins a tournament and receives the coveted Golden Yo-Yo. The Yo-Yo is stolen however and the character must venture into a sort of gang-controlled area to fight enemies and work their way up to find the person who stole the Golden Yo-Yo.\n\nThe very first battle is with a cup stacker. After defeating them, your health bar is now a bunch of cups stacked on top of one another. (I liked this idea because cups stacked on top of one another look a bit like the lines in the Megaman health bar.) Finding Golden Cups or something similar throughout the game will permanently raise your total healthbar.\n\nEnemy ideas: Three brothers who each have footwear themed abilities.\n\nThe first brother has roller blades. Defeating him gives you the ability to dash.\n\nThe second bother has light up sneakers. Defeating him give you the ability to dash in the air.\n\nThe third brother has air pump shoes. Defeating him gives you the ability to double jump.\n\nNext set: Three sisters who each have wristwear themed abilities\n\nThe first sister has sweatbands. Defeating her gives you the ability to charge up attacks.\n\nThe second sister has snap bracelets. There are three bracelets: Red, Green, and Blue. You can only equip one at a time, but each one has a different bonus ability. Red gives you better defense. Green lets you move faster. Blue gives you stronger attacks\n\nThe third sister is goth and has spike bracelets. Defeating her gives you the ability to cling to walls and wall jump.\n\nI had some thoughts on a fourth sister who maybe had swatches (those cheap multi-color watches). Defeating her would give you the ability to slow time, but it would need to be charged up. There would need to be some balancing mechanics to keep it from being overpowered. \n\nFinal set: High school archetypes?\n\nA nerd character. Defeating them gives you a pocket protector that would generate a small shield. \n\nA jock character. Defeating them gives you a helmet allowing you to do damage to enemies when you dash into them. \n\nFrom here on I'm less sure about the other bosses. I thought a preppy character would work for the official third, but I'm not sure what ability you'd get from them. The best I could think of was a backstep that lets you jump backwards, but that seems a little weak.\n\nOther possible maybes: The band geek? Your yo-yo now produces little music notes that can do damage. A pretty/ugly girl? She wears glasses, but then then half way through the battle takes them off and becomes prom queen. You get the glasses which lets you see hidden locations?\n\nMost of the regular enemies you fight would be people wielding nerf gunes that shoot darts, balls, etc. The thee sisters area would maybe have Lisa Frank-esque enemies. The guns would also fire glitter that would act like poison. It's basically all the tropes and fads that were popular in the 80s and 90s.\n\nThe final boss is another yo-yo user and uses the Golden Yo-Yo which is very strong."
ns58gp,1v1 RTS where both sides have to influence a neutral side,"It takes place on an interstellar ship where there has been a severe malfunction. Before the match, both sides, the Ship AI (Defending) and the Infestation (Attacking) pick three perks that help them or hinder their opponent to make sure each match is fresh. The Infestation chooses what set off the alarm, whether it be an outbreak of spores or mysterious and seemingly random system failure.\n\nThere are six non-player units called Agents. These agents have a karma system that can be swayed by either side, lower karma makes it easier for the Infestation to influence them and higher karma increases their hate for the Infestation, making it easier for the AI to influence them. Certain actions can generate a boon for either side. There are three classes of boons, Diplomatic, Dominant, and Special. Diplomatic boons provide buffs for the player's team or change an Agent's karma toward the player's team. Dominant boons cripple the enemy team or make it harder for them to influence the Agents.\n\nThink of this as an attack/defend gamemode. The Infestation attempts to gain control over the ship and the Ship AI attempts to follow programing and protect the Agents at all costs. There could also be an alternate game mode where a specialist AI attempts to reclaim an infested ship, a Rogue AI attempts to take over a normal ship or two Infestations fight over turf."

nrl3xn,"WW1 themed game, but you're the animals trying to survive","Most, if not all, games that have the theme of WW1 or WW2 or such are in the perspective of the soldiers or people in charge AKA high command. Very rarely do we even hear about the animals trying to get by during such conflicts.\n\nYou can argue that the animals most likely avoided humans and places where there were humans, but for the case of WW2 for example, it spanned out to multiple different places, sometimes in the remotest of places and as such, animals have fallen between the crosshairs of human weapons.\n\nThe gameplay would be of a survival, where depending on what animal you play as, you do different things but some things stay the same: search for food, find shelter, keep out of danger and optionally, find a mate. What obviously makes this type of survival different is the fact you have to avoid battles, soldiers and bombs for example. Due to battles, food would be scarce, almost nowhere is safe and so on.\n\nI apologise if this idea seems incomplete, I don't have enough motivation to continue writing :P"
nrjd98,Suggestions for my game idea? :D,"Disclaimer : I came up with this idea just yesterday so it's still very rough around the edges. :/\n\n(The game would be isometric 2d, with a gerenal cute aesthetic)\n\nHere's the premise : You're a person living in a world which is inhabited by ghostly creatures (similar to creatures like Totoro or the soot sprites from Ghibli (usually not scary)). The thing is though that whenever you look at them or they look at you, they dissapear / run off. So people have only caught glimpses of them. Your character, believing that they exist has built a robotic flying pet with a polaroid on it (the camera through which you're looking) which allows you to take pictures of them, you can zoom in / move it around a bit when in ""camera mode"" (can only take a limited amount of pictures before having to go buy new film and you only can see the creatures when hidden). Now they don't just appear anywhere, they only appear under very certain conditions (specific time of day, weather, season, place, etc.) and they appear for a short duration (around 2 - 10 seconds). You have a book though from many of the accounts from when people have spotted these creatures and under which conditions they were spotted in (sometimes there'll be an unknown so that it becomes a lot harder to spot them (e.g. the time of day wasn't written down)) Now if you do manage to take a picture, then you can sell that picture in your own photography store. With the money that you make from them you can customize your store / room / character by buying stuff in other shops, buy gifts for other characters, upgrade your camera (different lens filter which is a requirement for some creatures, increase max number of pictures etc), buy a new shop or house at a different location or buy things that'll unlock new places / boost your abilities (e.g. buy a small boat to get across a large body of water or buy a bike to get around faster) I'd want to have a lot of different areas in the game (cities, forests, haunted places, lakes etc.) with creatures that match the given area. The map would be non-linear, (there'll be restricted areas though which you'll need to unlock). Interacting with the npcs will add lore to the creatures / add new accounts to your book.\n\nAnways that was it, thank you for your time and I'd really like to hear what your feedback would be :)"
nrj13z,Zombie survival revolving around a Zombie Civil War,"Starts out typically enough, zombie plague, survivors, etc. However, at some point, the disease mutates and the infected beyond this point are basically just the deceased resurrecting (w/ some drawbacks and added abilities), and leads to 3 factions.  \n\n\n1. Human Survivors: Standard stuff, guns and medikits, co-op, etc. Goal is to outlast the plague and rebuild, but with the plague completely eliminated.  \n2. Shadows: Given additional abilities that make them unique, and are more independent with actual detriments to working with other teammates. Goal is to assist survivors, but also survive themselves, leading to them assisting from the shadows (hence the name) as Survivors would attack them on sight.  \n3. Zombies: Standard fare, swarm mentality and unique monstrous varieties. Goal is to feed, but cannot feed on Shadows, leading to them prioritizing the Survivors and avoiding the Shadows."
nretli,Kingdom Two Crowns + Bad North + Townscaper + RTS,"Game idea: elements of Kingdom Two Crowns, such as progressive expansion, coin collection for outposts secured, day/night cycle where daily income is collected once per day.\n\nElements of Bad North where squads of troops can be recruited, land is in civil war so bands fight in RTS / Roguelike style.  Could include similar premise of northern viking invaders.  I love the Bad North visual aesthetic. \n\nElements of Townscaper where as part of ending a civil war, rebuilding the kingdom, uniting the kingdom and then ultimately defending off the northern invaders you also have the option to upgrade towns and outposts so they expand and could look more decorative or grand as you level the kingdom up.  Could also transition from burnt ruins and smouldering rubbish to beautiful building and gardens, birds, wildlife etc.  There could be a sense of enjoyment from seeing the kingdom blossom again, coming out of civil war.  Again the visual design aesthetics here would be important.\n\nOverarching premise of the game could be that the land is in civil war, the king is dead, lords and barons are vying for leadership, you need to rise up, take control and unite the kingdom under one banner, either through force or influence.  Once you expand enough control as the game progresses more northern invaders arrive and depending on how well you have united the kingdom will determine whether you can hold them off and ultimately win the game.\n\nQuestion is could this be a good game, what appeals, what doesn’t?"
nreaf9,A Fall Guys looking game based on the Calvinball comic strips of yore by Bill Watterson,"I imagine it looking something like fall-guys in terms of character and map coloring as well as character design. Players start the game in a large arena playing a team sport ( Let's say football/soccer because that's one of the more widely known sports). The players and environment interact with the ball in a similar way to rocket league. At first the map is a huge but flat environment that is divided into a couple of sections: The scoreboard and rule board- where a player can check the score and rules. However players can find rulebooks scattered around the maps every now and then. Mixing and matching 7 noun prompts (*all players, your team, the other team, new rule, the ball, the objective,* and *the map*) with 7 descriptive prompts depending on what noun you picked. For example if I pick ""all players"", I am given 6 prompts to pick from that match with ""all players"" (*grow, shrink, can fly, run faster, can die, etc.).* The game ends when the objective is reached. This is unclear so I'll try and clarify in the comments."

In this kinda game, would you want to choose what you say in the rap, or would you rather have lines given to you by the system from which you can pick from?

nrcz9l,"There are NO cavalry-focused games, to my knowledge. Why?","There are games that feature cavalry in a strategic sense, as the total war games do. There are some games like M&amp;B or Battlefield1 where you could be cavalry, but it's not really stealing the show.  \n\n\nWhat I'm thinking is that there are no, and I'm pretty sure it's actually ZERO games that star you, as a character, in third or first-person starring as any sort of cavalry.  \n\n\nPerhaps we could open a discussion on how a game might be created, starring a whole suite of new, interesting momentum-full mechanics, which could really make you feel like a daring dragoon, lancer, mounted knight, or hussar, etc, perhaps rising through the ranks and even controlling your own squadrons of cavalry?  \n\n\nDoes this idea sound interesting? Fun? Do you think it could work, from a mechanical perspective? I would really love to hear the general opinion on this, and I look forward to reading your thoughts!  \n\n\n(Also, I'm new here, I hope the request flair is the right flair to put this under.)"

However, you can collect them again as you move and dodge enemies. Enemies will be designed based on trying to prevent you from getting your bullets back.  The idea is that you should keep a nice balance between how much you shoot and your health.\n\n**Run and gun. You are a smokejumper who falls in a forest consumed by flames.** \n\nFlames have turned this forest's animals into dangerous fire creatures. As a smokejumper, your job is to parachute to the forest. Then, you use your weapons to kill these creatures and put the flames out.\n\n**Roguelike. You enter an exclusive nightclub. The only way to reach the VIP area is to eliminate enemies across floors.**\n\nEnemies' shoot patterns will be synced with the music.

The sword can level up independently of it's host. Attacks can inflict bleed and other status effects, so if you bleed out after killing all enemies in a room it's game over."
nqut60,Poor stories don't make good games,"This is a bit of a rant I want to get off my chest. There are many good games out there whose narrative contain elements of ""poor"" storytelling. At their heart they are great game play mechanics that require narrative contortionism to provide \*affordances to the players. They are not jankey stories that happened to have an enjoyable game play experiences attached to them. The real art of game story writing comes in creating an environment where first time players instinctively know what to do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf a game designers puts the player in a game scifi scene with armed men in red and black uniforms. The player thinks ""they are probably nazis, I should try and kill them before they kill me."" It doesn't matter that visually coding bad guys as Nazi is a lazy story writing trope because it helps the player pick up what the game is expecting of them. In fact leaning heavily on over used tropes is good game design so long as it is in service of helping the player master the game mechanics. This is why it bothers me when I see ""game ideas"" that are all narrative with no discussion the mechanics the narrative there to support.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt bothers me when people post an idea that is essentially bad fan-fic and act like it is the seed of a great game. It bothers me that some people think writing for games is easy because there are so many good games with ""poorly"" written stories. It is pursuit of some surface level detail that is almost useless without the all the stuff underneath.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen children play great games with somewhat cringe stories they talk about the cringe stories because that is the only aspect of the game they have the vocabulary to describe. As we get older I would like to think our vocabulary grows and we can better articulate what about a gaming experience we enjoyed. If we get it in our heads to design a new experience I would like to think  that we also have vocabulary to include more than the surface level narrative details. I have been disappointed in this expectation many times.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\* **Affordances** are properties of objects which show users the actions they can take. Users should be able to perceive **affordances** without having to consider how to use the items."

nqpqj3,A call for flair changes,"**Should be replaced:**\n\n**The scale tags** (Beginner, Intermediate, Experienced, AAA): These tags just take up space and aren't good for much. Nobody uses them and even in the few instances where I have, it's difficult to estimate exactly the scale. Obviously the difference between AAA and Beginner is easy to know but Intermediate and Advanced are hard to gauge.\n\n**Should be added:**\n\n**Tags to sort by genre** (RPG, Visual Novel, Platformer, FPS, etc.): These tags would definitely help me out  and I'm sure there are at least a couple other people on this subreddit who can stand to benefit. I myself prefer to work in a couple specific genres (Platformers, RPG) and it would be nice to find ideas that are only those few genres. Plus it helps to weed out the MMORPGs and MMOs early on.\n\n**Tags to sort by viewing angle** (2D vs 3D): Again I prefer to work in a specific medium of art (pixel art) which means I would take a 2D idea over a 3D one any day. These aren't necessary but I think they would be nice to have.\n\n**IP Tags**: Honestly the worst game ideas on here are the ones that either call for duplicates of an existing game or the ones that involve IPs. You know the ones I'm talking about (""Make a Spider-Man game!"" or ""Make a Doctor Who game!""). These in themselves are not inherently bad but for me a simple rule of thumb is ""If it can't stand without the IP, would seem like a cheap knockoff without the IP, or simply doesn't work without the IP"" then don't post it. Nothing I say is honestly going to stop people from posting these which is why I feel like we should have these tags."

nq4d89,Western MMO (Sun Set At High Noon) SSHN Concept,
nq3t0g,Coffee 2D Platformer,"My concept is you are a cup of coffee, trying to claim your right as the best beverage in the world. The game is presented in a classic pixel art style. The character controls normally, with a double jump &amp; mid-air dash. You would travel through different “levels” in each location, or “world” you visit. There are generally 5-7 levels in each world, filled with different hazards &amp; enemies suiting that location. For example, one level in a cafe’ world could feature bouncing around on computers like springs, while avoiding dangerous coffee stirrer enemies. Ideas for locations could be the aforementioned cafe’, a school, an office, etc. I imagine there would be 4 worlds in the game. At the end of each world, there is a beverage that must be defeated in a unique way. For the cafe’ world, you would fight milk, for the school, you would fight a juice box, &amp; for the office, you would fight an energy drink in a vending machine. Along your adventure, you can collect coffee beans to unlock new skins, which can all be instantly brought with real-world money. Also, if you fail in a stage, you can simply revive by watching an ad. Overall, I think it’s a decent idea, &amp; much more accomplishable that many of the other ideas in this sub. Of course, some things will need to be changed to work, but be sure to tell me what you think. Thanks for reading!"

Everything that would improve survivability. \n\n* Zombies become stronger with every kill. At spawn zombie players are really weak and can only take on recently spawned users with shitty loot (and if they are alone...). With time, the zombie becomes stronger. You get points to spend in a skill tree. More agility, cunning, hearing, smelling, longer jumps, etc. Given enough time you can become a super zombie that terrorizes the entire server.\n&amp;nbsp;\nIdeally, it would be a persistent server where players can hop in and hop out. 50/50 forced distribution of playerbase. Map would have a starting area with the shittiest loot possible where both humans and zombies spawn. Humans need to gtfo of there fast, zombies need to follow to eat them. The farther you are from spawning point the better the loot. That doesnt mean better chances of survability, as humans would like that loot too, and zombies would like your head for breakfast.\n&amp;nbsp;\nThe game would have a ranking with top players sorted by time alive. Server resets after 24h and has a hall of fame for hoever survived the longest. \n&amp;nbsp;\nI need this fking game in my life."

npp3ei,Mobile game concept. Rate please,"It seems to me that humans have ceased to be afraid of nuclear war. Humans are bored with works of art about the consequences of nuclear war. But nuclear war is not the only cause of post-apocalypse. Among them are environmental disasters. One of such problems of our time is desertification, or maybe you have heard the latest news about soil contamination with fungus entailing the risk of the complete destruction of bananas?\n\nLet's imagine. In the near future, a bacterium that destroys fertile soils appeared. Hunger and wars are reducing the population of humanity. The survivors build greenhouse cities in which locusts and algae are grown to feed the population. In the newly formed deserts, where it was once green, they begin to find an unknown substance - a spice - a new drug that improves the harvest of food, when consumed, mental capabilities, endurance increase, digestion improves, but also a strong dependence arises.\n\nThe main character, Garrett, is a driver, picks up the spice in the deserts, lives at the outpost. His old partner, the shooter, was killed by unknown people, and he wants to find out who did it, for this he needs to complete the tasks of the outpost, get spice, improve his cars and kill bosses. And all this with the help of a new partner Janet. The plot is presented as cut-scenes in the form of comics, dialogues while traveling.\n\nAs you might have guessed, the core gameplay is a trip from point A to point B with a top view, battles, finding a way and overcoming obstacles. During the battle, the gunner starts shooting automatically when the enemy hits the weapon's radius of destruction. On the left is the mode of a normal ride at the initial location, here the game only teaches us to ride and entertains us with dialogue. On the right is the battle, the player needs to avoid a situation when several opponents will shoot at him at the same time, for this he needs to choose where to maneuver, otherwise he will be blown up.\n\nMeta gameplay consists of prioritizing mission choices, upgrading the outpost, weapons, and vehicles.\n\nBalance\n\nThe main characteristics of our vehicles are: Speed, Maneuverability, Armor. The faster the car, the less strength. The higher the Armor, the slower the car. Controllability depends on the type of car, its personality. For example: the ""Interceptor"" muscle car is very fast, but poorly controlled.\n\nThe main characteristics of the weapon are: Damage, rate of fire, radius of destruction. Here the situation is as follows: the higher the damage, the lower the rate of fire. The higher the rate of fire, the lower the damage. For example: ""Machine Gun"" has low damage, medium rate of fire and medium radius. The rocket launcher has high damage and low rate of fire, high range.\n\nFor each improvement, points are awarded to certain characteristics, with a certain amount it becomes possible to kill the boss, in this case, about 40 points.\n\n**The moment you've been waiting for: how to make money from it?**\n\nSo, Soft currency is Money: for each killed bandit or enemy, the completed task, the Outpost Chief pays money, with the money we can buy a new vehicle and improve buildings, for example, a warehouse so that it can hold more spices.\n\nHard currency - Spice: in the warehouse, for each load of spices, you can get a loot box with supplies, from which an improvement for an already open weapon or vehicle can drop randomly, the same cannot be dropped again, but parts drop for each vehicle separately.\n\nAdvertising: - It takes time to deliver the supply loot box, which can be shortened by watching advertisements. For further deliveries of supply crates, it is necessary to bring spices. If the player does not want to go for spices, he can directly buy them from the store for real money, upgrade his car and get content faster.\n\nSince the main character does not know who killed his partner, you can add new bosses and locations on our way for a long time, for which a certain type of car is more suitable. For example: you can go to the location ""mud swamp"" only by a car with a caterpillar track. For the ""freeway"" location, a muscle car is better suited. Location ""quicksand"" - hovercraft. Ruins is a machine with a bucket to push obstacles apart."
npow3g,diverse bio-mecha,"I was thinking about how you could make humongous mecha a little bit less stupid, and my diseased brain spat out this wonky idea;\n\nAlien super science is used to create mammalian hybrid meat suits - basically meaty power armour. Making them bigger increases the power of the native weapons systems which are based on the same gravity bending magic tech that makes them fly, and mitigates the cube squared law, but they can only bend the cube squared law so far, so the smaller ones have a lower top speed but can change direction faster, making them better at melee.\n\nFor a bit of extra weird, you could also have low power suits that have just enough power to fly, a little bit, and huge eyes and ears, for sniper and recon work.\n\nFor a lot of extra weird you could have suits within suits, like a Russian doll.\n\nFor anime level weird, you could make the title ""Russian Dolls"", and make the pilots Russian school girls.\n\nOf course you're thinking ""Wouldn't the big ones be based on whales, so they don't have to carry limbs around?"". That's what I thought too, but I think that mapping a whale shaped body to a human brain would be too tricky, especially when you try to integrate the senses. I can't imagine the human brain could handle that..\n\nI'm thinking of using this in a space opera, but I would be stoked to see it in a game.\n\nHope you all enjoy the nightmares."

ob8h5l,A WWII era naval aviation RTS game,"The core mechanic is like this: in a 1 vs 1 skirmish on an open sea, you and your opponent each have a carrier fleet, and you win by destroying the other's carrier. Generally speaking, it is sorta like a hybrid between the old RTS carrier in World of Warships and Battlestations Pacific (and the aviation is a bit like the old Navy Field). \n\nThe basic classes/elements are： \n\nCarriers: the heart of the fleet, which allows squadrons to land/take off. Recycling the aircraft is kinda like manufacturing units in conventional RTS, except that the carrier can only perform one task at a time. For example, returning aircraft cannot land when another squadron is taking off from the carrier. It is intentionally designed to be the skill factor in the game. \n\nOther surface vessels: these include cruisers and destroyers. Their tasks are quite similar, either to escort the fleet or to scout or to possibly rescue the pilots from nearby ditched aircraft. Unlike in many naval simulators, their attack interaction is just point-and-click. Cruisers can also launch seaplanes for reconnaissance or rescue missions. Cruisers can provide excellent artillery support and antiair, while destroyers have good mobility and long-range torpedo power (and also AA). Since battleships cannot provide any unique gameplay, it is intentionally omitted. \n\nAttack aircraft: these include dive bombers, torpedo bombers, and fighters. Fighters are counter to all aircraft while dive bombers and torpedo bombers are the most efficient against surface ships. Fighters can tag after enemy aircraft for extra damage. This is one of the skill factors. Dive bombers are good against all surface ships, and torpedo bombers play strategic roles by dropping torpedos to break fleet formation. All units can be promoted after dealing enough damage to the enemy. \n\nPilots: After a plane being shot down, its pilot will appear near the vicinity of the crash site. After being successfully rescued, the pilot will immediately return to the carrier. This mechanic is designed to prevent having few planes in the late game from happening. Also, survived pilots can retain their ranks. \n\nWeather and environment: There will be different types of clouds in the game, providing unique concealments and vision advantage. For example, cumulus cloud can hide surface ships underneath from being detected by aircraft, and nimbostratus will damage any entering aircraft while the carrier underneath will also be inoperable. These are supposed to be the substitutes for terrain from normal RTS games. There are also 2 discrete altitudes for aircraft, and aircraft have different performance and visibility at the altitudes. For example, they can gain speed by diving, to escape from tagged fighters. \n\nThe essence of it is to have an RTS game with exclusive naval elements, instead of a naval simulator, so historical accuracy shouldn't be the main point. It can probably recreate historical naval campaigns, although with less accuracy and more fun. Ideally, it should be a multiplayer game, but considering the necessary costs, it is also OK if there are only LAN matches (or PvE campaigns). \n\nI have been working on this independently for quite a while, using Unity 2D. However, it is extremely tedious to correctly model ship movements (and pathfinding) using the built-in physics, so I was thinking of moving to Unigine which has gorgeous support for water physics and volumetric cloud. But if I do decide to migrate to a different engine, then I definitely need a team. \n\nHere is a concept UI that I previously created:  https://imgur.com/lb0PDnx \n\nI'm not a native speaker, so pardon me for my English :)"
ob7h40,What would be fun to do while exploring a somewhat realistic Solar System in the future?,"I've been thinking about making my own space game for a while.  Specifically, one with realistic orbital mechanics (likely N-Body simulation, similar to what you would expect from Kerbal Space Program).  I've actually done a fair amount of spacecraft simulation as a part of my academic research and I've built a couple prototypes of this in Unity, so I have a pretty good feel for the base mechanics.  \n\nIdeally, I want exploration to be a big part of it.  I think it would be fun to explore the solar system in the future and see what kinds of cool space stations and other points of interest are out there.  What I've yet to decide though, is what else is there will be to do.  I'm sure people will get bored if all there is to do is just fly around so I'd like some mechanic or gameplay loop to encourage players to explore.\n\nI suppose one of the obvious things to do would be to add some kind of combat, but that feels like that would inevitably cause a ton of feature creep.  Its a lot of work to get a combat system with enough depth to be as engaging as I would want.  My other immediate thought was trading, but that not really give much incentive to visit moons and asteroids that have no space station.\n\nSo in any case, I'm interested to see what you guys think."
ob6lsz,A game I thought of or someone has made,"so I was hoping for people to help me with something there is a game that has been floating around my mind for years now and now it's really kicked up when I thought about it more during COVID so my idea is if people are familiar with the parts in Bioshock 2 the annoying little sister part where you have to guard them as much as you can so you can get eve but I started to see it differently now what if it was in VR or just a pc FPS and made it the main focus for a game so say there is co-op for this game one is the shooter and the other is the medic ""or whatever the scenario is"" the shooter gets no bounds can put traps search for ammo cases and health injections in case the medic has been pinned and is unable to do their work properly as for the medic though they can see what is not necessary for the shooter. crafting materials they will search a little harder for these materials because they are extremely small items but if they find a good amount of these items they can get a screen to choose what they can construct (depending on the amount of resources) and help the shooter even if they are working through their current objectives Examples: deployable healing stations that are throwable,  shootable healing syringes to heal the shooter from a far, or extra healing syringes to be shared between the shooter and the medic. now after preparation stage is done the medic and the shooter are locked in a bubble worth of distance for the siege stage but this is where RNG needs to take place unless you've set up properly and paid enough attention to the area the RNG part is where the spawn of the enemies will come through first usually the amount will be around 30-40 enemies but if you set up properly the amount will either be cut in half or 2/3's of it. now for the actual game the shooters main priority is to guard the medic even if it costs him dying at the end of the round (the medic can still get them up but the revive will make the job for the medic harder \[injects/stations only heal not revive\]) the shooter has a limited amount of weapons due to them picking what they wanted for the rounds what I'm thinking is along the lines of main weapon: assault rifle, shotgun, sniper rifle Secondary: another rifle, pistol, knife, grenade launcher. the medic has two objectives one is working on the patient that is un conscious in the middle of the bubble and escape with the patient (like I said the shooter can die at the end) now the medic has multiple tools in their arsenal but that is what makes their movement speed halved compared to the shooter the medic only has one weapon but can choose between a variety of pistols from slow and hard hitting to spammable and weak but the items they will always have is their syringe gun, their bag or case of first aid, and a simple scalpel. the first aid is well equipped with several tools and all the medic has to do is cure the patient from whatever wounds, infections or even scrapes and bruises(early easy levels) the procedure is very simple the only main factor is the enemies harming them or the patient if the patient gets hurt there is several more problems to work through if the medic gets hurt they have a harder time with their vision telling different injections from others even using different tools from what is needed for the situation or the rare case of having to operate on yourself bruises scratches even wounds. that would be it for the main stage now the escape stage this part is simple there is a random part of the map which will be labeled as the exit unless the shooter or even the medic found it during the preparations stage however the exit is the same place where the spawner is so not only does the shooter need to keep the medic and the patient alive but they have to push through wave after wave of enemies using careful positioning for the medic then communicating to them if the area is safe or not or if it is the right direction for the exit. The game is only over if the medic and the patient have made it through the exit. (bonuses to the game, if the shooter escapes with them the medic and shooter earn special rewards like cosmetics for their weapons or new weapons for other levels, the game will not be only medic and shooter I've put more thought into it and was hoping for different gamemodes something like engineer and wall/ceiling turrets, or the medic is currently operating on the shooter, or a duo type of thing where the medic has some of their utilities but the shooter has some of them too and have to coordinate for who takes over medic job) either way this is an idea but I want help with everyone checking if this is already a game and I'm just remembering something instead or an idea unique enough to try to bring to life thanks reddit. (PS this is a repost because I noticed I don't know how reddit works so I tagged it to my private profile and pinned it there, so oops)"

oanais,Tribalism,"2d, top down perspective, you start out as a single unit, rock in hand, spawned at random somewhere in a massive procedurally generated world with occasional trade stations scattered about. the world is teeming with player and a.i. life.\n\nGet bots by: hiring wild people, the slave trade, breeding.\nUse them to: hunt, fish, gather, trade, build tools/structures, fight, tame horses and tend to live stock.\nGive orders and watch as your tribe turns into a village or even a city, the only limit is the resources.\nSend out scouts and claim new lands, but you'll have to fight for the good spots.\n\nPlayer interactions: a huge part of the game will be scarcity of resources. Snowy areas don't get much food, deserts don't get much water, grass lands don't have alot of trees. So trade or war will become necessary to get more stuff.\n\nThe tech tree: set aside someone to do research and learn new tech that will let you get an edge. Basic tools to black smithing. Animal husbandry to calvary and the wagon.\n\nThe goal: become the biggest tribe by the end of a 1 month period, then server wipes and it's back to square one."
oambnn,Unity C# MMORPG Development Live Stream,[removed]
oamaee,Just a Stream of Conciousness," So, let’s go with this. Everybody wants to be creative in some way, at least I think they do. For me, there were different ways of expressing this. I did acting, I liked to write short texts about fantasy or romance not like this, and of lately I enjoy the art of game development. Before you wonder, no, I haven published anything yet, probably because it’s been too little time for it. I got into it about one years ago right after graduating school. Happily, I have friends with similar interests even if our expertise differs. So, what am I thinking about right now? I’ll need to give you a short background.\n\nI’ve always enjoyed the grind. Whether I was playing an MMORPG or a shooter. I loved those repetitive things, on each round getting faster by just a little bit or finding a new shortcut or exploit. Still, I never got into speed running. Too much pressure. But exploration and survival soon got into my spectrum of favored game experiences. That’s why I played games like ARK or Dark Souls. So yeah.\n\nLet’s get into what I am imagining as a game. Multiple experiences from other games have influenced my vision. The basic concept is, as to now be expected, an open world survival game. But wait, there are all too many out there already. In this day in age, you need something special about your pitch that people get interested. ARK already gave us dinosaurs, Sea of Thieves ocean and sailing, Day Z zombies and post apocalypse, Minecraft building, Satisfactory organization and planning, MMORPGs leveling as well as equipment and classes, Subnautica diving, No Mans Sky the entire universe, other games gave us genres like steampunk or medieval, worlds with deserts, forests, jungles, oceans, swamps, mountains, plains and even more, fantasy worlds, floating islands, reverse waterfalls, moons, outer space, monster dungeons and so much more. Yes, that sentence was far too long. Unbelievably many options, most worth at least dipping into. Important example, probably the dream of any gamer and company as well, the world of Ready Player One. Endless… well everything. S\*\*\*, I got sidetracked. Ok the game. As I said/wrote, open world, survival. Fantasy monsters like the Displacer Beast, but also real ones like the Pangolin. Not only that but even dinosaurs, or even cooler ones, Tuk’ata from Star Wars, Hydras from human myths and legends, my boar sleep paralysis demon. Everything. I want the player to be able to do anything they want. Within their ability of course. You wont start with armor or weapons. Get the grind on. When you cut a tree, you wont instantly have “100” wood. You’ll have to cut the pieces you need out of it. Explore, find out where you can mine ore. Enough.\n\nLike everybody I know that this is impossible and let’s be real. Fing boring. Can’t develop such a game, even I don’t want to play it. It’d be tedious, impossible for the nowadays average person, unpractical without proper VR, I’m talking real full dive stuff. Thanks for listening and getting disappointed together with me :)"
oak41y,Coordinated Assault FPS,"I thought up a game called Coordinated assault where there is an attacking and defending team. The attacking team must enter the building and kill all defenders or complete the objective. defenders must hold their ground and wipe out the hostiles or protect the objective. the members of each side will vote on a path they will take (ex. everyone goes around the building and all enter at different points or they can have two man squads so fights will be easier)to try to out smart the enemy to win. in combat everyone can killed with one shot to the head, any other shot will deal damage and will deal bleeding damage over time. There is no natural healing operators can stop bleeding by applying bandages to shot areas and stim shots will heal and grant a speed boost."
oajzom,I have a game idea I thinks good but want some opinions on it,"It’s a open world zombie game with settlement building so the game starts with the main character just going about his day as someone who works a job the player will be given the option what job they start like office worker, fireman etc but you go through your normal job for 1 and a half days after 1 day of that then you go to work the next day then halfway through the day all hell let’s loose and you have to fight through the streets to get home and barricade your house depending on what job you have the time to get home differs cause they’d be located at different points in the city each job has it’s different pros and cons and that’s about as far as I thought this through"

oahy24,Some (probably not so) great idea for games,"Ok, so I got some ideas for games and you all will probably hate me( jokes on you, my Hate mail box is full) bear with me, it's just concepts.\n\nMyst for VR. Explore an unusual world and uncover secrets in quiet zen using your hands to discover hidden traps, tomes, messages left behind, operate strange machinery. \n\n TF2 style FPS but with magic and wizards instead of guns and super soldiers. Let the mayhem commence!\n\nCourting Danger: A Dresden Files game by Telltale games. Self explainitory for anyone who reads the books.\n\nMEGAS XLR for VR. Sit in the driver's seat for the ultimate ride, pilot the Mechanized Earth Guard Assault System and use all the absurd yet awesome power you shoved inside to slash, bash, and body slam the idiots who need to learn that nobody wrecks your town, (record scratch) er, except for you. Tutorial is smashing the DMV.\n\nPretator game done like Evolve. Four humans take on a Yautja hunter in a bloody game of hunter or prey. Be the pretator, upgrade your arsenal, build experience and gather information of the area to level up, or be the humans, specialists from all over the globe using cryo guns, flame throwers, long range or guns akimbo to take down the dangerous alien. \n\nXCOM style turn based tactical game adaptation of StarCraft II: Heaven's Devils.Set years before the events of StarCraft. \nSynopsis:\n          Follow Jim Raynor as he begins his career as a soldier enlisting in the Terran Confederacy to pay for his family to live on in peace. Joining the 351st colonial rangers you command the craziest squad on Taraxis II. Use guns, bombs, flamethrowers, experimental exo suits, and good old fashioned fists to win the war, and get paid. Only, be sure to know who your enemies are. Even if they fly your colors. \n\nXCOM style X-Force game\nSynopsis:\nJoin the X-Force and do the jobs nobody will thank you for. Make a crew and take on radical groups trying to eliminate or subjugate mutants, metahumans, and aliens trying to live quietly. Use (90's extreme)big guns,  mutant powers, and chimichangas to get the job done. \n\n3rd person Wonder woman game set on Themiscyra.\nSynopsis:\nDiana recieves a mysterious call that leads her to the home of the Island of the Amazons, despite nobody being able to return. Only things have changed. The Amazon warriors who fiercely guarded the land have disappeared, creatures of multiple pantheons have nested everywhere, the land itself has changed as ancient secrets refuse to be buried any longer. \nDiana must scour the land to seek answers. She gathers items of power to combat an increasingly dangerous land. \nThankfully there to provide assistance (for the right price) is a surly Welsh wizard and a giant man plant who could give a fig about matters of the Red.\nGameplay should be similar to GoW. Grab gear, get better skills, explore, and kill giants, gods, and unspeakable horrors.\n\nRed Hood Uprising\n\nSimilar to Batman Arkham, but with more depth and usage of the Nemesis system (which WB owns, for some reason)\nSynopsis:\nSet three years after the events of Batman: Arkham Knight, the Batfamily as the tabloid have dubbed them, have taken the role of protectors of Gotham city and Bludhaven. You are Jason Todd, the red Hood. Ruthless vigilante and red sheep of the family. When the criminals don't fear the bat, they fear him and his death sentence. \n               Things have evened out, gone quiet. Jason has taken to systemically dismantling the systems that incentivize normal people to turn to crime, in this instance, it's taking down black mask....again. frustrating as it was to find he'd been taking down body doubles the entire time, his brief war is about to end. That's when you receive a urgent call from Oracle for a meeting with everyone. Jason laughs knowing they don't want him there and don't need him. One hot action packed minute later, Black mask is kneeling, screaming his defiance futility. But laughs as he says ""Underlife is going to drag you down, kid. Wish I could see the bat cry when he sees our boss beat you all down"". Bang. You arrive at the meeting point to find a scene of carnage. Blood, explosions, and strange energy. The bat family, the little you have left, has been stolen. The message left behind is from someone calling themselves the true Arkham Knight.\n         Taking to the road you carve a path of conquest, taking up the title of crime lord, taking over all the gangs in the US, leaving no stone unturned. The Red hood gang goes up against the mysterious Underlife that seems to have taken over everything. Add the business of the All caste, court of owls, and more as you do whatever it takes to find the few good souls willing to help Gotham, his home turn a new leaf come hell or high water.\n        Gameplay includes certain maps that call for disguise(as Matches Malone or his son Trey), that stealth that Batfans love, tactical takedowns, leading strike teams to take over compounds, hand to hand and/or sword combat and Freeplay where you choose how to take down targets. Suborn and subjugate gang leaders, mercenary bands, and rival violet vigilante groups to advance.team up with fellow Outlaws and Outcasts and make enemies of powerful groups like the justice league or the legion of doom (indirectly). Upgrade your hardware, including the helmet, allowing better gameplay, information gathering, tactical analysis and command.  You're choices do affect gameplay as you can choose to be a ruthless vigilante, creating mayhem and death, ruling with fear, or choose to be the hero people need, save lives and be the successor to Batman, even if the cost is high."
oahumy,"Designing a mini golf game, course ideas?","Basically I’m looking for ideas for mini golf courses.\nI want both normal and crazy out of this world ideas. Also if you have any mechanics that might be fun add those in too (think boosts, portals, canons you can get shot out of, etc). \n\nHere are some course I game up with to give you an idea:\n- A basic forest just to learn the ropes of the game\n- Course built atop multiple skyscrapers\n- Golf but in space (gravity can be turned on and off)"
oafzn1,Turok in a Soulsborne format,"Basically what I'd like to see is a third-person action RPG sharing the setting of the Turok games where the player would have to face off against not only mobs of standard dinosaurs but also against dino-humanoids similar to those in Turok: Evolution. While I know that gunplay is a central part of the Turok series, I feel as though there is an opportunity to retcon a good bit of established lore, as non cohesive as it currently is, and reworking the available tech and setting to promote more grounded gameplay.  \n\nIt should include bows and arrows, bolas, spears, knives, stone clubs, tomahawks, etc. in addition to the more interesting equipment produced by the Dinosoids, such as the Dark Matter Cube, Chronoscepter, etc without turning it into a third-person shooter. By making the availability of magic and genetic variation a central part of what makes the Dinosoids and other dinosaurs uniquely threatening as opposed to making advanced technology the focal point is what will allow for more unique enounters and enemies than in previous games.  \n\nWhile Ark Evolved certainly covers a large umbrella in regards to a dino-based video game, there is room to pay homage to a franchise that I owe credit to from my formative gaming years. I'm certain that ""This game but make it soulslike"" is suggested a lot on this and other subs but I sincerely doubt anyone has yet to suggest being a Native American warrior slashing up dino-mutants in recent years. The last Turok we got was in 2008, and it wasn't great, but I believe the franchise could really benefit heavily from this sort of gameplay."
oadt8x,Find the AI in an online text chat,"I had this idea with my friends a few days ago - I think we're at the level where AI can actually be quite deceiving as far as typing in a human fashion, and it'd be interesting if someone made a simple text chat game where there is one AI and a bunch of anonymous players. Maybe it's with friends, or maybe you drop in with a few random people and an AI. It could be quickfire matches that are 2 minutes long, or maybe a longer elimination style. I'll leave the rest of the details up to anyone that thinks this is a good concept, though I have a bit more I can add.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n I wish I knew how to work with AI and game development! If this ever gets made, or anything similar is created, I'd love to try it out. I am putting this in intermediate, though it is a very simple concept, as I think you would need to know how to create or implement quite a complex AI for it to be fun."

oa9vnl,Give me a game idea!,[removed]
oa954o,The Last Of Us - beckon call,"I thought about which studio this game idea could be created by and the only logical one would be naughty dog. with its impressive story telling, next level graphics and hard hitting subject matters. \n\nthis game would be set in the last of us universe and is a spin off to the 2 mainline games.\n\nPremise - a man in his early 30s (Floyd) is forced to venture across the u.s in hopes to find a safe heaven after his community was attacked by poachers (this can be an already established gang or group we have seen in the last of us games before). they kill everyone including women, children and his little brother max. on his journey across the country to find this community he finds peter  a 21 year old down syndrome boy, who Floyd grows a strong bond with through out the game.\n\nthis game will be in the same universe as the last of us and will still have the same looting, combat and physics mechanics as the last 2 games and even uncharted.\n\nwhat makes this game special is that peter is not subject to violence, he hid while his family were all killed by the undead. this brings me onto the main reason for the title ""beckon call"" every time that Floyd gets into a confrontation there will always be somewhere peter can hide, as if Floyd is protecting peter most of the game.\n\nthe game will deal what its like to be disabled in the apocalypse, it will deal with the mental health side of loosing the people closest to you and feeling to blame. peter and Floyd both could've done more to save their family's in their own eyes  which makes then a perfect match up.\n\nthe game as if said previously will include Floyd looking after peter, this will include teaching him how to survive, to fight, to climb and to swim. most of these surviving techniques will be forced upon them as you know naughty dog has always got some made action scene going on sometime or another in their new releases. \n\nI do have a fully fledged idea for the story and even though this is just on a reddit page i dont want to spoil anything for this kind of idea in the future, who knows. if anyone lives this idea enough let me know and ill think more into it.\n\nI'm closing a story like this is right up naughty dogs street, they have become very with the times lately and I believe that representation of down syndrome and other subject matters like this are not touched on enough. id also like to add that this idea is based off a great film called peanut butter falcon, it doesn't have death or gore or zombies but its my inspiration for this post so go give it a watch.\n\nthanks for reading - Jake"
oa61s6,Discord bot minigame ideas,"Hello! I'm currently trying to implement minigames in my Discord bot, but I'm running out of ideas. Has any of you guys got any? Thank you!"
oa53c5,Inverted 4X,"This is a simple concept I thought of while playing MOO2.\n\nA backwards 4X.\nInstead of building up an empire your civilization starts out at an advance state, with lots of tech, units, and territory at your command.\n\nThe twist, however, is that shortly after starting your civilization draws the ire of an unstoppable enemy.\n\nThe rest of the game sees you fighting a losing battle against overwhelming odd. There is no ""winning"" in this game (that should be clear from the outset) only seeing how long you can hold, how many of your people you can save and, what you're willing to do to survive.\n\n\nI just find the concept of inverting the entire flow of the genre intriguing. You start at full power and get weaker over time. You really have to think ahead knowing the same resources won't be there later.\n\nAll the 4X tent poles should be there: diplomacy, research, trade, etc just with a more desperate, fatalistic tone."
oa4sas,Dead space underwater,"Crash land on an ocean planet. End up in an underwater facility. Underwater sequences replace zero gravity sequences. Weapons include things such as harpoons, an ice ray of sorts, an electro gun, maybe a net gun? Anything that fits well in a water scene. Now I’ve played and completed 1 and 2 so I’m not sure but can animals get turned into necromorphs too? If not this is probably redundant but if so it would be cool to see necromorph crabs, octopus, sharks, jellyfish, lobsters etc. Similar to the way a xenomorph’s form is altered depending on what animal was it’s original host. Does the game need to star Isaac Clark? Not necessarily. Forgive me if he dies in dead space 3 I’ve yet to play it but will get around to it. I think the game could be an opportunity to design some groundbreaking underwater sequences/physics also. It could really up the standard for that sort of thing."
oa3sqf,Business Empire,"A semi open world rpg business game. Ultimate goal is to build a business empire.\nYou travel the world to find new businesses/profitable items. Invest in other's businesses or start your own, invest in properties or stock market. You either lose or make money. There will be a balance between personal life and work life. The looks of the characters would change as per the tension levels( like the character has lost a lot of hair or become fat if he doesn't take care of himself) \nAnyone played such a game? Or would be interested? Any ideas you can add?"
oa3oiv,Delirium - horror game idea!,"Here is my idea for a horror game. I accept all the constructive criticism and hope you like it.\n\n**DELIRIUM**\n\nThis game is weird: a horror (non open-world) game with side-quests. So basically you play as Desmond, a crazy person who is held in a abandoned mental hospital because he was forgotten there. He finds out that the person who intentionally forgot him (and other 30 characters ) there is his uncle, Magnus. The side-quests are something like ‘go and find me that thingy’ type of quests, but some of them have misteries in them, like to find the origins and story of your family. The story begins by Desmond waking up in a hospital, you soon find out that Magnus (your uncle) trapped you and 30 characters here for experiments. Your main enemies are weird creatures with human feet and pig head and chest. (I didn’t polish this story too good). You won’t have jumpscares in this game, better yet, the game will play with your mind (that’s why it’s called Delirium). You will go trough long hallways that will go longer and longer as you pass trough them and you will have climbing abilities (like in ac games). You will have to set your own group of survivors to fight your way into the lab of Magnus, only to find your uncle dead. There are three endings:\n\n*The good one:* where you die peacefully shooting yourself with Magnus’ gun.\n\n*The bad one:* where you die eaten by those human-pigs hybrids (i’ll take about them lately)\n\n*The Neutral/Secret one:* where you escape the mansion but leave your friends behind.\n\nHybrids: there are lots of them, Magnus was a crazy guy: human-pigs, bird-humans, dog-humans, wolf-humans, and Harge.\n\nHarge is a type of hybrid more strong that the other, some kind of boss.\n\nPlot twist: this didn’t actually happen, the survivors were other crazy men, the hybrids were the staff and Magnus was your brother, and you actually killed them. Then you shoot yourself escaping this nightmare when you realised what you’ve done.\n\nOverall, hope you like my horror game idea!"

o9z3h8,Cat wrestling game?,"Okay so I was in rural Iowa. The house I was at had a cat family of a Dad, a mom, and 5 kittens. I saw the kittens wrestle so much (just lighthearted messing around). It was actually interesting watching how they moved around in ""combat"", which got me thinking.. this sounds like a game! I would call it ""Fun Fighting with Furry Friends"" or something. You start out as the runt of the litter. You can choose different difficulties. Easy is 3 other siblings, medium is 5, and hard is 7. Now, you get in wrestling ""matches"" with your siblings. As the runt of the litter you need to be agile and tactical since all of your siblings are bigger then you. You use the controllers for front paws, and the side button to ""bite"" (note, not a hard bite, just a little nip, which the real cats do). How ypu defeat a sibling is.. you make them run away. You also have stamina which gets depleted the longer you fight and the more you wrestle around. Yeah this is just a random thought. (Meant for a quest 2)"
o9xm6l,idea,"ok so this might be crazy but hear me out. it would be super cool if there was a stealth game with both rts and platformer mechanics. so, like, for each mission you try to recruit teamates and you put them in place, and after that it's just a stealth platformer(similar to mark of the ninja), but you need to manage your teamates? and then each mission needs more teamates? i dunno, im marking this advanced because enemy AI in stealth games is usually tough. let me know what you thing!"
o9nhio,Fighting game where you control 2 fighters simultaneously,"It wouldn't be a team fighter. It wouldn't be like Ice Climbers in Smash. It wouldn't be like swapping characters mid-fight like in Marvel vs Capcom.\n\nInstead, you'd pick two characters on the character select screen. For Xbox Controls:\n\n* X/Y are character 1's light/heavy attacks respectively\n* A/B are character 2's light/heavy attacks respectively\n\nYou would control the character in front with your other character following behind. Whichever character that attacked last would be in the front.\n\nWith this idea, you don't need large special move lists to memorize. Instead you could have pretty basic stuff, but with more depth; character 1 could use their light attack, character 2 uses their light attack, and then character 1 ends the combo with a heavy.\n\nYou only take damage when the character in front is hurt, and you can't hurt the character in the back. That in itself could have some cool ideas; imagine you're playing a light glass cannon like Sonic (Smash) then you have Bowser (Smash) in the back. If you end a combo with Bowser, he'd be in the front, making you slower and giving you a bigger hitbox. But if you end an attack with Sonic, he's in the front, making you faster with a smaller hitbox.\n\nI imagine this would also make the game less stale. Get tired of playing your main? That's alright, make him your second fighter since you know his moves and try a new character out in the front."

o9n8pk,Fire-based FPS where you absorb killed players,"**General Principles**\n\n* Everyone is made out of fire ([Like this](https://64.media.tumblr.com/c15d8e7674142ad7199ff0f9786fc6dd/tumblr_pt5p4fD7FM1ua8hvwo1_1280.png))\n* If you shoot another player, they turn into a wealth of fire on the ground. You can run up to this fire and then hit a button to absorb it\n* Absorbing fire gets you points, more HP and makes you larger. Like agar.io\n\n**Expanding on Principles**\n\n* More HP and larger size means that players can see past cover and take more bullets to get knocked down, so you can stay on the top of the leaderboard.\n* Likewise, your larger size means that players don't have to hunt you down and can team up to take you out. It keeps it fair.\n* You could hit a button to release your flames, decreasing your size but giving back some health (if you've taken damage)\n* Downing a player that has absorbed lots of flames still drops their flames, but only a fraction. That way once the big guy on top of the leaderboard gets downed, you don't have someone to instantly take his place.\n\n**Smaller Ideas**\n\n* Players have multiple weapons made of fire. They can pull these weapons out of their bodies.\n* You could maybe customize your pretty basic fire guy with different perks, such as **more mass per flame** or **faster movement.** You'd also need different weapons like **rifles** and **shotguns**, but probably not snipers (since you'd have to approach flames to absorb them. Maybe **hunting rifles?**)"

o9mtsy,Brain-sim,"I’m a neuroscientist with 1 year of unity development. My dream is to build a game that teaches you how your brain works. The idea is that you are a mad scientist and you want to create life in a Golem/doll. You find a book with j structure how to make it alive. The player, by following the instructions,  inserts the neurons one by one. First, the player creates basic circuits and later use then them to create gradually more complex circuits. First you connect spinal cord neurons to muscles, later connecting sensory areas to the brain, then you create some brain parts, connect then together and so forth. You also train its brain to live in an environment (eg search food, navigate, search mate, etc). All the circuits are based on real neuroscientific research, and likely represent how it actually happens in your brain. You can even go crazier and make monsters with extra hands or eyes, as long as you make them with appropriate neural circuits. You can then let them interact with each other in the world. The problem is that this project is too big for me alone. From your guys experience is this a good idea to pitch to a AAA company and how (if possible) I should go about it."

o9a0ih,Help please,"I have been watching tortials and I am starting to work on a game, the idea is literally fighting in the sky. You can punch people through buildings and hide behind clouds.

o95kua,Foresight in combat oriented rpg,"Greetings everyone, I was wondering how to implement the gift of foresight in combat oriented/3rd person game with rpg elements?

Thanks for your time!"
o95gwx,Rebels vs big army RTS idea,"Im thinking top down camera style where you would control single soldiers that you cold form into squads, with a very large map but small scale battles, think a rebellion where the rebels would fight this larger army so they would engage smaller bits and pieces of this larger army trying to tie them down into places where the rebels are at the advantage. And the large army would not be able to comb the entire map due to its size so the rebels could move around.  \nThink Men Of War Assault Squad 2 but the maps are WAY bigger and both sides are not equal in numbers so as an example lets say that the large army has to get a truck onto the other side of the large map.\n\n(I say rebels and large army as examples it could be like a massive army versus a smaller army fighting asymetrically)\n\n  \nThey could decide to go off-road with more choices where to go but slower, there would be more places for the rebels to hide and it would be harder to take down traps or they could take the road which is faster and does not have that many places to hide and harder to hide traps but has quite a clear way to know exactly where the truck is going\n\nThe rebels could have hidden bases that could be burned or destroyed if the larger army finds them and decides its worth it to destroy them\n\nBoth sides would have a threat system that if the bigger army takes too much action against rebels lets say burning down a village with a rebels base in it it would generate threat for the larger army so more people would join the rebels but if the rebels take too drastic actions public opinion would turn against them and people would not join the rebels, but lets say the bigger army has generated a lot of threat so people would see it as just that the rebels respond in kind this would go both ways  \nso you could get a massive head start as the bigger army to strike down the rebels but if they survive the people would be riled up that this massive army came to crush a small resistance pocket and burned everything they owned at the same time so the people would be more likely to join the rebellion and would see it as somewhat ok to destroy that tank thats next to that house that would be destroyed when the tank explodes\n\nyou could throw in things like the rebels buying outside support and trying to blend into the ranks of the bigger army so that the bigger army would have to think if the soldiers they sent out would be betrayed by their tank crew and destroyed so the bigger army would have to check loyalty by lets just say running an investigation on certain squads\n\nthis would be balanced by certain soldiers not being able to be corrupted by the rebels such as say an squad made up from extremely patriotic people.\n\nalso you could have basically hero units with the squads you worry most about keeping a watch on them so that they would not dare rebel against you.\n\nyou would get units by basically requisitioning them from higher command and when you order a squad or vehicle every unit from that squad gets the same trait so that lets just say you get a squad that is very patriotic every squad member would have the trait patriot and would not be able to fall to the rebellion, some traits would be very rare to get randomly but you would be able to requisition certain traits from higher command and the rarer the trait the harder it would be to get a squad with that so it would take longer and be more expensive.\n\nunits would keep their traits if re-asinged to another squad but units would work better being in a squad that they have fought in for a very long time, you could call this something like ""squad cohesion"" if you make a squad with soldiers from other squads you would start off from very low squad cohesion which would make the squad not as good in the beginning but as they fight together they gain higher cohesion so at some point they're like a well oiled team work machine\n\nit would work the same for the rebels but they would have different units with different specialities so that for the bigger army you would be able to get a flamethrower squad but for the rebels you would get a molotov squad and since a well used molotov can be more powerful that a flamethrower or a badly used flamethrower can end in disaster it would become somewhat balanced\n\nthen for the rebels getting better gear would be more expensive than for the bigger army but the bigger army would have to be way more careful with the gear that they get due to the destructive power it poses\n\nkeep in mind that this is very early and basically i just wrote what's on my mind and what could be a very fun game that if done well could bring in quite a large crowd of people intrested in RTS games  \nand everything here can be changed but the core of big clunky army vs small nimble army would keep its shape. And if you read untill here i am very surprised and thanks :)"
o9144h,Good mechanic?,"So it's on mobile so you use your left hand to send away knifes by swiping at the direction you want them to hit. The mechanic to shoot will require skill and will not be very easy.\n\n And on the other side you use your right hand to swipe up from 3 different bowls of ingredients (one for tomatos, one for corn and one for cucumber). When swiping up from one of the bowls, for example the one with cucumber, a cucumber flies into the air and you then have to hit it with your knifes you can shoot with your left hand. (Explained earlier) When you hit it it turns into pieces and adds to your dish and you get points. So it's pretty similar to Fruit Ninja. \n\nYour goals is to cut all ingredients under the time limit and if you miss a ingredient and it falls to the ground you have to wait out a cool down until you get more cucumbers. And the faster and effective you get the food done the more points you earn.\n\nCan you please provide me with feedback to this mechanic in a mobile game. Every thought is good."
o91013,Battlefield by way of Doom,"Allow me to clarify: this game would be a 20 v 20 arena style shooter in which two teams use powerful weapons to fight their away to the enemy base and capture it.

If one team can capture all three zones, they win."

o8saev,"""Collaborative exploring simulator""?","Pretty much a 'community-based' game, where the developer would form a solar system, physics, or whatever they want to make for the player to explore, and you would play as someone who knows nothing about the world you are in whatsoever. \n\nYour goal, as someone who knows pretty much nothing about the place you are in, is to do experiments, measurements, maybe figure out the circumference of the planet you are in. Or maybe you would look at the nightsky and wonder about the retrograde motion of a dot in the sky? Maybe there could be a moon orbiting this planet, and you would want to figure out how far it is?\n\nAnyways, for all that, only one person would not find it that fun, here comes what (for me, personally) would be fun:\n\nYou could participate in discussions — maybe in a online chat inside the game, formed with small groups of people helping each other on exploring? Or maybe there could be a separate forum made for the game, where people could post hypothesis, conjectures, theories, ideas, and whatnot."
o8s2n8,"A ""complex"" rocket building survival game","Okay so, first, in my idea, the planets are really small (unrealistically, even), like Outer Wilds or something like that. But, anyways, the main idea is:\n\nYou are an astronaut who somehow got stuck on another planet, and you lost your ship.\n\nYou then survive and evolve, to a point where you have enough resources to start molding ship pieces, for example. And here is the key, you don't just craft them, you have the control of changing the shape of it, and fitting it all together. E.g: you can form pipes, chambers, etc.\n\nYou would then have ficticious liquids and gases you could form using chemestry tools you built, which you could use to propel your rocket, somehow, for example. \n\nAnd even a bonus (that might be too complex): a feature where you can build capsules, create small storages for parachutes, or something like that. With that, you could place wires, valves, or any piece of structure needed.\n\nAll planets would be inside an N-Body Simulation, and you could figure out how to do things on your own. For example: if you want to get to a planet, you could try observing where it is in the sky, to maybe do some quick math to accelerate in that direction... well, you got my point, right?\n\nSome more fun: if you're in orbit (or even a sub-orbital trajectory) you would maybe be able to unbuckle off your seatbelt and explore around your capsule, while you float.\n\nI don't know, random ideas here."

o8mvtl,Idea for a game about surviving a nuclear apocalypse,"I’m not going to make this because I know nothing about programming but I just thought it would be cool, you could start the game with a cutscene, your character is on a subway listening to the news on your phone or watch describing a escalating war between 2 countries(you can choose) when all of a sudden you see a bright light and hear a loud book with a wave of debris making its way to you, at this point the game slows down a bit and you have to press something to grab onto a bar and hopefully survive the fall(you are high up) as you grab on the train starts to tilts and falls, there’s a loud bang of the train hitting the ground and the screen goes black, you then wake up unable to do anything but crawl with your vision blurry and the screams of everyone in the city slowly fading to silence and have to try to make it to safety, I know its just a start but what do you guys think?"

o8ieys,I am creating a top down shooter and I have a wonder.,
o8efux,Gameplay based around hand signaling,"I was thinking of an online coop game with hand signaling mechanics as a way to communicate. It’s something that I think would be pretty cool to play in VR especially, but might also work without it. Could be used in a stealth game, where you have to make hand signals to your partner to tell them what to do, where to go or what areas to avoid, for example. Then, for trickier situations, you might have to come up with new gestures in the moment or before starting the game.\n\nA game like this wouldn’t neccessarily need voice chat, but if there was it could be something that has to be used sparingly. I can think of a few scenarios in which this could work: you and your friend are stuck behind enemy lines with soldiers crawling everywhere. You need to get back to your superiors to deliver an important message, but you also have needs to address (perhaps wounds need tending, supplies are low, food is scarce, etc.) I don’t know much about the military though, so this might be all wrong haha.\n\nAnother possible scenario: You are being hunted by a large monster with very good hearing and must use hand signals, traps, makeshift weapons and clever tactics to escape or defeat it.\n\nThat, or another idea I just had, you’re playing a first-person story-driven farming sim, and part of your duties include working late at night in the fields, or on the buildings of your property. This is where the hand signaling could come in: you found out there’s a hole in the roof over a bedroom where your family is sleeping, and it’s about to rain. You and your relative/farmhand/partner must quickly patch the hole before the rain comes while making little to no sounds to avoid waking the others.\n\nMaybe not great examples, but I’m just brainstorming here. Thoughts?"

You want their scare meter to fill, but not ""break"". Guest's scare meter goes down when they're not being scare.\n\nGameplay involves building the structure of the haunted house to maximize the space you have, placing decorations, hiring and costuming scarers, picking scary special effects, etc. New items and scares are unlocked as you continue.\n\nSome guests are more difficult to scare than others. You can think of this kind of like a tower defense game where you ""defend"" the exit of the haunted house by scaring guests."

o8766q,The game idea I've had stuck in my head for about ten years:,"I need to get this out of my head. Even if somebody made this game and didn't give me any credit I would be happy. So here it is;\n\nA zombie game, set in modern time. Sounds boring and over done? Let me explain. [P.S I have absolutely ZERO idea how creating games work, for the record.]\n\nAn open world single player RPG, a mix between games like Skyrim and The Forest. The game starts and you wake up and step out of bed in your penthouse apartment in New York or L.A. in first person you walk into the bathroom and look in the mirror, this is where you create your character. Everything from haircuts, eyes to even custom genitalia.\n\nAfter creating and naming your character, you turn and a dog sits behind you and barks. You then create your dog, which is your follower / companion. You turn on the news and see that over night, a zombie apocalypse has broken out. In panic you stand and look out of your glass windows, down at the street and spot thousands of zombies. Before a helicopter crashes into your building.\n\nYou wake up, only god knows how long after the crash, in rubble, awoken by your dog licking your face. The sun is setting.. and boom. After this, you are free to do whatever you want.\n\nYou can meet people on the road and choose to do many things. Recruit them in your group, kill them, rob them, even eat them. Some characters will be friendly and become great members of your group. Others will lie, gain your trust and try to rob or kill you. Make your decisions wisely.\n\nSet up a camp anywhere, with a ""settlement mode"" type mode, like in Fallout 4 but massively improved. Assign the members of your group to different jobs.\n\nOr.. completely go at it alone. Face the world with just you and your pet dog. You must eat, sleep and drink. Stay warm, but not too warm if the weather is hot. Gain sicknesses. Perhaps you meet somebody who use to be a doctor.. but can you trust them?\n\nMeet other groups (NPCs, not online.) And either work with them, agaisnt them or just stay away from each other. They won't bother you if you don't bother them.. some groups, however, *will* attack you, hoping to gain your recourses.\n\nChoose your background and skills. Perhaps you're good with cars because you was a mechanic? Maybe you can cure your own sicknesses as you was a doctor or nurse? Maybe you was a dumb 22 year old dreaming about how awesome a game like this would be. It's all up to you.\n\nI could go into more detail. Weapons, cars, quests. I will, if anybody would like. As I said I've thought about this game for around a decade and no, I still can't think of a good name for it. I think ""my game"" would work well set in a Walking Dead universe, but it doesn't *need* to be set in TWD universe.\n\nI could also go into massive detail about custom settings. ""No eating requirements"" for example. Just so everybody can truly play the game however they want to play it.\n\nI'm happy to anwser any questions.\n\nIn short, imagine a Bethesda (Skyrim/Fallout) open world RPG, with Telltale choices and consequences, with survival mechanics like The Forest or The Long Dark. Anyways that's a brief summary of my idea. Thanks for reading :)"
o873zv,Sim Copter-like but you can import any other game's levels as levels to play on.,"Basically the game figures out the geometry of the game when you import a level (from simcity 4/3000/2000, city skylines, or whatever city builder) and replace the imported assets with higher detail assets with its own art style and make it more detailed. It places key buildings in game where it is located in the imported map. \n\nThe importer figures out the navmeshes for pedestrians and vehicles based on the replaced assets. \n\nThen finally, you can play and do missions in your imported map. \n\nMake it crossplay across other gaming systems and make map borders connected to other verified maps for a seamless integration.\n\nVoila, Sim Copter-like World if you want to call it like that.\n\nMake the game free to play, charge for asset pack replacements, skins, etc."
o86z82,Had dream abour vampire v human third person game,"Last night i had a dream about third person game multiplayer game, where you are given to pick sides between human and vampire.\nThe game had a bar at the bottom of the screen in the middle a bar that was an indicator for what is coming, be it day or night. The bar was filling slowly if for example it is night, bar is filling and it says day. So when the day is full imidiately everythins switches.\nIf it is nighttime the vampires hunts human and have special powers, such as ability to jump high and can decend slow, and also dash.\nBut if it is daytime vampire cannot be outside and has an option to roam trough interiors, which are pretty big. There are big hallways and many doors\nAnd now the humans basically hunts the vamps, have better chance of beating them during the day, since vampire doesn't have special abilities, and the wooden stake is given to humans\nStill vampire still is slightly faster, but many rooms and big hallways make the things a bit interesting. Anyway the game may not be well balanced but it is just a dream and an interesting idea that can be polished.\nAlso there were skins to pick\nVampire in a dream was a guy with big hat and cape, and human i think had a brown leather with a bit long hair."

o821oc,UnderSOULs: Undertale with Dark Souls gameplay (minor Undertale spoilers ahead),"Undertale is my favorite game, and Dark Souls 3 is my 2nd favorite. I have an idea of learning game development so I can recreate the entirety of Undertale, except it has the gameplay of Dark Souls. I really loved fighting Sans because of his hard but mostly fair difficulty, which reminded me of the difficulty of Dark Souls. I imagined this type of difficulty with Omega Flowey, Asgore, etc. The only difficulty I can think of making this is implementing an ACT and MERCY mechanic into Dark Souls gameplay. I want to learn to make music so I can possibly make metal covers of a majority of the ost, specifically the songs that play when fighting. However, this is all just a dream that I can't make true until possibly a few years from now. I am only 14, and the closest I can get to a computer is a crappy school Chromebook with a filter that restricts lots of things.\n\nPS: dang I just read the rules and saw rule 2 so I sure hope this idea doesn't break that rule because there's already multiple Undertale fan games that literally copy the fight mechanic of Undertale, so I said ""yo what if I do that except I don't copy the gameplay."" I intend to recreate Undertale with Dark Souls gameplay, and I don't expect to make money by literally stealing ideas"

o818sf,A game similar to GTA but everyone is potatos,"You play as a potato moving to Spud City and you can do whatever you want, but assuming you follow the map to your apartment you'll get involved with a gang somehow non-willingly and need to do what they say, your first mission being to kidnap the mayor's daughter for ransom. From this point on your choices have an impact on everything. Just walk or drive out of the city and the game ends and you get the boring ending. Kidnap her and do all the other missions while still being reluctant during playable cutscenes similar to telltale or be all for it and move up the ranks. Join the police after escaping the mafia to get revenge. It's really all up to you. I imagine there would also be a free play mode with no story really."

o7ut8y,A game where the community decide wich event they want to happen with the preasure that they won't get the other.,"Basically my game will be very basic, guns, some powers and shit, but the best part is that the community will give to chose a event that they want to happen but the other will not happen, every event will have a lore and every event that is chosed will be cannon, i find this funny because there probably will occur a lot of fights in the community and there will be a lot of trolls and more shit.\n\nNow if this idea of a game got a secuel it would be the same, basically i will publish a secuel and some time later probably some months i will drop the bomb, that the secuel is not cannon and i will reveal that there will be two options, one the ""true ending"" or ""the secuel becomes cannon"", but this time it will not be by votes, it will be a tournament(sorry if i writed that incorrectly english is not my first lenguaje) it will be balanced on skill, at the end the results will choose 2 teams of people, every team supports a different ending, the final battle will choose the future."
o7svsd,A game where you make and play as a monster and you scare people,"In this game you create a monster (in a way similar to Spore) and the main idea is to scare humans while keeping in secret, sort of like the show Aaahh!! real monsters. The game would have you go on assignments to scare certain people to earn points which can be traded in so your character can learning new scaring techniques in order to level up. The game would rely on stealth and hiding from bystanders in order to reach the victim and complete the assignment to earn points, you can also evolve your characters appearance like adding extra limbs or accessories. This is not something I’m working on myself but I hope someone will see this post and get an idea."

Although no one knows it, you are immortal due to a curse hundreds of years ago.\n\nThe only way to win the game is to replay it at enough *different points in time* where there are different people in your life, and you must get to know them in order to figure out how to break the curse.

Things you do in your future runs would affect your past runs, and things in your past runs would affect your future runs.\n\nThere would also be a bunch of custom characters that can meet the character, fall in love, become best friends, (personality system / 1-on-1 relations) etc. You would have to witness all these people die since you are immortal. Additionally, history could be discovered about them later which was never known before. You could also do things in the past to affect the future, to say, make sure your friend survives, but this would only be possible before you knew your friend died. As you play through time, it solidifies in placee and is stuck like this forever; the time between these solidified events are malleable but also change in order to fit the current narrative on either sides of the story.\n\nThe game would be mostly interaction-based with you walking around a 2D scene and approaching people. There would be some depth to the 2D scene making it look paperlike."

o2w5fm,Hello Can You guys suggest some cool mechanics for my 2d platformer game,
o2vyig,Arbitrary Frenzy: A 5v5 FPS Multiplier Game,"A 5v5 FPS Multiplier game, however, your weapons, equipments, etc. are all random.   \n\n\n(Also, I'm not sure about the name so let me know if you have a better idea :/)  \n\n\nThe objective of the game is to destroy the opponent's ""core"". Each team will have a base, the core being in the middle or something. Teams spawn in and prepare in the ""Ready-Up Phase"" (\~2 minutes). In the ""Ready-Up Phase"", players will select their **Primary Weapon**, **Secondary Weapon**, **Equipment**, **Transportation/Vehicle**, and **Ability**. During this phase, players will also start off with a few coins (\~1,000). (More on Coins later)  \n\n\n**Primary Weapons** are main weapons such as a rifle, sniper, laser, rocket launcher, etc.  \n**Secondary Weapons** are weapons like pistols, alien blasters, etc.  \n**Equipments** are items such as grenades, Molotov cocktails, freeze bomb, etc.  \n**Transportation/Vehicles** are things like cars, helicopters, jets, etc.  \n**Ability** is a special power that players can use to help them.  \n\n\nThe game will randomly choose 3 of each category and players can select 1 of the 3. Players will have a certain amount of time to select each category (\~20 seconds). If players do not choose, the game will randomly select one.  \n\n\n(I'm not sure if players should have to select new weapons, etc. when they die or when it's a new game though)  \n\n\nOnce this phase is over, the game will start. Players will then have to destroy the other's core. Each teams base will be protected with turrets, cannons, etc. As long as the core is not destroyed, players can respawn. I'm not sure about this, but maybe, once a teams' core is destroyed, players on that team will still be alive, but if they die, they die permanently (similar to Bedwars in Minecraft).   \n\n\nNow, how coins will work. Coins can be obtained by killing players and destroying the opponents' base (turrets, cannons, etc.). The main (and maybe only) purpose of coins is to upgrade your teams' base (turrets, cannons, etc.) and your passive ability/stats. They can also be used to rebuild your turrets, cannons, etc. (if they're destroyed by the opponents).   \n\n\n**Passive abilties/stats** are stuff like damage multiplier, coin multiplier, speed multiplier, etc.  \n\n\nAnd, I think that's about it (gameplay wise)."
o2vu7d,Anti-peta beat em up,"The plot goes like this: the hero was out walking their dog, when a PeTA representative runs by and snatches the puppy from your hands. You chase them to a ""shelter"", where you find that they've already put it down (which is a true story, they regularly kidnap and murder people's pets). With a shotgun. So then the rest of the game has you beat up peta members, the animal rights militia (terrorists who kill people in the name of animal rights), and celebrities who have endorsed peta on your way to norfolk, virginia, where you plan on taking the fight to cyborg ingrid newkirk (the final boss) and avenge your dog. There would be a mechanic where you save other kidnapped pets by destroying their cages, and the food pickups, ironically, are all vegan, proving you don't have to be a total shitbag to be vegan."
o2v7eb,Three way animosity system,"This is a mechanic for world building in a multi racial/faction environment. For explanation purposes I will use humans, elves, and orcs, but this mechanic could expand to any alien race or political factions making up a game world.\n\nThe mechanic is each race will love members of its own race, tolerate  one  other race, and despise the third race. For example humans tolerate elves and despise orcs, elves tolerate orcs and despise humans, and orcs tolerate humans and despise elves.\n\nThe player can build a crew that consists of one race and it will have high morale, but if they bring in members of another race to take advantages of the race specific game mechanics, one of the two groups of the crew will start loosing morale unless the player spends resources to bring the morale up. For example a mostly human crew brings on a few elves for their bow making skill. The humans are happy but the elves are miserable to be forced to live among so many humans. The player can buy an elfin meditation garden to keep his bow makers happy.\n\nThis expands to how your crew interacts with NPC groups. The mixed elf human crew get preferential treatment at Human settlements who don't see hated orcs. Elf settlements dislike the crew since it is majority human but are not as hostile due to the slight elf presence. Orc settlements are neutral to the player's crew since it is majority human but hey would be friendlier if there were not the slight elf presence."

o2odu6,A 1st person shooter where you try to kill as few aliens on the Moon as possible.,"Feel free to use this idea.\n\nStory: On one of the Apollo missions, a tool left on the Lunar surface had Staph viruses from Earth on it. Not only did some viruses survive, but a few went into the Lunar surface and adapted to a waterless and airless environment.  This seeded life on the Moon, which underwent a very rapid evolution.  When NASA returned to the Moon in 2024, they found intelligent beings that greeted them. The Lunarians were civil with the astronauts, and the first mission went well. In 2030, you were chosen for the next mission. When you landed, there was a thrust malfunction that killed a few Lunarians waiting to greet you.  This tragic misunderstanding led them to believe that you were hostile and there to kill them. You must now repair your ship and leave, while killing as few Lunarians in self defense as possible.  The more you kill, the more damage it will do to interspecies relations.\n\nMission: To repair your ship, you need to retrieve 3 items on the Lunar surface. The first is a set of wires from a probe that landed years ago. The second is a battery in a supply crate. The third is a repair kit left over from the previous mission.  You begin the game with a detailed map.  The 3 items have a different placement on the map for each game, and will be spaced far apart.\n\nStats:  You have 6 hours of oxygen in your suit, and the game is designed to last about 2 hours playing at standard speed. Oxygen isn’t much of a problem unless you play very slowly and strategically. You also have a gun that fires high velocity particles (given to you by NASA as a precaution). The gun has 10,000 charges, so you have more than enough ammo unless you shoot recklessly.  Your suit can take 100 hits. After that, it ruptures and you decompress and die.\n\nObjective and scoring:  Your score is determined by how many Lunarians you **don’t** kill.  You must retrieve the 3 pieces needed to repair your ship, do the repairs, and then come home. The game world is a large piece of the Lunar surface, and there are 500 Lunarians in total. A perfect score would be 500, and that’s if you beat the game without killing a single one (which would be practically impossible).  A score of 0 is if you kill them all (or if you die from decompression or suffocation).\n\nGraphics and audio:  The graphics should look as close to the real Moon’s surface as possible, and should have hills, valleys, craters, cliffs, etc. The sky should have stars, the Sun, and the Earth. Your view is 1st person from inside of your environment suit.  There is no music in the game, and the only sounds that you hear are your own breathing, your footsteps, the click of your gun when you fire, the impact of being hit, the occasional radio transmission, and your own scream if you die.  Space is a vacuum, so you hear nothing outside of your suit.  All movement should reflect Lunar gravity.\n\nLunarians: They are short and stocky, with thick carapaces. Lunarians have 10 legs, and stand partially upright on their bottom 4 legs. They have 3 eyes, 2 antennas on top of their heads, and protruding circular mouths with teeth all around. Their color is light grey, like the Lunar surface. Their technology is primitive, and they attack by throwing rocks, throwing spears, or with their claws. In some parts of the game, you see odd-looking structures made of stones, which are their above-ground buildings.  It takes 1 to 4 shots to kill a Lunarian.\n\nOther:  You can save your game and come back to it later,  The view is 1st person, and movement is 3-D. You can select your gender, but the only difference is the sound of the scream if you die (which would be either a masculine or feminine scream).  You should be able to log on to the server to upload your score, and view the top scores. There should also be deathmatch tournaments where two players battle it out with each other.\n\nFun fact: If this game is made, then it will be the very first 1st person shooter where the objective is to kill as few opponents as possible!"
o2cva2,A sci-fi game theme that can allow permanent and permadeath characters to compete against each other in PvP.,"Hi, just posting a game idea :) The idea is for a storyline that meshes with a type of gameplay.\n\nThe gameplay part is a way to have procedural level generation, permanent characters on one side and permadeath/hardcore characters on another side.\n\nThe storyline is a sci-fi thing, there is an entity called the ""Locust Fleet"" which goes from system to system, or maybe star cluster to star cluster, consuming the resources of that cluster.  These represent the permanent characters, who are the villains.\n\nThe heroes are the permadeath/hardcore characters.  They represent the system defenders.  If they die, they are typically permanently dead, depending on some other possible stuff such as wounding systems.\n\nThe terrain of key areas on each planet in each system is procedurally generated.  The heroes (system defenders) win if they can cause enough damage to the attacking Locust Fleet, or delay them for long enough.  The Locust Fleet has to move on after suffering enough damage/delay because there is an even more dangerous entity that is hunting them, so they can't stay in one place for too long.  There are also plenty of systems/clusters that have little to no defense, so if a system is defended too well, it's simply not worth it to them to stay in that system.  They also typically never return to a system that they have previously attacked because it is either stripped of most/all useful resources already, or if it wasn't, they can assume that attacking without the element of surprise is not a good idea since they already failed when they attacked with it.\n\nThe Locust Fleet wins if they can take enough of the system/cluster resources, which typically involves killing most/all of the system defenders.\n\nIn rare cases, a successful system defender might follow the Locust Fleet and help defend a new system, which means both role-play opportunities and a chance to increase the ""high score"" of a specific hero character.  But having a hero character die reduces the points value, which discourages having every single defender follow to a new zone every time.\n\nSo, the game idea is basically a sci-fi themed battle game with procedural stages but the interesting part is a way to combine permadeath with permanent characters in a PvP setting."

o21jcj,Beach Life remake/remaster!!!,"Hi Guys,\n\nI am not the biggest fan of management games (although I have 1160 hours on Surviving Mars) but IMHO Beach Life is a very good and rare management game from 2002. It's a beach resort game and this is why I dare to call it rare. I've played a ton of different games but no other game made me install Windows XP (or some emulation of it) so many times on my newer PCs over the years just to be able to play it since it's 19 years old game after all.\n\nIt seems very simple on prima vista but actually there are a lot of unique gameplay mechanics involved.\n\nIt has some nice randomizations as every single tourist has his own preferences and opinions about stuff. Every scenario seems to have some hidden modifications i.e. sometimes tourists will demand (more than usual) more bars, or water attractions, or places to party or cleanness etc.\n\nIt's fun to intentionally sell a strong beer in order to cause more crime and then have the security guard apprehend the drunk and violent person and get you some nice cashback.\n\nOr let sharks solve any potential overcrowding issues :) )).\n\nAnd this game still almost two decades later doesn't have a COMPETITOR!!! Literally I cannot find a single similar game allowing you to manage a beach resort. There might be some hybrid games where you manage a lot of stuff including beach related attractions but I've never seen a game just like Beach Life focusing entirely on one topic. \n\nThe reason I suggest this is because I am sure that there is a reasonable amount of money to be made by creating a remake/remaster of Beach Life as the market simply lacks such product.  And I would also enjoy playing such a game."

o1w6j9,A game where you get to make your own ability," This game idea is inspired by hunterxhunter, I created a post on this subreddit about this idea 10 months ago and I am reposting the idea because I have fleshed out the idea more now. I have used the flair dream but I think it could be made in smaller versions, the reason I took the dream flair is because my vision of it is really big and the version, I want to see be created is really large. The idea is a game where you get to create your own ability and I will post different version of this idea in this post because I couldn’t decide on one. In the paragraph after this one I'll talk about how Nen works and then after that I’ll talk about how the game would work.  \n\nYou can skip to the next paragraph if you want to just hear about the game idea itself. First, I need to explain a little about how hunterxhunters (hxh) magic/power system works, it's called Nen and you can use Nen to make your own ability. Nen has 6 different classes they are transmuter, enhancer, specialist, conjurer, manipulator and emission. The enhancer class lets you increase the strength of objects or yourself for example, you can strengthen your fist to make it do more damage when you punch and transmuter lets you use Nen to mimic the properties of something, for example you can mimic the properties of rubber and gum to make something that has the properties of both rubber and gum. I won't go into what all the classes do just google hxh Nen if you want to know more. The class you are assigned makes it so that you can use the classes full potential for example if two Nen users of equal skill were to enhance their fist to punch something and if one was a transmuter and the other one an enhancer the enhancer would do more damage than the transmuter. However, there is a class called the specialist class that the other classes can't use the potential of, a specialist has a unique ability only they can use like steal other abilities or predict the future etc. but a specialist can still do what the other classes can do. You can also put restrictions/conditions on an ability to make it stronger so, maybe, certain conditions need to be met before you can use an ability or you have restrictions on an ability for example you can only use an ability for a short period of time before the ability runs out and you have to wait to use it again. That’s all I'm going to explain about the Nen system I will say I did cut a lot out for simplicity's sake. \n\nSo, the idea I have for a game is where you can create your own ability. There are games that let you create other games and worlds like dreams on the PS4 and lots of games with customizable characters, but I have yet to see anything for abilities. So, the way it would maybe work is you have an in-game editor that is specifically designed to make abilities, I don’t have the technical skills to even make a prototype for this yet so I'm just going to put forward theories. Basically, you would choose a power like fire, ice or wind and then you get to choose how to manipulate that power for example you can choose projectile or sword etc. So, you are probably wondering how would you balance out the abilities and I'll go more in depth about that later but the more things you put on the ability the higher the cooldown. \n\nNow I'll start presenting the different version of the game \n\n3d 1v1 pvp/ 1v1 pve version – For this version you would be in a colosseum where you fight other players or A.I. the arenas would have different themes maybe one is covered in ice/water and another arena is covered in fire/magma. The reason why I'm bringing up the themes of the arenas is because I would like for the environments the players are in to be useful so you can manipulate it and do very creative things with the players ability. Now I’ll go in depth with how the ability customization would work (this is just an example there a many different ways to make the ability system). First, you’d have a power like lightning, fire, ice, smoke, wind etc. You can then pick how you want the power to be manipulated and for the different powers there would be different ways to manipulate the power, they would be sorted into the different states of matter, the reason for having the abilities be sorted into different states of matter is because I wanted It to be somewhat realistic for example in real life you can't make a damage dealing sword out of smoke, another reason is the powers will have pre-determined attributes implemented so lightning travels really quickly by default and does a lot of damage, while smoke only makes it harder to see if the smoke is there, so if you were to make a sword out of smoke it wouldn’t do any damage by default. For this versions purposes it will be stamina, health, mana, cooldown seconds, that will be used to put limitations on the ability. So, you select the power wind which by default costs 1sec to use, you could instead make it cost 50 mana out of a mana pool of 1000 mana or make the wind power costs 50 health points out of a health pool of 1000. and then you select how you want the wind power to be manipulated, you get the options push the wind, pull the wind, tornado (basically any form that wind can take on Irl). So, you select tornado, a tornados attributes are that if it hits an enemy, the enemy will get stuck at the top of the tornado for as long as the tornado lasts, the tornado will last 1 sec by default and the tornado costs 3 seconds by default. Now you may have noticed we have only made a tornado but it wouldn’t move or has anything else on it, so, you can then pick if you want to shoot the tornado in the way you are aiming which would costs 1 sec more on the cooldown. You can pick if you want a new power to mix with the tornado let's say lighting, so now you have a lightning tornado that will move forward for 1 sec when you use it. So, you’d also be able to adjust the size of the tornado, it would have a default size which I think would be around the size of the character you are playing the bigger you make the higher the cool down. I would like to add that for simplicity's sake the bigger the ability becomes, the stronger it is, what I mean by the bigger it is the stronger it is, is, if you make the tornado bigger it will have a bigger radius for pulling things into the tornado itself. You could also adjust the time that the ability is out, for example each second you add to the length of the time that the ability is out the cooldown increases by 0.5 sec. Maybe you’d want the tornado to stay in place after the tornado has moved forward for a certain amount of time so you would also be able to edit that. I think I have made my point clear in terms of how the ability menu would work (in theory at least). So, what about a progression system, I have thought of two ways for a progression system, one is the higher level you get, the more mana, stamina and health you get, the cool downs would still be the same. The other option is the higher you level up, the lower the cool downs default cost is. I am also considering being able to use the environment to your advantage, but I can't think of a fun way gameplay wise where that would work, for example maybe you can pick golem in the ability menu editor and the only way to spawn a golem is if you have enough let’s say magma around you to create a golem, so, now you have a golem made out of magma, so the environment around could be used to create things but the restriction is that it would need a certain quantity of for example magma in the area to create the golem. Every time you enter a battle you wouldn’t be able to change the ability so, if you go up against a boss, you can't change the ability while on that boss, so even If you die you have to have the same ability until you beat the boss. So, I think that’s going to be it for this version on to the next one. \n\nPuzzel game version \- Basically for this version you would have to make abilities to beat the levels in the game. I’ll be honest I haven't given a lot of thought about how a game like this would work, but you would start with a power and then as you progress through the levels you get new powers after beating the previous level. The higher the level the more combinations and the more advanced the puzzle becomes. I put in this version of the game just to show how diverse this idea can be.    \n\n3d OpenWorld rpg version \- So, this version does take a lot of inspiration from Minecraft. You would start with nothing only a health, mana, and stamina bar. But the world itself would have a bit of a twist as the starting area would not be randomly generated so you would start on a huge island with a few kingdoms constantly at war which you can ally with, there is a lot more to this idea that I have thought out but I won't be mentioning it here because it would be too long of a post, but I'd be willing to explain this idea out in more detail if asked, I also, want to focus more on the game idea itself which is making your own ability. So, you start off with nothing and I'm not sure if I want the player to start of knowing how to use the mana system (I don’t think I have mentioned it but the mana system is what I have named the create your own ability system) or if the player does know the mana system but you don’t have access to a wide variety of powers or no power at all just only the mana system. For this version I need to explain some of the story I have written for the mana system, in short mana is life force, which means that mana can only be wielded by living beings, mana itself looks like some type of invisible energy, mana can only be used to mimic other forms of matter/energy in the universe, so you could copy fire, light etc. So, each kingdom would have powers that they specialize in, maybe there is a kingdom that specializes in lightning or another kingdom that specialize in wind etc. I know this is just straight up taken for avatar the last airbender but I'm not very original 😛. So, you as the player would gain different powers from each kingdom once you travel to them and learn from the people how to utilize each power. I was thinking about doing multiple endings for the 3d OpenWorld for example maybe you could restore peace to the kingdoms or make everyone your slave etc. But I won’t go into it more than what I already have done. Everything expect for the kingdoms would be fully destructible. Like I said in the beginning of the post I could go into it more but it would be too long of a post.  \n\n2d Platformer\- So, this is another idea I haven't given a lot of thought into, but I'm going to mention it because this is the easiest version to make, because you don’t have to think in 3 dimensions. The animations would be in pixel art so they would be easier to make then a 3d version. That is all I have to say about this version, but basically take the 3d 1v1 pvp/ 1v1 pve version I wrote and just make that idea into 2d.  \n\nHunterxHunter version \- So, I think I have always wanted a hxh game ever since I first watched it in 2015 but I just didn’t have an interest in gamedev at the time. I haven't given this idea much thought because it would be really difficult to make unless you want to take some artistic liberties, so, for example the gameplay needs to feel good and I’m not sure how that would happen when abilities like Hisoka's bungee gum exist. I'm not going to go into it too much but I’m just not sure how to make a fun game using Nen unless you cut out a lot from the Nen system. I had a few ideas like maybe for the specialist class if you were to pick it then you would get a random unique ability that you couldn’t choose, which is why it would be a high risk selecting that class, I have more ideas I think but that’s all I feel like sharing.      \n\nFinal words \- personally I feel like the multiplayer game industry has gotten very stale, not sure if it always has been this way. To me games have started to feel very similar especially multiplayer games, or it's just the same problems I have with other games that reoccur in others. Personally, I want a game where creativity in combat is the larger focus and not a game where just being good at one thing like aiming makes it so you win and I hope that a game like this would be refreshing for the game industry. Finally, I have basically realized that my real-life problems make it so that I won’t really ever be able to make this game in the vision I want, I keep watching tutorials, then I stop and forget everything in an endless cycle so I don’t think I’ll ever be able to make this game sadly, but I keep dreaming about it. "
o1vg3e,Speed Racer,"Ok here me out, I just rewatched the movie Speed Racer after a very long time and I think it's an amazing movie, now I know it received a lot of bad rep and is considered a failure to some but even the idea is incredible.\n\nI had the idea of turning it into a game. Now I know there have been games but those a really old and honestly not what I'm aiming for. I'm looking at most of the movie elements, there's colossal tracks, secret(illegal too)weapons to modify vehicles and so much can go into customization of an iconic race car. I want to add these ALL OF IT. I imagine it could be a multiplayer and a really large game in terms of storage because of all the things I want incorporated. I thought it could have a tutorial on how to maneuver the car because I do want to see the exact thing we see in the movie or something close enough even just the feel.\n\nI could honestly ramble about this all day so for now I'll leave it hear. And I realized that most of this is all about the movie so it may not gain much popularity. It's just a thought anyway."
o1p0tf,Trapped in a game so glitchy the npcs become sentient,"The story would involve the hero being trapped inside a shitty game, like in avgn adventures, but the game was progra.med SO badly, that the game characters become sentient, and so some of them, like the friendly npcs, ask to join your party so they can escape the game with you, while the villians want to invade the real world, which they do in the final level. The gameplay itself involves abusing the glitches to your advantage, such as a noclip teleport, or messing up the graphics as a distraction. The ending will have the heroes realize they're still stuck in a game (the one being played), and then they bust out of the game window (or into the console menu), complete with a cartoony hole where they lept out of, and run off into the internet (or the digital store), and then if you have that save data, they show up in other games, living new lives travelling the multiverse."
o1m7oo,Lawyer from space,"You are a successful attorney at law, until one day you get abducted by aliens.\n\nTurns out their alien society has a legal system with their own prosecutors and lawyers, but all their lawyers are terrible, and form a society to try and find their way. That is when they find Earth, another planet with intelligent life and its own legal system, and quickly find you (yes, the lawyer from space is YOU!). They decide to abduct you to spearhead a new age of lawyers.\n\nAt first glance, it may sound like a space-themed Ace Attorney, but as a visitor to a whole different planet, you have to unravel a completely different society, with different cultures, customs, and of course, law. Inbetween your lawyering, you must understand how the wheels of their civilization works in order to reach that not guilty veredict. Can you get used to what is now considered legal or crime? Can you win in a battle of wits where common sense is thrown out of the window? How will you act when you have to choose between your dearly held morals and their law?\n\nIDK, sounds like a fun game to me."

o1gwza,A co-op platformer but with a unique POV,"Basically your POV is of the character your partner controls and vice versa. except you control the camera. So you would need to describe how far to move and which ways and where jumps need to be done.\n\nThe game could start with your partner visible, so you are able to see what you are doing from a perspective (like a fixed camera-ish) and then slowly block vision of your partner/ character you control to solely rely on your partner to describe what to do."
o1ffff,"Game that's all Controls Tutorials, but it gets Weird","My game idea is one where the entire thing is a controls tutorial puzzle game.\n\nSo, the game will start by starting with WASD and Space Bar to complete a certain task.\n\nThen then it becomes DSAW and Space for the same task, or a different one it doesn't really matter. \n\nEventually, after some escalation, the tutorials become more like riddles or visual puzzles to figure out the controls.\n\nI'm also picturing a level where the mechanism that tells you the controls breaks for a level, so it's a matter of randomly clicking keyboard buttons till you find the keys. Or another level where the player actions change the controls mid level. Or maybe a level that's red light green light, but the player has to adapt to changing controls.\n\nNot sure how to end it, maybe a typing of the dead style boss fight using weird controls, I don't know. That's my idea, thank you!"
o1f80j,Multiplayer hitman,"I know 2 player hitman ghost mode exist. The idea I suggest is 5 players in the same world getting target for 8 rounds(8 targets). You have to blend in with npc and find out other players. In addition to getting outfit from npc, there will be shops that sell clothing in-game and you can steal clothes w/o alerting the merchants. \nIt only make sense to start the players at different location équidistance from the first target. \nVisuals: can be 2D or topdown. Doesn’t need to be 3D, third person or FPP.\nAesthetics: cartoonish or realistic. Simplistic, futuristic, noir or abstract. Depends on you.   \nGameplay: similar to Hitman but feel free to add combat style to make it more John Wicky.\nIf topdown or 2D try to add limited field of view as seeing the whole map ruins the concept.\nEnd-game: can go with points like in hitman. Gain points: when target eliminated, no suspicion. Lose point: when you die, got exposed. Can buy cosmetics and equipments from points received.\nGame balanced: I mentioned buying equipments but this could be unfair for new players. So after purchasing equipments, they can be found in boxes that can be open by all players. But the player who purchased it knows the location of it.\nThanks for the read. Feel free to add more ideas or use it."

o1bi1q,A mertroidvania puzzle platformer on ice,"**Story:** you play as a character named swift, and swift's family all got sick with a rare and deadly disease. Swift was told by the town's priest that a cure can be made from a magical flower, this flower can only be found deep in a dungeon built into a large cave. The priest tried to warn swift of the dangers the dungeon held, but swift was determined and began gathering a few supplies. Before leaving, the priest gave swift a pair of enchanted boots that turned the ground he stepped on to ice. So with nothing but a few weapons and the ice boots, swift set out to claim this magical flower, but things aren't as they seem.\n\n**Gameplay:** a 2d pixel platformer with very little friction. You slide around a massive dungeon, discovering secrets, and defeating enemies. you can choose to wield 4 different weapons, and each have their own skill trees and attack patterns. The weapons are a sword, a battle axe, a bow, and a magic wand. Each weapon has a heavy attack and a light attack that will activate different moves depending on where and how your moving, similar to combat from brawlhala. There will be 4 main areas/levels to explore and find secrets in, these areas are the barracks, the dark dungeons, the enchanted tower, and the frozen garden. \n\nEach area has its own boss, and once you kill them you get their weapon which gives you a new ability. There will also be secret mini bosses that will upgrade your ice boots in different ways. You can slide, double jump, dash, and leap off walls. I also plan to add a PvP arena where you can battle other players.\n\nWhat are some things you would like to see in the game, or anything you would like to change?"
o19s51,Choice based game,"Its a 1v1 competitive game where both side choose between soldiers and then the fight happens automatically.\n\n\nEach player start with 100$ and secretly choose 1  soldier between 25 different soldier all displayed on screen. If both players choose the same soldier, that soldier is removed and another round of picking starts. If both players choose a different soldier, they both buy their choices, and a new round of picking happens. This goes on until both players can't buy a soldier anymore. There is no soldier limit per team.\n\n\n\nThe soldiers have 4 different attributes:\n\n\n* Price (5-30)\n\n\n* Speed (1-25) (each soldier has a different speed)\n\n\n* Hit Points (1-25)\n\n\n* Damage (1-10)\n\n\n\nThe game auto generate these soldiers, but obviously the AI tries to have a minimum of balance so players don't always make the same choices. For example, a slow cheap soldier with a lot of hit points would be too strong.\n\n\nOnce the picking is over, the battle starts. The first soldier to shoot is always the fastest one, and he always shoots the slowest enemy. Then the next fastest soldier shoots, and this goes on until the slowest alive soldier has shot. Then the process repeats until one side is decimated.\n\n\n\nThe winner wins elo points, and there would be match making to ensure fairness."

o15ksv,A puzzle game with a unique feature.,"""A puzzle game with a unique feature.""  \n\n\nThe main goal of the game is to escape an unknown dimension/world using combat and strategy. The setting would take place in a world similar to Monument Valley and gameplay-wise, it would be pretty basic. However, there would be the feature of shapeshifting/transformation.   \n\n\nBasically, players will have the ability to transform into a different creature/entity to assist you throughout the game, and ultimately, you **will** need them to overcome certain obstacles and complete the game. For example, you might need to jump over something that the main character can't. To resolve this, you could transform into the character that is capable of jumping over it. Each character would have a specific ability/task that it'd be used for (jumping, shrinking, pushing, etc.).   \n\n\nTo make this game more of a challenge, I was thinking maybe each level would be timed and there could also be a limit to how long you can stay transformed for every character. This would maximize players' ability to problem-solve and be quick at the same time.  \n\n\nAs for how you would get each character, I'm not too sure. I was maybe thinking there would be a combat system and to get a characters' soul, you'd have to kill them, but I don't know lol."
o13knq,A crypto currency game that can actually work.,"There currently is no crypto games that is equal to it's none crypto counter part.\n\nThe core of the problem is with the games economy. None crypto games have a strong economy because people spend, crypto games have a poor economy because players hoard the money.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo what if the game is designed, so that players can freely hoard crypto, the same way players will often hoard healing potions in other games and never use them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*That is to say the game should have a normal game currency*. It can be earned in game, can't be exchanged for money by normal means (users can still sell accounts etc.), mostly it is just there to play the game.\n\nThen to allow the player to hoard, allow them to buy assets. Things like cars, buildings, swimming pools etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWait this is sounding a lot like the Earth2 scam.\n\nYes, it was during researching the Earth 2 scam that I realized it solves a lot of the problems. Except they never designed it to be a sustainable game.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**See the fake in game currency is key to making it work.**\n\nBy using the fake in game currency players can edit their already purchased assets. Changing how it looks. Combine this with the fact that assets can be scarce suddenly the assets can increase their worth with the fake currency.\n\nNow players can inflate the value of a car, by buying a rare paint job for the car. People will want the rare car more and be willing to buy it from the other player for more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow do the developers make money from this:\n\nBy selling the fake currency developers can make money like any normal game. Yes it means there is the usual economic problems, with the extra crypto economy on top; but it overs new ways of creating inflows and sinks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor this to work as a crypto coin, players must be able to sell assets back to the game and get it's full original worth.\n\nIn short developers will not be allowed to take any money from the crypto stockpile or alter it's value directly.\n\nThe developers can only manipulate the worth of the fake currency; or the system will crash."

Still a mystery to me how MIB got their tech but i believe aliens gave it to them. Make money by selling patent of stuff like the microwave or what the mib does to gain money. \n\nIs this something that already exists? Or does this sound like a bad idea?
o10ec4,A Heist game about a small group of European criminals getting together to steal things,"There aren’t many heist games out their tbh and the heist games that are out their are kinda meh. Also i dont think there is a heist game with a story or at least i dont think so.\n\n\nFor the game I would imagine it to be a open world third person shooter with some fighting mechanics. I was thinking for the criminal group each would have a sort of role or specialty, Like one would be the brute who specializes in hand to hand combat and can take alot of hits, The Gadget guy who has the equipment needed to disable traps/ alarms and take out guards, and the leader who specializes with guns. \n\nFor the heist before you start them you would need to get the equipment or people needed for the heist which would be its own mission. Before the Heist starts you can select which plan you would want to.For the heist itself i would imagine your actions can effect the outcome of the heist alot. For example using guns or being loud will bring the police to your location alot earlier which would make the getaway driver unavailable which would force you to take a different escape route. There would also be a variety of heists like having to protect a safecracker so they can open the vault, having people held hostage to get what you need etc. As the game goes on each heist will get bigger and more difficult. I would also imagine there to be side missions like maybe stealing things at a much smaller scale,being blackmailed by corrupt government members to do some jobs for them etc\n\n\nFeel free to tell me your thoughts about this in the comments below"

At the end of that a winner is chosen for the round and they win a point, best two out of three wins.\n\nThere's no predetermined charts to compete against, neither is there a score system, the winner is determined purely by who the third player spectator thinks wins.\n\nThe third player is also in charge of the background setting of the match as well as the backing music track, meaning players will have to improvise their beats more often.\n\nIn the menu, players can choose their sounds to allocate to each button from a library of pre-made beatboxing sounds as a kind of loadout to keep every player sort of unique.\n\n you can practice your beats in a practice room attached to the ""beat loadout"" menu.\n\n you can customize your character with outfits and bling you win from matches( given randomly but never repeating after a win) from a custom character screen."

o0sog5,Need some feedback on the game concept,"Hello everybody!\n\nMy name is Alexey. I am a beginner game designer (currently just taking courses). I am from Russia, specifically from Siberia. I would like to present you with a concept description of my game and get feedback. I apologize in advance for any possible incorrect translation. My English is not very good ... (all complaints to google translate J)\n\n**Game description:** The action takes place in the future. The scene is a town littered with trash up to the rooftops. The main character is a small robot that can perform only the simplest actions. A great feature of this robot is that it can think. The robot develops, recycles garbage into resources, discovers new technologies for garbage recycling, improves them ... The main goal of the game is to return the town to its original form.\n\n**Genre:** Life simulator with elements of crafting, construction, RPG.\n\n**Technical implementation:** 2D graphics like in Stardew Valley and Graveyard Keeper\n\n**Topic:** Confronting chaos. Transforming the game world from disgusting to beautiful.\n\n**Setting problem:** The world is a dump. To transform this world requires resources and technologies that are not available at the start of the game.\n\n**Key elements:**\n\n* Garbage|resource - The main element of the game. What is garbage can now be converted into a resource using technology.\n* Technology - needed to build new installations and more efficiently converting waste into resources.\n* Space - At the start of the game, there is not enough space to build basic installations. To start efficiently recycling waste, you first need to build which of the basic installations is better to build (a crusher or a warehouse of that type of waste or a press installation ...)\n* NPC Community - There are still residents (NPCs) in the city who have already forgotten that their city was once a beautiful and comfortable place to live. The robot's job is to bring them back to normal.\n\n**Possibilities of the main character:**\n\n* Perform the simplest work of collecting and sorting garbage;\n* The ability to improve;\n* Ability to build facilities for sorting and recycling waste;\n* Ability to develop technologies\n\n**Gameplay:**\n\nThe player will control a small robot to transform the game world. In order to do this, it is necessary to find the appropriate technologies that are scattered throughout all locations. Accordingly, it will be necessary to penetrate into abandoned and littered buildings, investigate them, find samples of equipment.\n\nThe development of technologies will increase the depth of processing waste into resources:\n\n* Level 1: Scrap Metal - Pressed Scrap\n* Level 2: Scrap Metal - Iron Ingot\n* Level 3: Iron Ingot - Steel Ingot\n* Level 4: Steel Ingot - Steel Beam\n* ...\n\nInteraction with NPCs is also an important aspect of the game. First, NPCs give simple tasks to the hero, for example, bring 10 iron ingots. As the character and technologies develop, NPCs begin to give more difficult tasks, for example, free this building from garbage and bring resources, then this NPC will take this building and open a shop for something there.\n\nThe game ends when the last NPC finds a home and acquires a profession.\n\n**References:**\n\n* Stardew Valley - character management, crafting and inventory system, building system, principles of building the game world\n* Graveyard Keeper - Character Control, Graphic Style\n\nUnfortunately, at the moment I can not provide screenshots or a video, because the idea is still in its infancy and my skills are still not enough to create a prototype of the game. Therefore, I tried to make a clear text description and at the same time not make it too long.\n\n**Any feedback would be greatly appreciated!**"

Players have to conquer territories, gather resources, battle, and defeat each other. Each player’s action is guided by a set of physical cards drawn from a deck. The Nintendo Switch or smartphone would be used as the board, giving both, a digital and physical gaming experience. The players will be able to trade cards and decide what they want to do. Once decided, they will input their actions onto the digital device and the device would resolve it. \n\nGameplay - Each player gets 1 territory. Everyone trades cards and information as they want. Everyone discards until they have a max hand of 5 cards. Players with less than 5 cards then randomly get cards from the discard, if there is any. Everyone secretly and simultaneously selects 1 territory they control and discards all cards in hand of 1 type of resource to generate units. All discarded cards are shuffled and kept aside facedown. Whenever a resource is depleted, return all discarded cards to their specific resource piles. All units on the map activate: They move 1 space towards their sought terrain, then they fight everyone in the same space they are.\n\nThere are certain requirements to build units. \n\n1.	Mine – free\n\n2.	Attack unit – 1x food + metal\n\n3.	Defence unit – 2x food + metal\n\n4.	Airbase – 5x food + metal + wood\n\n5.	Air units – 3x food + metal"

Or omit that from somebody you don't like so that a more promising younger sibling can usurp them.\n\nTeach them statecraft so they can better manage political matters.\n\nHave somebody that's a bit of a punk? Put them in Chivalry classes so they don't become a problem later."
o0k91y,An evolution game based on skillpoints,"Sort of like irl millions of years ago where different abilities/skills got you somewhere different. Every 10-50 skill points used, your ""build"" could become available for others to start as. for example, a dude has put all his points to defence and his/her ""build"" has gained either hard skin or a shell, after reaching the 10-50 points used, people could have the option to choose the ""build"" and sort of become that species. and either continue the same strategy or deviate from the strategy and swap or put some points to the offense for example. skills could be for example: intelligence, eyesight, offense, defence, mobility and stealth.\n\nI don't know if this is in any way possible because I'm no game dev and don't know how ridiculously hard this would be or if even possible, but I got this idea in my head from TierZoo (a content creator on YouTube) and the ""Ancestors:humankind odyssey"" game (I don't think this would be a copy since that game focuses on only human evolution)"
o0fxsi,(Thought experiment) Creating a real island using topographical data (GIS) in an open world game,"Now, you may have heard before, terrain maps are modeled in Blender using geographical data. Can this be applied to an open world video game map? What would be the technical difficulties about this? Is it possible, moreover feasible? Can a modern system run it? Sorry if it is an obviously stupid question, i am very new to game development."
o0euij,What game would you like to see in the Bone Wars time period?,"So I'm thinking about developing my next game and I thought that a game set in the Bone Wars period could be very interesting. Basically, during this time people found out that you can find dinosaur fossils and two scientists got into an extreme competition to beat each other in discovering as many dinosaur species as possible. It got pretty crazy, as they would bribe, hire armed men, blow up dig sites etc. If you haven't heard about this I recommend watching this 10 minute video (it's really fun):  [The Petty Feud That Almost Destroyed Paleontology - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP_3PF-FOV0). I would love to hear your ideas of games set in this time period!"

o09no1,Question about world building,I'm making an rpg whats the easiest way to go about world building
o06uga,life/zombie/disaster game,"The idea is a multiplayer sandbox game where you start off as a civilian working a job whatever you decide you can choose when creating character and doing day to day things. hang out with mates etc. pretty much a life simulator game but eventually after some time a zombie apocalypse outbreak would happen where everyone's characters would need to run etc to escape the apocalypse. the players characters will turn into the zombies you are fighting creating more zombies to fight and the zombies you are killing are real player models. each server should be at different stages so players wanting to start fresh can and those who want the zombie aspect can run that.  \n\n\n**Life:** during the life sim part you can respawn and do what most life sims do. buy a house, car food and water. build a bunker in your back yard if you like. do whatever you feel you want to do. if you want to get ready for the apocalypse why not but the limiting factor should be funds. stockpiling guns and ammunition why not but people need to keep working to earn money and should be punished by not working. if someone wants go full bush and and live in a little wooden house let them but unless they steal they shouldn't be able to get mid to top end weapons.  \n\n\nIn the life stage of the game people should be allowed to respawn as much as they would like. when i say respawn though i mean end up in hospital regardless of the sort of injury to allow people to keep moving forward but it will cost them $x to be treated. if they cant afford to pay for the medical attention they have to respawn as a new character. maybe as a relative who inherits their stuff but new stats etc.  \n\n\n**Jobs:** most real life jobs should be in the game to some extent from manufacturing which give better crafting stats, paramedic which gives better healing stats all the way through to hobo. each job being worked will give stats towards the accompanying occupation. there should be benefits towards every occupation including hobo that will help during the outbreak. people should also be able to attend classes to level up certain stats as well but of course that costs money but could also lead them into making more money such as a manufacturer can create better items causing more income etc.  \n\n\ndepending on player numbers there should also be npc's that act as bosses or key characters in the game. medics should have to go out to where things have gone wrong such as car accident or robbery gone wrong. if someone commits a crime they will be reported but there needs to be some sort of system in place that can help the criminal get away with the crime if they do it well. if they manage to rob a bank and not reveal their identity they should be allowed to get away with it. when they are reported either by a player or spotted through cameras etc they should be sent through to the police who will be notified of the persons name and added to an most wanted list and essentially have bounties on them. the bigger the price of the bounty the more people can join in.  \n**Outbreak:** The zombies should be rather menacing when the outbreak starts. think war z when they're in New York in rush hour traffic. it could hit at any time and the players shouldn't really have an idea of when unless they work in certain divisions of military. at most they should have 10 minutes in the cities as the outbreak occurs which can be heard through normal means like radio tv etc. at this point people should be allowed to raid shops without joining a bounty list and money doesn't become a necessity at all. people can raid and loot whatever they want but the hordes of people should be pushing from inside the cities forcing people to run or bunker down wherever they are.  \n\n\nonce the outbreak starts people can no longer respawn into the current game. if they die to anything other than a zombie a medic with a high enough stat can bring them back within a short period of time but headshots are instant death with no respawn. a spectator mode should be allowed but players should be allowed to turn spectating on them off so that would prevent ghosting. to spectate a player you need to type their name in so as to prevent ghosting.  \n\n\nIf this gets too much backlash a party system with so many extra lives could be given to simulate people coming together as a group and play as a npc such as a family member etc who escaped with them. these extra lives could be given to people as they rescue npc's from situations but of course they would have all new stats and attributes.  \n\n\n**Post outbreak:** at this stage people should be dying off but i would love to see what people do at this stage. with the ability to fortify and build a compound to defend using vehicles etc and try recreate some sort of society or turn into nomads running from place to place. really this point is about thinning out the last of survivors to start the cycle over again. im eager to hear peoples suggestions on this as to how this should end. i feel like a forced ending like nuclear explosion would ruin this part but holding off until the last person is dead also feels like a bit of a buzzkill too. i feel like once the last group has had its last member die after no more respawns available should be the end of the game.   \n\n\n**World:** the world should be relatively large. I'm picturing semi instanced regions where there is a city in one or 2 regions that leads into towns and forests. as a regions zombie % goes up it starts to trickle into the other regions. as the world goes on wandering zombie hordes should start to travel around. these hordes should be able to be messed with by flares and explosions or loud noises in general. if a horde is wandering nearby a place players should be able to set off fireworks to redirect the movement of the horde towards the noise. church bells cars anything major like that should allow players to plan some sort of defence or offense using the zombies as tools.  \n\n\n**Other disasters:** As the game is updated later on other disasters could happen such as military takeover or natural disaster and the server rolls a dice to see which disaster it gets. this would keep players on their toes and tuned into the radio in game or watching the news for the latest happenings.\n\nsorry for the long post. I've really been wanting to see a zombie sandbox where players are in the thick of the initial outbreak. In a story driven game its always planned out and I've never really been able to enjoy the escape that much. although I did love how the last of us did their escape sequence but after the first couple of times you know what's going to happen when and it loses that something special. Please leave any other ideas or suggestions in the comments and I really hope an amazing dev picks it up.   \n\n\nIf you do make the game from my idea **please shoot me some credit** through some fun way in game e.g. browsing reddit in game on a laptop or on a billboard. some fun little easter egg. also feel free to shoot me a message if you have any questions or would like more ideas i've got more to this idea but the post is already long enough."
o04niv,A sports series that gives you compete control,Im thinking about making a sports game that gives you compete control of your everyday life from buying cars and houses to getting to your event on time but the game will have players starting off in high school and depending on what version you pick up would determine what sports that would be open for you but you would be able to associate with all players through out the game
o032mc,"Trying to create a unique MOBA, Part 2","Thanks to the few people who replied to my first post, here are some changes I think would make it better. \n\n First, I think we could have both of the old ideas in the game, and just make them separate modes . For changes to the first idea we simply move it away from being a team deathmatch and back to more of a MOBA, as I originally intended. We do this by making the goal of the game anything else besides killing enemy players; although it could work as a team deathmatch its just that I dont want to copy battlerite. I want to still make the goal something more unique than just destroying the enemies base, but I feel like a fast paced 4v4 two lane MOBA where you make your own custom hero is unique enough. Generally, I want this mode to still be mainly PvP focused.\n\n For the second idea I came up with a two ways to change it. Firstly it could entirely be a co-op PvE mode where you and your team of 4 get a certain amount of time to farm before a giant boss shows up that you have to kill. Second we could make it a PvEPvP, you on a team of 4 against another team of 4, both teams have to compete over minions and jungle camps. After a certain amount of time a boss shows up, Instead of killing the boss the team that deals the most damage to the boss by the end wins the game."
o02alz,Here is my idea of a dungeon crawler type game that I am most likely gonna make,"My ideas I have come up with so far are:\n\n* Enter dungeon, possibly fight monsters or be stealthy, loot, leave\n* Sell loot for gold coins which then you can use to buy upgrades and equipment\n* Obviously different loot items would be worth different amounts but item could also be worth more or less based off its condition, like damaged or pristine\n* Some upgrades could be Strength, Stealth, speed, HP, and luck\n* And finally it would probably be top down 2D\n\nPlease comment any other ideas you might have."
nzyivn,Tree simulator,"Control the growth of a tree from seedling to mighty oak (or other kind of tree). Decide where to grow branches, roots, leaves and fruits/seeds/flowers. The game has an above ground and below ground view. The gameplay is very chill/relaxing. Each season takes about 2 minutes. Challenges include expanding the root system to find new nutrients, competition from other plants, infestation with bugs or disease, etc. You can deal with some problems by killing off a bit of the trunk or branches and cauterizing with bark. Players could sort of prune or grow their tree strategically for artistic purposes (like a bonsai tree).\n\nCould be 2d or 3d."
nzwku4,"Silent Hill 1/ResiEvil 3 controls, Dark fantasy rpg elements (like Dark Souls) and a ""stance"" system like Bushido Blade type game","Title sounds convoluted but lemme explain.\n\nIn this game you would have the tank controls like Silent Hill 1, with a 3rd pov camera (exception being areas where a fixed camera would work). You utilize a stamina bar for every time you run, attack, dodge, and block you do.\n \n\n- You have 3 stats you level up throughout the game: Endurance (health) Attack Power (how strong your attacks are) and Agility (how much stamina you have). Theres 4 starter classes each with different amount of points put into all 3 (all starting at lvl 15). \n\n\n - Combat in this game is like Resident Evil 3/Silent Hill 1 melee attacking (however when you are in you attack mode you can still walk backwards slowly, so you arent stuck in place. Your attacks stagger more often and are quickerm to make up for the tank controls.)\n\n\n- Doing a jumping back dodge is an option too, which makes you invincible during the entire animation, but takes all your stamina, meaning you cant immediately attack. Guarding attacks is done automatically when you have the ""attack stance"" button held down (by attack stance I mean like in ResEvil you stand in place pointing your weapon). Guarding an attack will only take part of your stamina but will do less damage to you, making it so you can attack afterwards.\n\n\n - You have 2 stances for each weapon, a medium and a high (kinda like in Bushido Blade). Some enemies will also utilize stances and guarding. These enemies require that you guard whichever area attack they use on you, and attack the area they arent guarding. (Example: you see a bloodied knight raise his sword in the air signaling a high attack, so you switch to the high guard. It successfully blocks, taking stamina and a little health. He then goes into high guard, so you change back to medium and successfully hit him)\n\n\n - A few enemies will be crawling on the floor or ceiling, which means you must face upwards/downward to attack them. The up and down stance are their own stance, and doesnt hit a normal ""in front of you"" enemy. Some enemies, while not utlizing stance themselves, will have areas of their body defended permanently so you can only use one stance attack against them (for example, some kinda of demon whose legs and torso are stone, so only high attacks damage them.)\n \n\n- Multiple weapons can be found throughout the world (axes swords, bladed batons, daggers, halberds, spears, even ranged weapons like bows and thrown items) along with armor sets. Each starter class has a unique set of armor they start with that only they can use, but these armors all have the same stats. Armor is mostly cosmetic but each have some kind of upgrade, usually a +(#) boost to health or endurance.\n \n\nI have a whole lot of other things written down but I dont wanna over do it more than I already have in this post. Id love to see this game made someday. If anyone has criticism, questions, or wants to hear any more ideas for this (concepts, enemy/level designs, boss designs, lore things) id love to hear it. Thanks for reading."

nzmwfx,Second person storytelling," I need your feedback with our game project. Me and my team are building this adventure-roleplaying game in a dieselpunk world mixed with art deco aesthetics.  It’s still in the early stages of development.   \n \n\nOur main gameplay twist is that the game is second person storytelling ™. For us second person storytelling ™ can be described that you are playing as Watson in Scherlock Holmes stories, or Alfred in Batman story. This means that you play as support type side character, in a story revolving a hero that is larger than life. Translated in to gameplay this means that most of the decisions are made by the hero, and you cannot directly harm enemies, you just have to make hero survive by e.g. using smoke grenades or gadgets that fit the dieselpunk theme.\n\nThoughts?"
nzkb6s,a new thief game,"This is 3rd person rpg game . A reboot to the old thief series\n\nThe game takes place in medieval times and like the old thief games it has a little magic but its not full blown fantasy game\n\nstory\n\nThe game starts with a cutscene where you are a kid thats helping ur parents working in the garden feeding animals and stuff and a group of soldiers come to collect taxes from the kingdom . You parents dont have enough so they want to have sex with your sister and they wont take everything you have . The father says no and they try to take her by force , your father tries to fight them but he gets killed , your mother tells you to start running in the forest she gets killed aswell and your sister was caught raped and killed too \n\nyou return to the house when the night comes only to find you family's heads on spikes and house burned down . You go to the city and start begging for food when someone from the Thiefs guild finds you and recruits you . You play 1 or 2 missions as a child then you grow up . In one of ur mission as a adult you go to rob a house of one of the king's guard and as he sleeps you recognize him as the one that came for the taxes and killed your family . Here you have a choice  (1) either do your job and get out or (2) brake the rules and kill him\n\nIf you chose number 1. you kill continue to do missions for the thiefs guild , and eventualy become the guild leader, you will be able to decide what kind of jobs you can give to other and the main story will revolve around the war between the thiefs guild and the kingdom trying to save the poor and eventualy bring down the king \n\nif you chose number 2. the thiefs guild will abandon you for breaking one of the most important rules ( never kill your target ) and you will do missions that you can find around the city from tavern or just hearing people talk , the main story will revolve around a conspiracy that a group of necromancers will try to bring down the kingdom from within and make everyone slaves of the ancient evil religion\n\nThere will be other important decisions to be made and you can choose a side and be good or evil\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGAME MECHANICS\n\nMost important is that you can enter every building , every window every door can be broken or lockpicked as long as your skill will be high enough\n\nalot of parkour , climbing will be very important \n\nthe classic rope arrow , water arrow \n\njust like in the previouse game you can choose to fight with a sword but you wont be very good because of your skinny constitution , if you try to fight 2 people at once ur dead 100%\n\nchoice will have a great impact , everything will change around you as you make the decissions for example house from rich people can become empy if you rob all their money and you can see them on the streets poor \n\nYou walk around the town without a mask in places like taverns and look for missions , normal mission that will help you improve your skills will be in normal places like taverns and brothels and main story missions you will either get them by raven at ur house or by npcs in a underground world in the sewers"
nzk4nt,"Drag to Hell, a zombie survival shooter with Drag Queens.","Picture it, horrifying zombie outbreak. People dismembered and devoured only to rise up and join the undead crowd. Fires and explosions everywhere, but there’s only one thing standing against the hordes of undead tonight. Four fabulously dressed divas with weapons of mass destruction.\n\nGuns, glamour and guts galore. Want to take it close range with the deadites with a manniquin leg, wig head or a brick filled purse? Go right at it! Prefer a glue gun turned pistol or a confetti cannon full of shrapnel and glitter? Show these corpses how it’s done.\n\nDrag to Hell? Drag fights back.\n\nMy idea is a campy version of Left 4 Dead or Back 4 Blood with the comedy of Lollipop Chainsaw and a million and one gay podcasts, youtube channels and drag shows combined. You could pick from different classes of queens from snarky hard hitting queens with melee weapons, to sweet healers or even someone throwing shade from a distance with a rifle. Light that fire with a mech queen using a flamethrower to melt face off all these ugly undead.\n\nWhile i know it’s probably somewhat offensive, after watching shows like Unhhhh and Dragula, i’d kill for just some kind of a funny, gorey, glamorous zombie game thats all shades of colors and comedy. I’d gladly pay for an Triple A title like this, even double A. I’m just putting the idea out there to hopefully stir someones interest.\n\nPlease, tell me what you think!"
nzis2a,// [PvP] Gameplay Concept - Keep moving to stay alive,"The idea is pretty straight forward as the title suggests: In order **to stay alive**, the player needs to be **constantly moving**. Staying still drains health.\n\nI've found one party game that utilizes this gameplay, called [Move or Die](http://www.moveordiegame.com/) *(who would've guessed)*\n\nBut I haven't come across any other games yet, having this as a primary feature, especially in higher productions. More specifically I'd like to see this implemented in a competitive PvP environment, like First-/Third-Person Shooters.\n\n**My Game Idea:**  \n\[Intermediate-AAA\]  \nCompetitive PvP FPS (2v2, 5v5 etc.)  \nPlayers control humanoid robots running on batteries.  \nThese batteries recharge (or stay charged) as long as the Player moves (walking, running).  \n**Edit:** Movement counting towards recharging must be significant (travel distance), not AD strafe spamming. (u/Paradox\_Synergy thx for heads up)  \nAs soon as the Player stands still (or moves on spot), the battery starts depleting (fast).  \nMaybe even emitts a distinctive beeping sound for others to hear.\n\nThis should prevent exploitations/annoyances like camping or AFK and encourage a fast-paced playstyle. It would also mean, that there's no *typical Sniper class*, since it wouldn't make much sense.\n\nWhat do you think? Would you be interested in such a game?\n\nAny ideas or recommendations for improvement, expansion, similar games or else highly welcome!\n\nAlso, if you do decide to utilize this feature in your own games, please be sure to reach out to me.

nzczp6,An rts and/or grand strategy game about life vs machines.,"Okay so I have been thinking about this for a while now, but what if there was this game to where there are two factions. (maybe three) Life and Machines.\n\nThe life one is genetically engineered organisms, so you could have humans to have a perfect human form, and a cannon that is basically an intestine, a rhino looking thing that has bone/chitin/steelbone plates that can deflect bullets and just a ton of ideas that I could tell you about.\n\nThen you have the machines with like cyborgs and mechs and ai and all that stuff.\n\nSo for an rts you could just have units and stuff and it could be pretty similiar to starcraft or other rts games but I can think of a few unique features. \n\nAnd with a grand strategy game you could have it to where the different factions gather resources specific to what they need or maybe they can need the same thing, and you can have to where there are armies with specific units and they perform different things depending on the units, but its grand strategy so you control just the general army over the map.\n\nAnd you could combine both rts and grand strategy into one, as to where you control the map stuff like a standard grand strategy, then that stuff influences what happens in battles to where you can do the rts stuff.\n\nI've also been thinking of a badass trailer for the game to where it shows off some of the units im thinking about.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are a ton of ideas I could add to this, but its already getting long enough so i'll leave it here. If an actual game developer wants to make a game with my idea, then please contact me so I can tell you unit ideas and how the game just works in general. I just have so many ideas I want to talk about!"
nzcma7,Asynchronous single-player campaign missions played within large multiplayer matches. We can make it work.,"When I learned *Battlefield 2042* will not have a single-player campaign, I wondered if one could be added later-on by letting one person play a scripted single-player mission within the active battlefield of a live match. You know how some FPS single-player missions take place within a chaotic, active war? What if we do that, but the war is other actual players having a large-scale match.\n\nWith some tweaks, I think it can work. This is how:\n\n1. **The multiplayer mode is free-to-play while the single-player campaign is not (like Halo Infinite will be).** Even though the number of players in multiplayer usually far outnumber those playing single-player, this model will ensure there are more multiplayer users than single-player users.\n\n2. **The story involves a country using the war as cover for some secret plan.** In other words, your teammates aren't helping you with your mission because they don't even know about it. It's just you.\n\n3. **The missions are short enough that they can be completed within the length of a single ground war multiplayer match.** For reasons I'll get into later, the locations of your objectives are different every match. You'll have to get from point A to point B without dying, which can be difficult in the middle of a ""real war"" so it's important the missions are short enough to retry in a new lobby.\n\n4. **The large multiplayer maps have several doors and buildings that players regularly can't enter, except for the one person playing the campaign mode.** Any scripted cutscenes or events that should not be interrupted would happen there. You might enter one buildings, move through some vague underground system, and emerge from another player-only building for your next objective.\n\n5. **Dynamic story events would happen outside in the chaotic battlefield.** Sometimes the next objective isn't to get to another secure building. Sometimes the objective is outside ""in the shit"" so to speak, such as having to kill a villain that's escaping in a vehicle. Or you might have to trigger a dynamic map event like collapsing a building or destroying a dam. In situations like this, your teammates might make things easier or the enemy team might make it harder. But that's war. Someone on your team might unknowingly kill your target for you to complete your objective.\n\n6. **Missions are dynamic using some smart system to keep it as fair as possible.** If players guess who is the campaign player, some of them might troll the player. So the locations of story events, as well as the paths that NPC targets might take outside, are dynamically scripted to avoid (or sometimes approach) where the action is heaviest. Moreover, when the objective is to trigger a dynamic map event (collapse building, destroy dam, etc.) the smart system would have to pick one that hasn't been done on the map yet.\n\nLastly, the whole thing can be asynchronous as it needs to be. If the game needs to make you invisible to players and them invisible to you, while spawning AI enemies only for you, it can.\n\n****\nIt could be fun. It'll make replaying missions new experiences every time. It could lead to some crazy, by-the-skin-of-your-teeth missions for people to share replays of. And most importantly, as the developer you get to repurpose all the maps and assets that already exist for multiplayer instead of making those expensive single-player campaigns. Even AAA budgets can't keep up with those costs."
nzbwnw,Halfling-Nook (or Hobbit Hole if you can get the rights),"First of all this game- again, if the rights are acquired- has to begin with Tolkein's quote ""In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.""\n\nThe game could be presented from a number of perspectives - side view, first person, isometric. The point is, you carve out an underground dwelling and make it as nice and cozy as possible. Challenges include making sure your garden and pantry are full enough for any unexpected guests, keeping your place tidy inside and out, squabbling with neighbors and maybe even- to the chagrin of those same neighbors- adventuring in the area around Halflington at the behest of your eccentric wizard pal.\n\nI am partial to first person views so that'd be my preference- really get down into the coziness. A sideview would limit your dwelling, so maybe isometric with an option to go into first person to look around would be best. I would love this game."
nz7nhk,NEW GLITCH FOUND IN PUBG MOBILE,[removed]
nz7jlh,"In the process of creating this fighting game project with a horror/sci-fi/fantasy-like setting but I might have to break up the genre themes, I'd like some opinions first","Since this fighting game would consist of horror, sci-fi and fantasy themes, I was curious for some opinions on what others think of this. \n\nI had originally the idea of making this a straight up horror themed fighting game, with each of these characters designs revolving heavily on horror tropes, with a little fantasy and sci-fi elements sprinkled in. Then the other idea was a more sci-fi/fantasy fighting game with characters that are mainly a mix of sci-fi and fantasy characters, with a little bit of horror elements in the mix.\n\nI can either combine all the themes into one fighting game with a full roster of horror/sci-fi/fantasy characters. Or I can make two separate projects, one a full horror fighting game with some sci-fi and fantasy but mainly a horror fighter and one full sci-fi/fantasy fighting game, which is mainly a sci-fi fantasy fighting game with some horror in it and both would have a smaller roster each.\n\nSo the fantasy/sci-fi/horror fighting game would have around 20+ characters\n\nOr I go with splitting them and the horror fighting game's roster with around 12 something and the sci-fi/fantasy fighting game with around 12 as well.\n\nWhich seems like a better option?"
nz704x,Missed a major core aspect of my rhythm game idea for some reason. Gameplay.. hElp,"I was gonna make a pretty big post here, but I realised that the gameplay makes very little to no sense.\n\nIn the most basic of basics layman's term, you create a beat (made out of meters). Then the opponent would play it and they would give their own afterwards, but then I thought ""How the hell is that even gonna work?"". I originally thought you could just make it before joining a round, but that would end up making it sound terrible. \n\nMaybe you could make the beat during the game, but I don't know how you would make the ""beat"" in the first place. I also don't think that wouldn't sound very good.\n\nThere's one feature I wrote of which I have no idea what it means. But it has something to do with ""snappers"" which are rectangles that connect from right to left. I'm not sure if that was about the beat, or an setup thing. It was based off of a device that would snap to another thing and added a feature.\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nISTG my brain works on a whole new different wavelength. It's fine if you understand nothing about what I said."
nz561r,The Harlequin: A clown superhero game where you’re the opposite of the Joker,"Feel free to use this idea.\n\nIn this game, you play the role of the harlequin, which is similar to a clown.  You fight crime, help people in need, and carry out covert international missions in service to the free world.  Your skill set is similar to that of the harlequin in Dungeons &amp; Dragons: [https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Harlequin\_(3.5e\_Class)](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Harlequin_(3.5e_Class))\n\nStory: You grew up in a circus family.  Your dad was a lion tamer, and your mom was a trapeze artist. You and your siblings worked in the circus starting at a young age while being homeschooled (despite the fact that “home” was constantly changing from one location to another). Both of your parents were upset when you decided to be a clown, since they wanted you to have a managerial role in running the circus.  Your happy albeit hectic childhood was cut short when the FBI came in one day and started arresting the higher ups running the circus. Apparently, they were involved in organized crime, and were using the circus to launder money for criminal organizations.  The circus went out of business. Your dad ended up working as a dog walker, and your mom worked at a day care center handling games and activities.  Meanwhile, you continue to learn how to be a clown to help support your family, and when you’re 14, you meet a clown from Italy that teaches you the way of the harlequin. This is a form of combat that combines clowning with speed, martial arts, and combat tactics. Imagine James Bond, Jackie Chan and Jester the Clown fused into one. That’s you.  When you reach adulthood, you begin your life as a harlequin, committed to fighting crime, helping those in need, and protecting the free world from terrorists and tyrants.\n\nAt the start of the game, the intro and background story play. Next, you create your character, choose your gender and physical appearance.  You need to manage your career and your life as well. You can choose missions to earn money and gain experience.  Money is needed not only for better gear, but also for paying bills and other living expenses.\n\n* There are idle missions that involve actual clown jobs, such as birthday parties, where you dress up, leave your home to go do the job, and return home when the job is complete. These missions are a good way to earn money earlier in the game.\n* Crime fighting missions involve hunting down criminals and infiltrating criminal organizations, and you are paid by the police and the FBI to complete these jobs.\n* Treasure hunting missions involve more complex adventures, and the pay offs can be substantial.  You can earn valuable artifacts, better gear, and treasure to be sold.\n* International missions will take you all over the world. You’ll be fighting against terrorist organizations, mafias, drug cartels, dictators, human traffickers and warlords. Governments of different nations pay you for these missions.\n\nWith more money, you can buy nicer homes. You start in an apartment, but late in the game you might have an expansive lair.  The interior of all your homes will be carnival-themed.  You can even have romantic relationships with different people that you meet, get married, and have a family.  This is an action rpg.  As you defeat enemies, you gain experience, go up in levels, gain hit points, master new skills and launch deadlier attacks.  The Harlequin skills are more gear-based than magic-based, so in this regard the game differs from D&amp;D, although the skills should be similar.  Attacks include acrobatic martial-arts moves, as well as using light weight weapons and firearms."

nz3p9w,An MMORPG set in a 1-1 scale of Ireland,"Why Ireland? Its not as big as Great Britain, so much more feasible. Madagascar, Taiwan, and Hokkaido are good candidates, too. \n\nStructures? Literally everything should be player made. Very few to no pre-built or procedurly generated structures. \n\nNPCs? Viking and Roman traders that will wander the island and fight each other if they see each other. Also animals\n\nServers? Preferably one huge server, but it would likely need loads of servers if the playerbase gets huge. \n\nQuests/missions? Just a tutorial and starting missions. \n\nWhy this? I'd be one of the most ambitious games ever made, why not this?"

nyzqkg,Trying to create a unique MOBA,"I really love MOBAs and want to make my own, I want to create something completely knew but I'm stuck between two good ideas, and need your help deciding  where to take this game.\n\n**A team deathmatch MOBA** you can create your own hero to play as, choosing their stats, passive, spells, and everything else. Your custom hero is placed in a team of 4, on a battle field with only 2 lanes. The  goal is to wipe out the enemy team and win best of 3 rounds. When an ally dies they will turn into a ghost which give vision and can slow enemies by a percentage when they pass through them, the player can be brought back into the game if an ally revives them.\n\n**The MMOBA (massively multiplayer online battle arena):** you still can create your own hero, the map is still the same, and your still on a team of 4. This time however, you don't automatically start with your abilities and have to  choose them as you level up your hero. To avoid turning this into a farming simulator, and to speed up the gameplay, each  minion and jungle creep you kill gives you a whole level. There will be two different sides, the Raiders and the Defenders. The goal of the Raiders is to kill a giant raid boss, and the goal of the Defenders is to stall out to timer and keep the boss alive. It's sort of like a condensed MMORPG."

nytl3c,Crazy idea for a Nintendo fangame,"First, Make all the Nintendo characters REALLY transparent substitutes (example: ultra angelo the miner instead of super mario the plumber, the difference being angelo has a beard and wears a helmet), but have hints that they're actually the real, copyright infringing deals that got transformed by a curse by actual legal ninjas! \n\nThe second step is to make an arg depicting the affected heroes going on a quest though the multiverse (via the websites connected to the arg) to defeat the legal ninjas and restore themselves to normal! The final part would be an html5 game recreating a boss fight in the game, against the legal ninjas. Winning gets you a download link to mod files that restore the characters to normal, and the dialogue changing to reflect that."

nyi9x8,Simple idea: a fighting game with the professions of the real world. Every month/two weeks a new fighter is introduced,"I always liked the idea of party fighting games (brawlhala, super smash bros) but more so, games in wich the fighters were normal professions, so why not mix both and go on increasing the number of fighters? The movement set doesn't need to be very specific to all of them (brawlhala does this well. most of the movements are reskins) but it would be cool if they were\n\nExamples:\n\nFirefighter: bulky, can charge and run towards the opponent cancelling what they're doing and dragging them with him (reload time necessary), uses an axe to fight, special moves with water, can call a truck to run over people, and can use a ladder to climb without having to use the scenario. Moves slowly, but hits hard\n\nTeacher: small, can have a second of invulnerability while eating her lunch and this giver her health (reload time necessary), uses a blackboard eraser to fight, special moves with school supplies (pencil, paper plane), can scream to slow the opponent, and can call another teacher (during this time they fight together and can only use normal attacks). Agile, doesn't hit hard, but hits fast.\n\nAnd so on and so on. Having like 12 characters at the start is a good call, and then you add more regularly"

nyfu1a,Looking For Post-Apocalyptic Game Mechanics,"I am currently working on a post-apocalyptic survival game. It's mechanics are similar to the Last of Us, with a mix of DayZ and State of Decay. I have currently implemented a building mode, a power system and the ability to farm crops and livestock. You can build irrigation systems to water your crops, and if there is any sources of pollutants in the water source your crops will mutate and either have very beneficial or incredibly negative affects. You can search cars for resources, and the infected are very sensitive to sound (e.g. power generators), although this mechanic can be used to distract or guide the herd away from you! I am looking for more game mechanics that would make the game more enjoyable, I would love to hear some ideas!"

Let's use the Battle of Ain Jalut as an example. You can either pick the Bahri Mamluks, or the Mongols. Depending on which side you pick, you will get the respective armor and weapons, depicted as accurately as possible. You will have missions such as: Shoot the cannon, Kill off the enemies, Destroy the castle walls, etc. For the attacking side, there will be a timer. If the attackers manage to do all missions in said time, they will win. If the defenders manage to defend until the attackers' time runs out, the defenders win.\n\nThere would be many, many different battles all with unique maps and armies from different time periods, all as accurate as possible to history.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBrawl and server browser games could range from free for all's, deathmatches, team deathmatches to skirmishes and more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn Brawl and server browser games, you will be able to use a custom character using the game's cosmetics. There will be armor sets that are meant to fit each other, however you can mix and match. Colors will be editable too. You will also be able to pick your own weapons, facial features, voices and more. There would be a lot of customization, as in you could customize your weapon, your gauntlets or your helmet, or anything really.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe combat would be very free yet casual, not the usual click and the game does it for you kind of combat.

Once arrived you need to solve the job yourself. No levels, quests or something like a guideline. Just the simple ai will support you. But you need to ask the right questions. With voice control like with Amazon Alexa or with any terminal. What the job or problem is will be generated by the game. Is it a technical problem, a crazy crew or something from beyond? In the game all ships have the same components, but the game includes a really big tutorial because it is a lot to learn. This could be harder at the beginning.

ny2zc3,Survival game with built in difficulty mechanic,"May have been done before but had an idea.\n\nNamev suggestion: You WILL survive.\n\nBrief description. Futuristic space age, crash on primitive planet, have to recover resources to get off planet.\n\nYou have a robot companion. He's confined to the base area due to risk of running out of power ( very low solar output). He can construct and process materials. \n\nKey mechanic: If you ""die"" the robot brings you back to base and ""upgrades"" you. Broken leg is replaced with prosthetic that's much tougher ( so less fall/trap damage). If poisoned, liver is replaced meaning you can eat poisonous foods etc. So game gets easier the poorer you do.\n\nScore is done in terms of time it takes. Faster you get off planet, more people survive on planet. Each upgrade comes with recovery time.\n\nUpgrade ideas.\n\nLegs, broken from falls or snakebite or bear traps etc. Metal. Reduced damage taken, damage repaired on return to base.\n\nPoisons, shards in food? Etc artificial liver/kidneys/stomach. Allows more food types and raw food to be eaten.\n\nPrimitives attack, titanium skull, chest plate fused into chest, artificial heart/lungs more sprint time. Eye damage gives artificial eye ( out of robots head, he had two only needs one). Gives data on surroundings, highlights dangers etc. Arms give more strength gathering resources.\n\nMy thought was the upgrades are done brutally, bit of a horror aspect. The robot is there to see you complete yourmission and he/she will do anything to make that happen.\n\nMaybe as an ending, if the player refuses to do anything for an overly long period the robot rigs up an electric bike generator, puts electrodes in your brain, replaces organs etc and forces you to pedal to power him to recover the needed resources.\n\nLore? Robots have ai but aren't allowed to program anything to prevent ai takeover etc. So you're needed to install the parts to the colony, hence the reason you need to survive.\n\nThanks if you're still reading. Thoughts? Just thought the upgrade as you fail mechanic was fun."

nxvbat,Post-Apocalyptic Courier: A rather long trail,"Yes, I know this sounds suspiciously like **Fallout: New Vegas**. But it's actually inspired by 2 games: Death Stranding and Days Gone. Two games that had a lot of potential with their mechanics, but failed to utilize them to their maximum potential.\n\nIn the post-apocalyptic world ravaged by zombie hordes (yes, I know it's ZOMBIES again), delivering goods has become in high demand. *Not everyone wants to risk their necks venturing out into the horde-infested wasteland.*\n\nThat's where you come in. You're a COURIER, and you make deliveries via **motorbike.** Cars are too bulky and most can't manage the terrain. You navigate your bike through the wasteland, avoiding hordes of zombies along the way, delivering packages to other settlements scattered in the wasteland\n\nHere's the problem I had with DAYS GONE: **The Horde Mechanic**. It felt less like a mechanic and more like a gimmick: something that just ""exists"" in the game. It never felt impactful or meaningful to player progress. How do we change that?\n\nHave the hordes be DYNAMIC. When the player encounters zombies, there will be a chance that a ""scout"" can call for a nearby horde. Kill that guy or you'll have a horde chasing you in seconds. Let's also have a queen-like ""boss"" that can sick her pack of zombies on you. Also, trying to outrun a horde is now suicidal because unlike you, they don't grasp the concept of ""fatigue"". **Use the terrain** to your advantage, stay on the high ground always.\n\nLet's have the physical inventory from DEATH STRANDING, on your bike. And the extra weight can affect how you drive. Your bike can be upgraded with weapons, wheels, and even flamethrowers. Go wild. Death stranding's courier gameplay kinda felt slow and vapid. Was it for the best? Dunno.\n\nSettlements actually respond to your efforts. Making deliveries for a particular settlement means that they'll build and expand, meaning more stuff for you: lodging, workbenches, garage, even adding stuff in the world for you to use, like temporary camps, zombie traps, or ramps for your bike."

nxsehk,I woke up from a dream and wrote down the idea.,"I don't know about you, but have you ever imagined making your dream part of your creation? You have some dream and when you wake up you say... I need to create it. We often forget about dreams in a few minutes or hours as they are stored in a quick memory of our mind. One tip is to write down on paper the dream you had so you can remember it. I believe that the emotion a dream can cause can be a strong inspiration factor.\n\nIt's a unique feeling for an artist who is always creating. I myself have written down many dreams, which I apply in my projects. Sleeping thinking about ideas is also a great way to feed your mind for a good night's sleep. H.R.Giger himself, the creator of Alien, said that he drew his dreams. So, enjoy the imagination, not only of everyday life, but of dreams, the moment where we can collect everything we see and know from the real world and put that idea into practice through dreams. Get inspired."

The better you do, the more clues you get. If you mess up terribly, maybe you'll get wrong information in addition to making the demon more powerful and harder to exorcise in the future. I'm imagining a multiple endings type of scenario.\n\n\n Demons and exorcism are pretty universal concepts, so the setting in place and time is flexible. You could also switch ""shaman"" with ""priest"" and set it even up to today's time, if you wanted a Catholic angle. But I thought of this after watching The Wailing, so that's the kind of setting I'm personally picturing. Just thought I'd put this idea out in the universe, you know. \nThanks for reading 👍"
nxpnd1,I need you,"In my school, there is a mini-company project to create and I wanted to make it an indie game studio. If you want to help me, you can write in comments all your ideas (studio name, game ideas, mechanics, ...). Please take into account that I'll be alone to create this company, I won't have any help so don't propose me ideas worthy of a AAA game... Thanks in advance!"

nxkexe,"Metakinesis - A game in which you use telekinesis in any way you want (Inspired by movies/shows like Chronicle, Heroes)","The following is an explanation and description of an off the rails fantasy game set in the real world where you obtain telekinesis when you reach your 25th Birthday, you wake up with a terrible headache, you feel like your head is splitting open, This is a long read but is coming from pure fantasy. All descriptions are not real and are thus fictional. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe rules of nature:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou choose if you want to use your powers for good or bad, you can do many things of your choosing bad or good, but if you get caught you are doomed to be forever chased by the government and any higher authorities wanting to dissect you for science.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou can do all sorts of things in this game such as rob a bank, steal money from a grocery store register. steal gifts from crane machines ect if you choose but is not necessary. Remember the choice is always yours.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nyou start out doing small things that never get you caught like making a soda machine spit all its quarters out at once or an ATM spew all its cash out onto the street while you sit at a good distance away from the machine. you can fly too, but at first its very hard and difficult to control, but you eventually work up enough courage to fly toward the middle of the game and master the basics. you dont fly very high for a long time because of your inert human instincts telling you that your going to fall so you are very scared to fly at first for very long.\n\nYou keep a low profile throughout the game, you dont talk to people you dont know, you keep your face hidden from as many public CCTV's as possible. You keep communication to an absolute minimum, The less people that know about your powers the less chances you have getting caught. Remember they are watching. If you are recorded using your powers you will become a target and investigations will happen. You will be chased without end if you are caught, you will become the highest person if interest in the game until you are either dead or caught by the highest authorities.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you choose a path of enlightenment you can use your powers to help those in need. But you will not be treated like a super hero in the comics if you show the world what you can do, remember you are not to be caught ever using your powers not even if you are doing it for the good of mankind, The government and higher authorities will always target you no matter if you use your powers for good or bad, They want what they dont have, that is your powers and your abilities. The government will want nothing more than to dissect you and find out how you work so they can use the abilities you have for their own benefit like pointless wars for oil or to rule over nations with absolute power. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you must use your powers for the betterment of mankind you must do so inconspicuously and never be caught or seen using any of your abilities. The sort of things that you can do to help mankind are limited due to how many CCTV's are filming around the game world/city. So you must do so in secret without showing your face or voice. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne of your most special abilities in the game is being able to move faster than the speed of light by speeding up your molecular atoms and the rate at which they move around the nucleus, this however comes at a great cost to your health and wellbeing. You can use this ability to move so fast the time looks as if it is standing still (I.E. Einstein's theory of relativity). but if you choose to use this ability your cells will quickly deteriorate due to the rapid use of glucose for energy expenditure, (basically your cells cant supply enough energy to the now faster moving cells. you expend more energy than you take in). You must only use this ability for a very limited and short period of time. If you use this for too long you will die, If you use this ability often you will need to eat rapidly and very often. your caloric needs will increase exponentially. When using your normal telekinetic abilities you will need to eat more and rest more due to the higher energy usage. So the use of your powers always comes at some costs to you. But depends on how much you use your abilities throughout each day cycle. So it is important to gauge and understand how much you can use your abilities before your character becomes tired or ill. You must use your abilities in moderation. Remember your still a human in the game and still governed by the laws of nature. You must still eat, Drink, deficate, urinate ect just as a normal human would. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYour powers do not make you invincible though, you can still get sick, you can still get shot, you can still fall off a cliff. Some of these things can be stopped with the help of your abilities like stopping a bullet for example for falling off a cliff but stopping the bullet however would be nearly impossible due to how quickly a bullet moves through the air, This is when you might consider using your most special ability of slowing down time as to avoid a bullet traveling at thousands of feet per second toward you.\n\nYour goal in the game is simple, absolute freedom, you can do anything. each decision leads you on either a path of enlightenment or a path of power and evil. If you choose to steal, do petty crimes you will go down the dark path. But you can choose to be a robin hood of sorts, you can choose to steal money from the banks and give it to the poor and you will be rewarded with kindness and your abilities will become stronger and stringer, but if you choose the dark path your powers will not grow but will instead become harder to control the more evil and illegal things that you do. you can counteract the negative effects of the dark path by doing equally good things. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks everyone for reading, I wrote this just after watching the movie Chronicle for like the 4th time. So thats what got me really hyped up to write this. I think a game where you have telekinesis set in a GTA like world and having the ability to live out a completely fictional fantasy would be incredible. You have probably always imagined having superpowers like telekinesis and being able to do anything you want, the games scope would of course be massive, but what if???"
nxjsgd,GrimSim,"A cemetery management sim, where you have to manage terrain size, grave layouts, gardening, profits, the basic stuff management AND by night deal with ghosts, invaders (maybe people trying to take pictures on famous graves, etc...).\n\nI think it could work using a funny cartoon like theme or even with horror elements, which could result in very different games."
nxjqbt,A timer in the sky,"There would be a giant timer in the sky where depending on what you do, it would increase or decrease the timer. \n\nFrom what I’m thinking, it could be like a bright game with a very interact-able map. You can run around and interact with certain things that could change the timer.\n\nPerhaps like an achievement game with secrets and such?"

nxe49n,want to make a survival game but have no ideas,
nxa0nb,"Polishing 2D ARPG shooter featuring stupid guns, aliens, fantasy, and more","Core gameplay: Diablo has a baby with Enter the Gungeon with Hades influence: 2D with some RPG elements in stat/skill customization. You control a character, use a weapon: Weapons have randomized traits that make each drop different e.g. In the vampire level there are(among other weapons) Crossbows that fire a very thick projectile, but weapon modifier can make it shoot three, have unlimited ammo, leave a fire trail, explode on contact for a firey debuff on all enemies caught in it, make the arrows pierce... In the fantasy level there are spellbooks, maybe one launches fireballs, but modifiers include: It's now a frostbolt that slows, it's a lightning bolt that chains to enemies, it becomes an AoE rain field... \n\nIdea I had for melee weapons: Since melee in a game with lots of enemy projectiles can be very tricky, I thought of solving this by making melee weapons have some sort of passive life leeching when they deal damage, to sustain the inevitable damage you get from playing up close and personal. Any ideas here so the players want to use some type of melee weapon in a game with cool spells and guns?\n\nBasically, I want there to be many weapons with many different possible traits, so it has some replayability as some sort of Roguelite like Hades, where the drops you get change the way you run a lot. Maybe you get a simple sword, but with gold you upgrade/give it traits that include ""launches a piercing fire wave when it attacks"" and a different trait makes it ""attacks 3 times"" making the previous modifier to launch three waves, and suddenly it's a great AoE weapon, etc.\n\nYou unlock characters throughout the story, with different RPG traits or Roguelite modifiers (maybe the Alien always starts with a railgun, a Knight starts with a shieldbash ""Special ability"" but can't dash, a Pirate gets more money from drops but starts with a simple gun, a ninja gets an improved dash and moves faster...)\n\nPlot: Main character is an alien, escaping alien imperialism, and uses a portal to get to Earth when \[BBEG Alien Fascist\] decides to invade Earth because its got \[Cool Otherworldy Artifact\], and main character isn't very happy about dominating people. You get to Earth, but it's more of a fantasy D&amp;D setting (wizards, knights, dragons...) where surprisingly, the Alien MC fits among the odd looks and many fantasy races. You prevent their initial attack, so now they're hunting you (and whatever playable characters you unlocked in this first level). You decide to use your portal gun thing to travel to different points and gather the pieces of \[Cool Artifact\] before BBEG does. This travel method takes you all over ""Earth"", and has lots of different settings including: Vampire level, Pirate level, Zombie level, Blade Runner level... (Unsure if maybe the portal gun travels between realities and its not really a planet? I think ambiguity is a plus here)\n\nThe heart of this game will be stupid combinations of weapon traits and hoarding lots of weapons for different scenarios, not one-fits-all (so you want to have a great DPS weapon, a great AoE weapon, a few fun/strategic weapon like ""lay traps/slow zone..."".\n\nAny aspects to improve or where you can challenge me to explain further? What aspects of other games could I take to take this concept to the next level?"

He made a joke saying imagine every time you answer a math question you’re rewarded a picture with huge anime tits.\n\nI was think maybe a game where there are units like algebra, trig, calc, statistics... etc and each unit is it’s own story which has its own anime girl and plot. The only way to continue and progress through is to answer math questions. In the end of each unit there will be like a “final exam boss” where you need to answer multiple questions and if you pass you’ll be rewarded with a sex scene with that anime girl. And I was thinking of adding tutorials for each unit that’s taught by a vtuber like anime girl that shows you how to do the math.\n\nIt’s basically like HuniePop but instead of matching pieces, you answer math questions."

nwra1t,Ok I need ideas,"I'm a year 2 computer science student. I'm wanting to develop some sort of pc game that will be interesting to play. However, I'm dry on ideas, I want something not too complex but will take a while to develop. 3D or 2D I'm not too fussed. Fire away :)"
nwq7o9,"Open-world, Fallout 4 style DnD game","This wouldnt be a small task let's be clear, likely would need a Triple A studio for something like this. Or honestly a rudimentary version could be made In a Fallout 4 game.\n\nSo starting like Fallout does, you begin by choosing a race, class, then a point buy system for your stats just like 5e works. Instead of perks and such, it's a much slower and more adventurous style of leveling, and you can choose to unlock more skills in their class or level up in a different one to learn it's skills. \n\nSome things can be easily incorporated as they have been before in things like Skyrim or Dark Souls, like magic, legendary items, racial traits, abilities, and giant and unique boss fights with wildly varying and powerful abilities. Even combining magics, crafting items, and using unique solutions for things that really highlight the best of DnD have already been done it games like Spellbreak, the Dead Rising series, Just Cause and Crackdown \n\nFrom here, and just using the massive landscape of DnD in general, any number of imaginative stories, varying settings, optional routes and alternate endings for different playthoughs, and ultimately a lot of replayability can come out from this. A great imaginative mind with a willing studio behind them could weave something like this into a hit on par with Outer Worlds in my opinion.\n\nWhat do you guys think"

nwm4y7,My game concept," \n\nGreetings, colleagues! I want to share my concept with you. Leave your feedback if you are interested in this idea and have something to say.\n\nFeedback?\n\nGreetings, friends!\n\nToday I want to share with you my concept, which is in my work. In the near future, the team and I plan to start implementing it. But now I would like you to read it and give your feedback. I will be very grateful to you for this!\n\nWhen writing the concept, I looked back at the events of the last year and fantasized a little about what they might lead to in the future.\n\nSo:\n\nPlot: In the midst of an epidemic of an unknown and deadly disease, ordinary manager Andrew, who is immune to the disease, needs to protect his daughter and try to find a bunker that the government has built for uninfected people.\n\nGenre: Survival, side-scroller\n\nSubject: family. What the player is willing to do to save the hero's daughter. Is he ready to protect her from the horrors of the outside world, or will he tell her everything as it is and keep her in fear, so that there is no extra trouble with taking care of the child. Or still try to create a child's childhood.\n\nKey elements and their functions:\n\n\- Resources-gloves, masks, antiseptics, water, food have different qualities from bad to excellent. For yourself, you need to make a choice which resources we use ourselves, which we give to the child and which we sell;\n\n\- Karma System-the game world is divided into 2 main parts: the city center and the smugglers ' area. When completing quests for smugglers, your relationship with the merchants from the city center deteriorates, and the police will also be interested in you;\n\n\- Limited time - it is necessary to find information about the shelter in less than 300 days. After that, the city will be quarantined and all movement will be banned;\n\n\- Search for information-information can be obtained in various ways: by completing quests, buying data from merchants and smugglers, eavesdropping in a random conversation, but the main thing is that it can be unreliable, because for others the bunker is something of a myth\n\n\- Infection - when using low-quality resources or completely ignoring their use will lead to the fact that the hero will begin to spread the infection and infect the child\n\nThe main character's abilities:\n\n\- conduct a dialogue\n\n\- trade\n\n\- immune to the disease, but can become a vector\n\nGameplay:\n\nIn principle, the whole gameplay becomes clear from the information above. The hero is mining, trading, and exchanging resources every day to get information. The faction that the hero works with affects the world. If the player trades with smugglers, performs quests for them, the disease will begin to spread more strongly, as official merchants are closed and citizens will not be able to buy high-quality protective equipment. If the hero works with official merchants, which is more difficult, because he will get less resources, but only high-quality ones, then the smugglers will try to rob or kill him on the contrary\n\nRecommendations:\n\n\- This war of mine - color scheme of the world;\n\n\- Disco Elysium-extensive dialog system\n\n\- Mount &amp; Blade-Barter trading system;\n\nOf course, not all the details of the concept are reflected here. However, the main part is described here.\n\nIf you have read this concept and have any thoughts or questions that you would like to share, please do so. I will be very happy!"

nwhcy8,"If you like Pokémon and Fnaf, this my attempt at a possible good fan game series","(I am not a game designer so this will never be made. At least not by me. Maybe. idk) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFive Nights at Eevee’s Fast Food Diner! \n\nStory: In an alternate Pokémon world where all Pokémon live freely and can walk and talk like humans, a small town where Eevee’s and their evolutions live have a new establishment ready for customers. “Eevee’s Fast Food Diner”, a place for all kinds of Pokémon to come and enjoy some of the owner’s famous food and watch a show while they wait and enjoy. \n\nA newcomer to the town, a Sneasel named Chet, is looking for a job and decides to take the job as a night guard at Eevee’s FFD. However he has no idea what he’s going to get himself into. All seems calm at first, but once midnight strikes, everything goes to hell. The diner's animatronic mascots suddenly start moving and they seem to have a deadly look in their eyes, and Chet now has to try and survive the night as these animatronics come after him. \n\nShortly after Chet leaves, Stanley returns to his diner and finds it destroyed. With not enough money to fix and clean the place, he has no choice but to sell the diner. \n\nCharacters: \n\nStanley: Stanley is the owner of the diner and a real nice Eevee, at least to Chet he seemed like that. He created the diner because he wants to share the recipe of his famous PokéPuffs and Curries, he also created all the animatronics in the diner; they are supposed to be robot copies of some of his evolved friends in town. He tells Chet that he will be out of town for a few days and is glad he came when he did, since the last night guard quit suddenly. \n\nChet: A Sneasel trying to make a fresh start after being in jail for 5 months after doing horrible things while being a part of a group of very bad Pokémon. He saw the error of his ways and wanted to make a change in his life and he found himself in the small town of Woodpine and in the hands of deadly animatronics. \n\nPhone Pokémon: The Pokémon on the phone is one of Stanley’s best employees, a Hypno called Eddy. Eddy is never seen in the game, but he’s friendly enough on the phone to Chet. On the fifth night however, he is in the middle of talking to you from his house when he gets another call. After that, he never calls you back and you start to have a strange hallucination of a pale looking Eevee with black sunken eyes and red pupils, followed by the words “His fault” flashing across your screen before the night actually begins. \n\nAnimatronics: \n\nSparks: There are a total of five animatronics in the locations, but the leader of the group is a Jolteon named Sparks. He stands in the middle of the stage area with his two other performers. He isn’t active until the fourth night however, but he is not to be taken lightly, he can mess with the power by stealing it for himself or come to your right side door and will wait for the chance to strike. He likes waiting for his chance to kill you more than to mess with the power. If he does mess with the power though, you can give him a controlled shock through the camera he’s in so he won’t want to steal it and just use the controlled shock power to quickly appear at your office door. \n\nMoon: Moon is the second animatronic of the group, an Umbreon. He is the musician of the group and can play both the guitar and drums. He attacks from the left side door but can also cause the camera he’s in to go completely dark sometimes. When he’s by your door, he will wait for his chance to kill. Close it on him to make him go away.\n\nFlora: Flora is a Leafeon and the backup singer for Sparks. She has a poképuff with eyes and a candle sticking out of it she likes to take around with her everywhere. There is a way to know when she is at your door and that is when her poképuff will appear in your office and if it is on the left side of your table then it means Flora is on that side as well, same as for the right side. She will sometimes help with serving food to Pokémon who are celebrating a birthday or an event of some kind, always sharing a friendly smile with everyone. \n\nEmber: Ember is a little different then Sparks and his group. Ember is a Flareon that Stanley decided to give a pirate theme too. He has his own little stage called Ember’s Cove where younger Pokémon can go and watch a show and go on pirate adventures with him. He is a lot more deadly than the rest because he has a hook on his right hand to go with his pirate theme. He will stay on his stage and needs to be watched very closely or else he will surprise you in your office and give you the hook. He also has an eyepatch over one of his eyes and he can be pushed back a little if shown a light in his eyes through the camera. \n\nYellow Eevee: Yellow Eevee is someone that has little known origins. He was once just another animatronic Stanley made. He was meant to be another small performer that would entertain younger Eevees, but he broke down so suddenly and Stanley just left him alone and never bothered to fix him. He will appear in the office and nowhere else in the diner. What’s more strange, he doesn’t do anything to mess with you; he will just lay there on the floor slumped over with his head tilted down, if not dealt with fast enough he will kill you. Flip your monitor up to make him vanish. He seems much more lifeless than a robot should, what could have happened to him?\n\nCustom Night: The custom night is pretty simple, all characters except Yellow Eevee are set to level 20 and will be more deadly than during any of the other nights. However, if you beat the night you will be shown a mini game with two characters. A Eevee walking through the forest and a white ball of light following slowly behind. \n\nThe Eevee will stop halfway across the screen and say- “I didn’t want to.” Before he heads back to his house. The ball of light will then vanish and the mini game will end. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just want to say real quick, I have come up with a whole line of games to continue the story from this game. The story is pretty bland or simple or whatever the word is, but if you like this enough and want to see the rest of the game ideas let me know."

You would be an inquisitor roaming the galaxy looking for jedi to either kill or ""dominate"" and turn into a fellow inquisitor. \n\nYou could track down a single jedi multiple times and they could get away multiple times. Losing limbs and being replaced with robotic ones or maybe adopting a new fighting style to combat yours. I think it would be cool If you've hunted a jedi down so many times they get fed up with it and try and hunt you down specifically.\n\nOr hell I think it could still work in the opposite direction with you being jedi hunting down sith. \n\nI just really love the nemesis system from the Shadow of mordor/war games and really want to see it used in other instances."
nw5var,2D zombie survival,"I’ve had this thought for years, something with Metroid fusion style graphics and layouts, with a relatively open world that you can rummage through as long as you can make it to that location.\n\nSetup/world- overarching cityscape. warehouses, sewers, apartments, zip lines for fast travel once you clear your way to the top of a building. Left over military blockades can see outside the building from inside (not meant to be horror so much as thrilling) \n\nGameplay- scavenging and base set up for progression, clear an area, fortify it slowly go out and hope not to be overwhelmed. The ability to jump/ climb even a minor amount. You might have to wait on a bill board for a horde to pass so you can check a dumpster that’s 10 feet away. Fun weapons, slingshot that gathers ammo while you walk through rough terrain or break things(rubble) minuscule damage so you can unload shots for fun more or less. Leveled areas zombies regularly have so much health but some areas have stronger zombies making it worthwhile to unload 2000 rubble slingshot ammo on a high level zombie just for that satisfaction of doing it. Guns would cause zombies to come in from the background and just swarm the noise but usually a bullet might be one shot kills (helmeted zombies can soak bullets so they aren’t to easy) different melee weapons offering different benefits (dismemberment, knock down, blunt chance of insta caving in a skull, knock back, and so on) RPG mechanics maybe not leveling but a skill tree/ oblivion system. You get better by doing a certain action and resting in a safe place after gaining set amounts gets you increased aspects of your choice like a skill tree. Bases can be fortified in a tower defense style but zombies can bash it and break most things. \n\nStory-  maybe multiple stories to explore depending the route you go or no story and you just sandbox it and run around til you die.

nvsftx,"Rethinking Assassin's Creed: what could a current gen AC offer if it had stuck to its stealth roots, instead of becoming an open world RPG?","Safety and peace, reader.\n\nThis post is the result of me trying to figure out why I don't like modern Assassin's Creed games, and why I feel potential from the first game has never been delivered on. [As I've written on another sub,](https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/nquq0o/the_original_assassins_creed_feels_like_a_gritty/) I still think the first AC is remarkable and in some terms superior to its sequels.\n\nSo I've been trying to put into words and gameplay ideas what I *would* want a current gen Assassin's Creed game to be like, in a timeline where Assassin's Creed developed as a stealth-assassination game rather than as an open world RPG. **This post is basically my pitch of this hypothetical Assassin's Creed Sequel,** where a current gen game is made as a direct sequel to AC1, retconning all the stuff that's come before.\n\n**This has become absurdly long,** so I don't mind if you don't read it. I'm interested in what you think should be part of the perfect Assassin's Creed stealth game. Please refrain from mentioning my adderall. \n\nIt's also an exercise in tormenting ourselves, because it doesn't exist. Feel free to stop reading. As an antidote to the unstealthy, un-assassiny, collectathon Assassin's Creed games have become, this imagined Assassin's Creed Sequel (ACS) will (much like Islam) have five pillars: **assassination**, **social stealth**, **open world**, **the creed**, and **modern day gameplay**.\n\n---\n\n**AN ASSASSINATION GAME**\n\nACS should be as assassination-centric as Hitman, while maintaining what made the original so special to begin with: its **open world** and its **social stealth**.\n\nBut this means that ACS is a game which revolves around **assassinations**. You will not be collecting flags, buying real estate, or doing races. You'll not be swordfighting if you can avoid it, because combat will be lethal and escape will be difficult. You will be doing assassinations.\n\nThe flag collecting, real estate, races, and side missions of AC are all there to fill up the open world, which was entirely empty in the original AC a few weeks before release when they last-minute added some side content.\n\nIs an empty open world better? No. But in ACS, the activities in the open world should not be filler; they should all serve the core, which are the assassinations.\n\nIn the original AC, assassinations were protracted affairs, which began by scouting; interrogating, eavesdropping, and pickpocketing. This was done in a very linear, GTA-like style (walk to the dot and do exactly as I tell you). People didn't like this and in response, the series has shifted away from assassination preparations in this manner to more story-focused missions *in the same GTA-like style*. ACS will stick to assassination preparations, but will make them far less linear and unscripted. \n\n---\n\n**DYNAMIC INVESTIGATION**\n\nIn ACS, assassinations are facilitated through *intel*. I'll go into detail on Intel further below. Generally, Intel is information relevant to the assassination the player can gather or stumble upon in the open world. This intel can be gathered dynamically instead of linearly, because the open world too is dynamic, instead of scenery in which linear missions are set.\n\nIn ACS, the cities are not just filled with NPC's and guards. Targets are also persistent NPC's in the open world with their own routines and movements - with some unique events taking place only once. The player can either figure out these routines by tracking the target themselves, overhearing conversations, or by systemically stalking and infiltrating a target's Social Web. A target's Social Web inlcudes their lieutenants, their advisors, their confidants, their messengers, their servants and even their rivals - all persistent NPC's in the world going about their business, meeting each other in a chain of relations, with the target at the top. Just walking through the relevant city district will put you in contact with the outer fringes of a target's Social Web and allow you to work your way in. These are the people that will lead your investigation.\n\nEach city's Assassin Bureau or common rumours will give you tips on where to start looking, but in general, you will have to keep sharp eyes and ears out yourself - though eagle vision will lend a hand by highlighting such relevant NPC's.\n\n**Once located, members of a target's Social Web can be eavesdropped on, interrogated, bribed, or pickpocketed dynamically, at the player's discretion**. Each tactic, for each informant, will yield different results. The conversations between servants and masters may provide information about a broken wall - a convenient entry-point. The conversations between lieutenants and soldiers may provide information about a planned movement or appearance of the target. A pickpocketed letter may reveal discontent among the guards that the player can exploit. An interrogation of people closer to the target in the Social Web may provide better information, but the disappearance of such people will also make the target more paranoid and alert. Later on, players may also dispatch Assassins under their command to perform such missions for them. \n\nInformation gained through eavesdropping, interrogation, bribery, or pickpocketing of the Social Web is called **intel**. Intel is information that facilitates an assassination in the broadest possible terms; it contains the following kind of information:\n\n* **Opportunities**. Opportunities refer to a time and place where the player knows beforehand that the target will be present. This could simply be the target's heavily guarded bedroom, but it could also be a public appearance.\n\n* **Weaknesses** and **Strengths**. Sun Tzu says: the wise general seeks victory first, battle second. These represent things that will make an assassination more or less difficult. For example, if your target is regularly drunk in his routine, they will be less alert. On the other hand, it may be that the target has secret police undercover in the crowd, who could spot you while you think yourself still hidden. Some of these can be exploited beforehand, allowing you to set up a succesful assassination before you move in to strike. This could be a charismatic mercenary captain who, if bribed or assassinated, drastically reduces the number of guards at a target's public appearance, for example. It could be a propagandist without whom the public will start to resent the target, causing trouble and distracting the guards at a public appearance.\n\n* **Entrances**. Entrances are only relevant for non-public assassinations. If the target will not leave his fortress, this information will be relevant. \n\n* **Escapes**. These are mainly relevant for non-public assassinations again; however, with proposed tweaks to combat and escape difficulty (below), planning your escape route ahead of time may be worth your while.\n\n* **Aid**. These represent potential allies; forces that you could persuade to help you when the time to strike has come. Be they discontent soldiers, oppressed minorities, or rival nobles.\n\nAll this information can be gathered dynamically through the Social Web, through overheard rumours, or through the player's own scouting around. Furthermore, while there is *Intel* with a big I which will get stored in player databases for review, some information can be only overheard or seen or concluded by the player themselves and which will require attention to detail since they are information *the player* notices, but which are not spoonfed (or tracked) by the game.\n\nThe Social Web means that creators will have to create characters, animations, and dialogue same as in more linear Assassin's Creed games; the largest difference is not what content they create, but how the player is presented with that content. In this way, it is very doable. For example, say a local underworld figure meets with the target's messenger every week, only one conversation need be written and animated, since it only has to be rendered for the time the player attends this meeting.\n\n---\n\n**DYNAMIC ASSASSINATIONS**\n\nIn old AC, assassinations could go wrong; you could get spotted and have to kill your target in a swordfight rather than a perfect surgical strike. In ACS, such a failure will impact the assassination effect. This is the effect an assassination will have on the city, your other targets, and your fellow assassins. \n\n*City*\n\nSome of AC's sequels have introduced dynamic changes in cities; in Brotherhood, for example, Rome went from a depressing, poverty-ridden hell-hole to a bright, prosperous place when Ezio rebuilt it. This was a very cool and visible way to show the impact of Ezio's actions on the city; in ACS, such developments will be assassination-driven, not renovation-driven.\n\nIn ACS, cities and city districts have a number of meters which influence its appearance, its crowds, guard behaviour, and certain events. These meters are the **CHAOS** meter, the **CORRUPTION** meter, the **OPPRESSION** meter, and the **PROPAGANDA** meter. The Corruption meter represents financial inequality; the fuller it is, the more dilapidated the houses will be and the more destitute and desperate its citizens. The Oppression meter represents armed oppression by the target and their faction over the populace; the fuller it is, the more street intimidation by guards there is and the less freedom the populace (and you) have in certain area's. The Paranoia meter is part of the new notoriety system and represents the target's awareness that an Assassin is stalking them. The target's men will be more suspicious and more numerous, including undercover as citizens. The Propaganda meter represents the populace's indoctrination into believing the target's influence is positive. The CHAOS meter represents the aftermath of violent events, when panic, lawlessness, and riots grip the city and only slowly subside; such events include succesful or failed assassinations. When chaos is high, shops are closed and the Social Webs of other targets are disrupted.\n\nThese meters interact with each other. If the propaganda level of a district is very high, there will be much more chaos when the target is killed, because they were a beloved part of the community.\n\nTargets have specific stats by which they contribute to one or more of these meters; **this is why they are targets**. Their presence contributes to corruption and/or oppression in a bigger or lesser way (or more rarely, chaos). Assassinating them drops these levels, bringing balance and peace closer to the city.\n\n*Targets*\n\nOther targets can be impacted by assassination. An especially brutal and public assassination will make other target's PARANOIA spike up, which means that their men will be more alert and more numerous, and that more area's become off limits. Such a system was scripted at a certain story point in AC one and functioned as the ""notoriety system"" in AC2 and Brotherhood. The first one was very static; at a certain point guards would insta-spot you - while the second one was way too dynamic, where ripping down four wanted posters would make guards forget about you again.\n\n*Assassins*\n\nYou are an assassin, and you must follow the creed. Tradition demands that you strike with your hidden blade and kill your target in public. If you fail to uphold the way of the assassins and to display your RESPECT FOR THE CREED, you will disappoint your mentor and cause discontent among the assassins under your command. This leads to less rewards from your mentor and to less access to assassin allies and informants or other facilities such as shops.\n\n*How to assassinate?*\n\nAlthough some assassinations will come with specific directions from your mentor, in other cases you are free to execute the assassination you desire: in public, in private; with the hidden blade, from a distance, through poison; perhaps even make it look like an unfortunate accident.\n\nThe crux here is that different types of assassinations have different consequences. An assassination in private will lead to less chaos and paranoia, and will leave you less notorious as less witnesses have seen you; an assassination that looks like an accident leads to no chaos or paranoia at all. This means that subsequent assassinations will be easier. On the other hand, such assassinations go against the Creed; they are a coward's weapon, and a low respect for the creed will leave you unable to access gear and robes intended for higher rank assassins.\n\n---\n\n**SOCIAL STEALTH**\n\nThe original AC was unique in its stealth. Not only was it open world, it also was not based on line of sight (like almost every other stealth game) or on disguises (like the assassination-focused Hitman series), but on hiding in plain sight, remaining an anonymous blade in the crowd. Furthermore, the promotional material and in-game missions focused on the public execution of the targets. The perfect Hitman assassination looks like an accident with no witnesses; the perfect Assassin's Creed assassination is a bloody spectacle with a huge audience. In this sense it is stealthy until it isn't anymore.\n\nSocial stealth in AC is determined through *low profile* and *high profile* actions. In later AC's, the importance of low profile is lessened. In the original AC, just climbing a house would cause inordinate unwanted attention, whereas in later AC's, little else than lethal action would cause a guard to become hostile. In general, the social stealth system could use a more gradual approach beyond unaware / suspicious / aggressive. In RDR2 for example, minor offenses would cause the law to demand you leave, rather than invite the intent to kill.\n\nACS has two detection systems. The first is the kind of **ATTENTION** the guard gives you: **unaware / aware / attentive / policing / aggressive / chase**. **Unaware** means that you are either not visible to the guard or are blending into your environment. **Aware** means that the guard can see you but is not otherwise interested. **Attentive** means the guard is watching you because you did something socially unacceptable but not illegal. In the **policing** state, you have done something illegal or bothersome; a guard will demand that you leave, but will not attack unless you ignore him. **Aggressive** means the guard is engaging in combat with you. **Chase** means the guard is attempting to close distance with you and attempting to guess your trajectory when you break line of sight.\n\nThe policing response is a vital addition to the Assassin's Creed escalation of violence as shown in the first Assassin's Creed trailer; from hidden in the crowd to shoving your way forward to killing the target. The guards are an order-keeping force, not a military, and will not immediately use lethal force in response to a threat. Unless the guards are on the alert, aware of a lethal assassin threat, their first response to a non-violent high-profile action will be a policing response. The HEAD button should allow the player to attempt to defuse the situation or apologize.\n\nThe second detection system is how quickly the guard will **IDENTIFY** you as a threat or an assassin, which is related to notoriety and paranoia. These have three stages: **unaware / aware / suspicious**. Guards who are **unaware** are not on the lookout for an assassin and will treat you as they would treat anyone else; only violence will provoke violence. Guards who are **aware** of an assassin will recognize you only if you draw their attention and they can see you for a set amount of time while they connect the dots. Guards who are **suspicious** are on the lookout, will recognize you quicker, and will do so even in low profile if you are too close to them. The status of a guard should be visible from their idle animations.\n\nGuards who have been aggressive towards you recently will remain suspicious for a while. You can't kill a guard's friend, hide on a bench, and then pass the same guard a minute later.\n\nThe combination of these two systems, of ATTENTION and IDENTIFICATION determines a guard's response to you. \n\nTo escape combat, you must simply remain in the unaware / aware bracket of the ATTENTION system long enough. Whether you do this by hiding physically in haystacks (or new hiding places such as dark side alleys or doorways) or by blending with the crowd is irrelevant.\n\nACS should include AI improvements for guards to make them follow your ""last known position"" and ""last known trajectory""; meaning that if you dash into a street, then immediately hide or blend in near a market stall, pursuers should not immediately begin searching, but assume you have run down the street and continue pursuit, running past you, before entering searching behavior.\n\n*Context Stealth*\n\nThe AC series has a very simple blending/hiding system: either you are hidden (in a haystack, on a bench, in a crowd), or you are not. \n\nBut because social stealth is not so much about visibility as it is about inconspicuousness, there should be degrees of blending, based on the context the player is in. These degrees of blending influence the distance at which you are hidden and the time it takes for a guard to notice you (if they are aware / suspicious.)\n\nFor example; the player should not only be blended in a tight group of four people, as in AC2 and onward. A semi-full street of people should also already make the player more blended than an empty street. Instead of the player being blended or not, the player should have degrees of blending based on how many people are around him. This would make crowd stealth more intuitive rather than trying to keep the network of lines on the ground there.\n\nSpecific kinds of NPC's should also be engaging dynamically in not socially acceptable behaviour, such as thieves, beggars, drunks, and thugs. Such NPC's should act according to their own AI impulses which could dynamically create distractions. \n\nFurthermore, the player should be able to blend in other contexts as well. For example, the player should be more blended when standing near a shop and facing away from the street, as if browsing. The LEGS button, if pressed while standing still, will become a BLEND action again like in AC1, but it will be context specific; the assassin will perform an animation appropriate to their environment; be it talking, sitting down, leaning against a wall, pretend to shop, pretend to be a monk, etc.\n\n*The hood*\n\nIn AC1, the player's robes afforded him the possibility to blend with a group of monks. In ACS, the player could unlock different Assassin uniforms as they move up in rank. Each uniform could allow the player to more easily blend into specific contexts and crowds. A low-rank uniform could fit in well with dock workers, for example. This could be a tactical choice if the player can switch between them, but it could also be a developing difficulty if the player can't pick lower-rank robes, as more opulent / monastic-looking robes blend in with rarer groups of people.\n\nACS will also add the option of the player to put their hood up and down by pressing triangle. Hood / no hood represent essentially two different descriptions that guards will be looking out for. However, there are slight differences. If guards are looking for your hood, they will overlook you if you are not wearing a hood. Yet if they are looking for you without your hood, they have seen your face, and will eventually recognize you even if you are wearing the hood. It is therefore better to wear the hood before going into situations where you risk aggravating the guard. Getting into violent situations with the guards while wearing your hood means they will be quicker to recognize you *only when you are wearing the hood*.\n\nIf you are chased, changing your hood while out of sight during a chase increases the effectivity of blending. The guards are looking for someone with a white hood and would perhaps overlook the customer browsing the nearby stall quicker if he did not wear a hood at all. The same goes for the other way around.\n\nHigh level robes may come with capes or cloaks which one can wear thrown over the shoulder or covering the entire body. By combining changes of cloaks and hoods, players can effectively change their appearance on the fly - but this will only hold up under very, very fleeting scrutiny. It is only fit to escape guards who have lost line of sight and are in the chase; it will not work long against guards who are aware they have lost you and are actively searching for you.\n\nAt high notoriety levels, the hood itself may be something the guards are looking for - depending on how you were dressed when you committed the assassinations you are notorious for.\n\n*Notoriety*\n\nNotoriety works through three ways. These are **PARANOIA, FAMILIARITY, and INFAMY**.\n\n**PARANOIA** represents a target's fear that an assassin might come for them. It is generated through (bloody) assassinations of other targets and the assassination of members of the target's Social Web. Paranoia heightens the speed at which guards will identify you as an assassin, and increases their presence on rooftops and the amount of restricted area's. A target's paranoia only has these effects on guards / soldiers under this target's command. Paranoia does not drop.\n\n**FAMILIARITY** represents how often you draw attention through socially unacceptable or conspicuous actions. It is generated through doing these in front of guards and, to a lesser extent, civilians. Familiarity drops on its own, but high familiarity makes blending more difficult, and makes it likelier that guards will approach you with policing behaviour (""not you again""). Familiarity is district-wide and encourages players to take a slow and methodical approach.\n\n**INFAMY** represents how well-known your assassination actions are. It determines how suspicious soldiers are. It is a sliding scale. At lower levels, ordinary guards remain unaware, with only high-ranking guards being aware of an assassin. At medium levels, ordinary guards will be aware, with only high-ranking guards being suspicious. At high levels, all guards are on the hunt for an assassin.  A few citizens may even recognize you. They will make a ruckus, which essentially makes you as noticable as a high profile action to any guards present. Infamy drops over time, and can be lowered by killing propagandists - *without witnesses*.\n\nNotoriety-adjacent mechanics are **TERROR** and **JUSTICE**. Terror is generated by bloody assassinations and by combat kills without taking damage. The higher your TERROR is, the higher the chance that guards will not even want to engage you and will simply run away. However, a very high TERROR will also increase your INFAMY, making stealth harder.\n\n**JUSTICE** refers to how you are perceived by the populace. Killing only targets with a low propaganda rating increases justice, as do nonlethal takedowns of guards. Killing guards (unless oppression is high) or civilians drops your justice rating. Guards are also just ordinary men doing their job, and their deaths are an affront to the people. With a high justice rating, sympathizers in the crowd may come out to aid you in combat or delay the guards during an escape.\n\n---\n\n**THE CREED**\n\n*Stay your blade from the flesh of the innocent.\n\nHide in plain sight.\n\nNever compromise the brotherhood.*\n\nThis is the Assassin's Creed. You must show your RESPECT FOR THE CREED if you are to keep the trust of your mentor and the obedience of the assassins under your command.\n\nThis means that ideally, only the target dies, you are not detected unless it ends in the death of the target, and that you do not disobey your mentor or let assassins under your command die.\n\nThere is another, unspoken part of the Assassin's Creed, which is that assassinations should be performed with the hidden blade and in public. These assassinations are acts of justice and necessity, done proudly and boldly in the light of day, not in secret as if shameful.\n\n---\n\n**PLOT AND SETTING**\n\nGenerally, this could be anything. However, in the spirit of AC1 I would like it to be A) set not more than 200 years from AC1 and B) include the Islamic World, which jells better with the real-world Assassins as an Islamic sect. On the other hand, Christians should be present because this jells better with the real-world Templars. Personally, I think a focus on Persia and/or the Balkan would be a good fit. Baghdad should definitely be one of the cities involved; Armenian cities could be the Christian areas. If set in Baghdad, the Mongol Invasion could be a threat in the storyline. But this invasion happened, so it is not something easily introduced as the ""threat to be defeated"", since it wasn't defeated.\n\nAlternatively, Al-Andalus during the Reconquista would be a fascinating setting, allowing the player to explore both Christian area's such as the Kingdom of Leon, including cities such as Leon or Castille, Iberian Islamic cities such as Cordoba (Qurtuba), and North-African Islamic cities such as Casablanca (Anfa).\n\nIn terms of plot, it would be great to revisit the themes of ambiguity and neither the assassins or the templars being good or bad. What would be ideal would be if the player, through the development of the game, gets access to tools to achieve his goals of lowering corruption and oppression in a city that are very effective, but that run counter to the Assassin's goal of individual freedom and peace. The twist in the first game was that Al-Mualim had actually harboured goals similar to Templars; in Assassins Creed 3, there is a twist where your character has been a Templar all along - but what if the game actually has the player become Templarist in their own way?\n\nTemplar and Assassin are not just clearly delineated groups in AC1; they are ideologies, means and methods. Al-Mualim was a member of the Assassins but a Templar in his aims. Could such a development be possible for the player character?\n\nIt would be interesting to confront the templars not as targets, but as rivals, seeking to get rid of your targets as well. This is after all what the games are about: they share goals, but not methods.\n\nIn terms of progression, the game should begin with a few assassination targets given to you by your mentor, then ramp up to assassinations with specific requirements. The final third of the game should see the player with a large-scale goal to lower corruption and oppression in a city and to approach this in the manner they see fit: work out who contributes to corruption and oppression, and who deserves to die. In effect, the player should be free to pick their own targets and plan their own assassinations.\n\n**MODERN DAY STORYLINE**\n\nThis is honestly the hardest part of imagining an Assassin's Creed sequel and it is also where games later in the franchise dropped the ball the hardest.\n\nWhere does AC leave us in terms of modern day plot? \n\n* It has been revealed that there are incredibly advanced technological artifacts that predate modern humanity. \n\n* Desmond is still at Abstergo, but Lucy is revealed as an Assassin.\n\nAC's developments here have been:\n\n* Humanity was created as a slave race by the ancient civilizations, who were wiped out by a solar catastrophe that now threatens the world. Desmond and team must stop this apocalypse.\n\n* Lucy helps Desmond escape Abstergo at the start of the game and Desmond meets two other Assassins.\n\nI propose that ACS changes these developments. It should keep the reveal of the ancient civilizations having created humanity as a slave race (although deal with it differently), but **ditch the apocalypse plot**, for the following reason. The reveal of humanity as a slave race **ties in with AC's themes of freedom and control**. The apocalypse plot does not. So while it adds a threat to the modern day plot, it destabilizes the narrative themes.\n\nFirstly, the reveal of humanity as a slave race must be dealt with differently. Most importantly, I feel that individual members of the first civilizations **should not be shown**. Like the monoliths in 2001: A Space Odyssey, it is more effective and striking to show the unimaginable and clearly non-human creations of the forerunners than showing what they look like. It should be revealed second-hand, through images, ruins, or records - not through a hologram that shows a forerunner woman.\n\nThe apocalypse threat should be done away with entirely. Instead, Abstergo and their striving for world domination should be the main threat. This ties into the themes of freedom and control, and it is a clearly understandable threat. We know about the pieces of Eden as tools of control; we know what is at stake. How are the pieces of Eden, tools for controlling humans, going to help against the solar apocalypse? We don't know. With Abstergo as the main threat, the stakes are clear: they must not get the pieces of Eden, because they could enslave humanity. The modern day plot should revolve around finding and destroying the pieces of Eden -- and about the temptation of using them against Abstergo. Being a Templar is not just being a member of Abstergo: it is seeking to control your fellow man. In the fight against Abstergo, Desmond's allies may easily fall to that temptation. A fertile ground for drama and ethical dillemma's.\n\nIn synergy with making Abstergo the main threat, ACS should set up Desmond's escape, allowing it to take place at the game's end or at the beginning of the game's final act. To show the power and threat of Abstergo, the escape should be an immensely difficult and complicated feat that the player works towards throughout ACS. You can't just walk out. \n\nThe modern day Assassins should not be the scooby gang. They should be as they are in Masyaf: bad ass and borderline unethical operators, but with modern day armaments. They should look and act as if they walked out of a Christopher Nolan movie. Portraying the Assassins as they ought to be in the modern day will be difficult for the engine as firearm mechanics are not really present, so it would make sense to portray them sparingly, and spend more time communicating with them in secret while preparing your escape, perhaps through holes in the Animus system, similar to the messages Subject 16 leaves behind in ACII.\n\nThe final escape from Abstergo should test free-running (while escaping) and crowdblending (in the city). To be a believable conflict in modern times, the Assassins and Templars will have to use firearms, but Desmond does not have experience using these; either personally or from the bleeding effect, so it is those qualities that should be tested (or perhaps part of the escape preparations would be Lucy secretly having Desmond train firearm skills in the Animus). A cool final boss *test* of the stealth skills developed throughout the game would be for Desmond to kill Vidic, either at Abstergo, during the escape, or at his home.\n\nAdditionally, it would be cool if Vidic is killed (perhaps off-screen) by Abstergo, to emphasize the threat and ruthless nature of the corporate Templar machine.
