mlujhx,A spiritual successor to Atari's Godzilla video games that features updated characters and a new story,"Some of you may be familiar with Atari's three (technically four) Godzilla video games; Godzilla: Destroy All Monsters Melee, Godzilla: Save the Earth and Godzilla Unleashed. This spiritual successor would be set in the same continuity but would be updated to reflect the current state of the Godzilla mythos. The Godzilla used in this game would be the now-iconic [MonsterVerse](https://godzilla.fandom.com/wiki/Godzilla_(MonsterVerse)) version of the character, rather than the [Godzilla 2000/Millenium](https://godzilla.fandom.com/wiki/Godzilla_(G2K)) era version of the famous kaiju. \n\nAs for the plot I can't really give much of an idea for it, but I would like to see a return of the Vortaak (who are an alien race exclusive to the Atari Godzilla games and are the main antagonists). My personal idea for a plot would be that the various alien races featured across the Godzilla series have banded together into a sort of federation (with the Vortaak being the lead race) in order to conquer Earth with their combined forces. The Xiliens would provide Monster X/Keizer Ghidorah, the Kilaaks would provide mind-control technology to aid in the enslavement of Earth, the Mysterians would provide Moguera, the Nebulans would provide Gigan, the Seatopians (although not an alien race but an Earth race seeking to overthrow humanity) would provide Megalon, Yog would control the minds of three kaiju, and the Black Hole Planet 3 Aliens/Simians would provide Mechagodzilla 1.\n\nAs for the gameplay, I think it should be based on the gameplay of Godzilla: Save the Earth and the PlayStation 2 port of Godzilla Unleashed in particular. The satisfying hits and the ability to actually launch enemy kaiju with attacks is much more satisfying than the clunky fights in Godzilla Unleashed on the Wii (And that's not even mentioning the dumb extra life mechanic, manual energy charging, and the moon gravity jumping from GU Wii. Every kaiju should have one healthbar only so battles don't feel drawn out. All three of the mechanics I mentioned shouldn't be included in this game). I'd like to see much more detailed building destruction physics, humans on the ground of cities that would flee from the kaiju and could be stepped on and the like, and I'd up the gore and violence to reflect the MonsterVerse movies as well as the entries from the Showa era of Godzilla films (Organic kaiju would bleed when injured and mecha would ""bleed"" oil/coolant and let loose showers of sparks). This would probably result in the game receiving a T rating, which I think is fitting. Similar to the rage mechanic from Godzilla: Save the Earth and critical mass from Godzilla Unleashed, there would be a mechanic where a kaiju could become even more powerful and have a one-time special attack that would relinquish their ""rage meter"". As for how the quota for this event to happen to your kaiju would be met, that would have to be left up to the designers of the game. It could through an item like in the two previously mentioned games, but I personally like an implementation as both a comeback mechanic and as a reward for comboing an opponent without being hit. This ""rage attack"" would be unique for every kaiju, which would lead to some very interesting team dynamics.\n\nThe game would benefit greatly from an online mode where you can go with friends or randoms and fight 1v1's team battles, etc. This was one aspect of the original Atari games that bothered me, the lack of any sort of online capability.\n\nJust like Godzilla Unleashed this game's kaiju (I'd prefer they be called Titans to coincide with the MonsterVerse, and I'll call them that for now on) would be split into factions. I think the four factions from Godzilla Unleashed were perfect, so I'll stick with them.\n\nWhile I'd love to describe all of the Titans I think would fit the game, I'm just gonna leave it as a clip note on one of the four factions; The *Earth Defenders*. It should be noted that I'm not even mentioning all of them below, it's just a rundown to give you an idea of what I'm getting at. At the very bottom of the post, there's a roster that would be the most fitting imo.\n\n# Earth Defenders: This faction is comprised of Titans that seek to defend planet Earth at all costs, and will fight tooth and nail doing so.\n\n* Godzilla (As mentioned at the beginning he'd use his MonsterVerse design here. His ""rage attack"" would be him temporarily becoming his burning form from Godzilla: KotM. While in this form he would become even more powerful than the extra strength rage mode provides, and he would have a powerful atomic pulse attack)\n* Mothra (She'd be using her [MonsterVerse](https://godzilla.fandom.com/wiki/Mothra_(MonsterVerse)) design this time around. Her rage attack wouldn't be an attack at all, but a levelwide effect that would stun all enemies, and heal Mothra and her allies. Just like the Atari games, she'd start in her larva form and would be capable of transforming into her imago form at will)\n* Rodan (He'd be using his [MonsterVerse](https://godzilla.fandom.com/wiki/Rodan_(MonsterVerse)) design. Although not canon to his appearance in Godzilla: KotM, I'd let him retain his uranium heat beam from Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla II. For his rage attack, I'd have him fly high above the stage and cause a series of volcanic eruptions around the stage)\n* Kong (Of course he'd use his [MonsterVerse](https://godzilla.fandom.com/wiki/King_Kong_(MonsterVerse)) semi-bipedal design. Kong would be the most tactical and resourceful Titan in the likes of the Earth Defenders, if not the entirety of the game. He'd of course have his axe with him for edged attacks and it could be thrown as a potent ranged weapon although he'd have to go retrieve it. Other Titans could pick his axe up and throw it, but they couldn't use it to the same extent as Kong does. Without his axe Kong would resort to various blunt attacks with his powerful arms. Blocking attacks with the axe would obviously be better than blocking attacks with Kong's arms. Kong would be the only Titan capable of climbing especially large buildings and using them as a vantage point to attack from. For his rage attack I'd make it a flashy overhead axe throw that would slam and stick into a single foes chest. Kong would then have a small window of time to run up to the impaled Titan and brutally slam them around by lifting and chopping the ground with the axe while the foe is still attached mind you)\n* Anguirus (The first character where things get tricky. For characters who don't exist within the MonsterVerse their design should either be the same as their original one, or be drastically updated to fit in better. I personally prefer the latter, since seeing a derpy Showa Mechagodzilla 1 fight alongside the much cooler looking Godzilla vs. Kong design of Mechagodzilla would just be odd, to say the least. Okay, back on track. Anguirus would be the best defensive character in the game due to the spiky nature of his back which would injure any Titan unfortunate enough to strike it as well as poison them. He'd lack any sort of beam weapon but he would have a sonic roar that would cause damage in a radius around him. His signature ability would be curling up into a spiky ball of pain and rapidly rolling around which would do relatively high damage to Titans that don't block it and break the defense of Titans that do. A new ability he'd have is the ability to burrow similar to fellow Earth Defender Baragon, although not as well. His rage attack is pretty much entirely made up, but it would be based on his Godzilla: Destroy All Monsters Melee rage attack. It would involve Anguirus jumping into the air firing his spikes off in all directions as he spins about. Instead of the spikes turning into undefined energy though, the spikes would remain the same as they normally are and would poison any Titan they hit. He'd regenerate new spikes almost immediately)\n* King Caesar (King Caesar's redesign should look like his Godzilla: Final Wars design but modified to look more like a real creature and less like a suit. He'd have two stances: A defensive one and an offensive one. Depending on his stance, his fighting style would change to reflect it, with the defensive using weaker yet safer attacks, while his offensive stance uses more unruly powerful strikes. To signify the stance change, his ears would change position as well since they'd be floppy in his defensive stance and erect in his offensive stance. The final thing I have to say about King Caesar is that he shouldn't have his solar beam weapon from Unleashed, but should automatically absorb any energy weapon fired at him in one eye and fire it back out through the other)\n\nNow that you've got an idea of how the game would feel/play here's my personal dream roster:\n\n# Earth Defenders\n\n* Godzilla\n* Mothra (Larva and Imago)\n* Rodan\n* Kong\n* Anguirus\n* Gamera (Why not, we'd love to see it)\n* Mothra Leo (Larva and Imago)\n* Baragon\n* King Caesar\n* Zilla (Based on his Animated Series version in personality which is benevolent and has green atomic breath)\n* Gorosaurus\n* Kumonga (Maybe an individual [Mother Longlegs](https://godzilla.fandom.com/wiki/Mother_Longlegs) that is larger than usual?)\n* Ebirah \n* Varan\n* Minilla (A Titan in need of a **serious** design change. I'd like to see him have a much cooler design akin to the MonsterVerse Godzilla and the Heisei Godzilla Junior rather than the Pillsbury Doughboy seen in Son of Godzilla and Godzilla: Final Wars)\n* Manda\n* Biollante (She contains the soul of Erika Shiragami and never harms an innocent person in her debut movie, so why is she always an antagonist in all other Godzilla media? She'd start in her Rose form and be able to transform into her Final form)\n* Kamacuras\n* Titanosaurus (He was a mind-controlled benevolent creature in Terror of Mechagodzilla, idk why he was a Mutant in Godzilla Unleashed...)\n* Maguma (Reptilian walrus-looking boyo)\n* Balkzardan (An obscure kaiju exclusive to Godzilla Trading Battle. This kaiju could be the inspiration for Raiju in the games continuity)\n\n# Global Defense Force\n\n* Ultraman (Earth may need him now in its time of need haha)\n* Zone Fighter (Same situation as Ultraman, they'd both be really cool crossover characters)\n* M.O.G.U.E.R.A.\n* Mechagodzilla 2\n* Kiryu\n* Jet Jaguar (In order to make him fit in better with the MonsterVerse continuity, I'd make him a collection of nanobots, which would account for his ability to grow and shrink)\n* Mecha-King Ghidorah\n* Mechani-Kong (Perhaps this mecha was repurposed by the GDF after his damaged ""corpse"" was confiscated. He definitely needs a design update, since his [original design](https://godzilla.fandom.com/wiki/Mechani-Kong) looks like a man in plate armor with a metallic gorilla head lol. I'd change his lore to be a metal framework built around the skeleton of a member of Kong's species. Think of him as Kong's Kiryu)\n\n# Mutants\n\n* Shin Godzilla/Kamakura-san (An obscenely powerful mutated marine creature that resembles Godzilla's species, but otherwise bears no relation. Bonus points if his theme is [Persecution of the Masses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STE_ugj7s2M))\n* Destoroyah (Starts in its Aggregate form and can fly around by quickly transforming into its Flying form. Just like Mothra, Battra, and Biollante, it could transform, becoming its powerful Final form)\n* Spacegodzilla\n* Mechagodzilla 0 (The Mechagodzilla seen in Godzilla vs. Kong that has gone rogue from Apex Cybernetics original plan. It is now under the control of a member of King Ghidorah's species)\n* MUTO (The player can choose between the male MUTO and the female MUTO on the character select. While the male is the faster of the two, he is also the more fragile. The female is much slower while also being much tankier)\n* Skull Devil\n* Battra (Both Larva and Imago)\n* Megaguirus\n* Dagahra\n* Obsidius\n* Krystalak\n* Jyarumu (Another obscure kaiju from Godzilla Trading Battle)\n* GP-547 Razin (Yet another obscure kaiju from Godzilla Trading Battle. He's a fairly cool and unique concept if I'm being honest)\n* Vagnosaurus (Yet tey another GTB kaiju)\n\n# Aliens\n\n* King Ghidorah\n* Mechagodzilla 1 (He'd start as Fake Godzilla, and look identical to the MonsterVerse Godzilla, but at the behest of the player or the AI, would shed the facade and reveal his true form)\n* Gigan (Before the start of a game you can select whether Gigan has his iconic hook hands, or the badass chainsaw hands from GFW. The hooks would result in faster attacks while the chainsaws result in stronger attacks)\n* Hedorah (It can fly around by transforming into its Flying form momentarily)\n* Monster X/Keizer Ghidorah (He would start as Monster X but could transform into Keizer Ghidorah at will)\n* Megalon\n* Orga\n* Gezora\n* Ganimes\n* Kamoebas\n* Desghidorah\n* Moguera\n* Dogora\n* Barugaron (Aaaaaaannnnddd another obscure GTB kaiju)\n* Shiigan (GTB kaiju go brrrrr)"
mlsxcu,"A memory game, but not","What if you made a cat and mouse style horror game where you have to complete different objectives.. The game takes place in a building that the main character vaguely remembers.. There is a map of your location and all of the different rooms and hallways in the building. But sometimes a room on the map changes locations when you reach it and the main character plays a voice line like ""oh wait, I thought there was a room here"" or ""oh, my memory of this place must be a bit off"" and every time you fail the rooms are where you know they are instead of where the main character (and the map) thinks they are\n\n(sorry for the difficulty to read lol I just wanted to put it out there)"
mlojga,Simple Ideas?,"I recently got into gamedev and I would love some good simple game ideas, preferably something like a hyper casual mobile game."
mlmqa8,Which FPS features would you remove,"I have been testing out alot of FPS games for a year now I found alot of things that I either hate or want to do differently. Please place your thoughts in the comments along with a reasonable explanation for your thoughts, Thanks.\n- No snipers(or sniper scopes)\n- No killcam\n- No kill Feed\n- Minimap placement"
mlm75p,Need an opinion on existing idea - sort of puzzle game,"Hey there, I've posted this on a different sub-reddit but got no replies 😞 . So I've decided to give it another try before ditching the idea completely. \n\nThe game (working title is “The Fire”) is some sort of puzzle on maps built on hexes; core mechanics in a nutshell:\n\n* You control the Fire and on every map there is a target(s) to destroy\n* Both Fire and Target have HP, in order to destroy the target Fire HP should be higher (obviously)\n* Moving to a hex will increase or decrease Fire HP (depending on type)\n* Big levels - not sure *how* big, but thinking of 40x40 to start with\n* Puzzle elements - for example, in the video in order to pass the magic gates the Fire should find’n’destory the wizard tent. I have more ideas\n* Narrative elements\n* Various collectibles\n\nTo be frank, I liked the idea on paper, but after implementing a demo not so sure anymore.\n\nYou can also find a short video in the [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/indiegames/comments/mkl6iw/the_fire_conceptdemo_genre_is_undefined_looking/)\n\nThanks for your honest feedback!"
mlly7d,Zombie City game with some degree of takeover progress,"I love zombie games, but hate that when I leave an area I've cleared and come back, it's filled with zombies again. So how about this: a zombie City game with an element of a takeover type mechanic. You start off in like a hospital or something, boarded up windows etc, and have to clear out the immediate street of zombies, which then gives you access to the houses and buildings in that street for materials to build a barrier you place at the end of the street to keep it as ""taken over"". If you don't build the barrier fast enough, the zombies flood back in. The houses which you've now ""unlocked"" have trapped people you've now rescued to add to your party, as well as resources like food, water, medical supplies, ammo. Then you work your way through the next street and so on and so forth. The final objective could maybe to be to either clear the whole city, or carve a safe path to an exit out of the city, or maybe to save a loved one on the other side of the city.  Each area you unlock could have characters with their own objectives, stories etc, as well as access to better gear (weapons and ammo at the police station, food at the supermarket, etc). Also, just 1 type of zombies: runners. 28 days layer style. No super zombies that are muscly and tough, no fat zombies that puke on you, just hundreds and hundreds of runner zombies that shriek as they run and alert other zombies to follow. You trip 1 off, the whole horde is sprinting at you. Also, they can attack barriers which have a limited time/health before they break and the zombies flood back in and you basically lose that street. Your rescued party members will defend, but if the barrier breaks, they'll fall back and some might die. If you've decided to use the materials from the previous barrier to build the new front line barrier and it breaks, you will lose that street too or as many streets as are left without barriers so material management is required. With all those running zombies that can swarm you in an instant, it becomes clear how little time you actually have to clear an area and get a barrier up before you're overrun and pushed back again. I'd like to imagine a worthwhile strategy would be to get the barrier up at the end of the street as your party members cover you to create a ""kill zone"", and then clear out all the stragglers within it. Materials used for barriers can include classic things like wood planks and corrugated metal sheeting, but also include skips (heavy and slow to move), cars, portions of metal fences, and other things to reinforce it and make it stronger. All materials you and your party have to physically carry or move around instead of just some green silhouette and a ""place here"" button. Ammo is scarce and basic until you get to the police station (or military base?) So you'll have to rely on melee weapons alot too (think Dead Rising where everything is pretty much a weapon). All of this, I imagine as an FPS style, so like zombie games like Left 4 Dead, Dead Island, Dying Light, those kind of things. Rival hostile humans could be a thing, or friendly groups to link up with, or maybe several groups with their own politics where if you help group A, group B turns hostile cos they hate group A or something maybe different groups have different advantages. Some are military or police, some are gangsters, some are useless. I dunno. Maybe have the individual people you rescue have different skills too that help if you assign them to the correct role, some build faster, carry more materials, scavenge more stuff, can attack really well but can't defend as well or vice versa, have medical skills, use less food when theyre cooking meals for everyone, farming skills, move faster, better firearm handling or use melee better...\n\nThink I've rambled a heck load there. But this idea I've sat on for years and it all just kinda spilled out, so I apologise if i seem to jump from one idea to the next and back like a hyperactive kid whose go into thebsugar bag.  there's bits I've forgot, so if things don't seem fully thought through.. they once were.. Let me know thoughts and ideas on this."
mlh73d,Game idea from a dream i had today,"So today I had a dream which I wanted to share. So in this dream, the game was like a civilization game except for it was  **3 d** and in **space** where you would choose a race of any kind like for example vampires or elves or strangely a race called radiant's                                                                                                                       \nand each race would have special defensive and offensive skills like for example tough skin making certain creatures do half damage against you or like for vampires an ability that costs a lot of stamina but increases damage by half and that half of damage will actually come back to you as health or the radiant's ability which doubles your damage at the cost of stamina which also does triple damage if done against vampires but will cost even more stamina if done against them                                       \n\neach race would get three skills one offensive one defensive and one of your choice and that ability of your choice could be like for example better swim speed, better strength, having 30% more stamina and so on but you could also choose to have any other ability which is not unique to a race and you could also choose a skill you already have to make them better like for example super tough skin making some creatures just simply do no damage to you and others mostly half or normal damage.\n\nyou would also choose to be a hero or a villain of which villains would have more aggressive weapons while the heroes would have more peaceful weapons\n\nand after all that you finally start playing, you spawn in a solar system in a starter ship and there would be 20 procedurally generated solar systems of which ten of them would also have players or ai npc's.\n\n On every solar system, there would always be one civilized planet and 2 which have animals, the count of all planets in a solar system would be 10, the civilized planets could be either tribal, civilized, and modern with the tribal one being the most common.\n\n now you are finally ready to go to a planet but you also may be wondering but what if I don't want to settle on a planet then you will lose fuel and electricity until you don't have either and suffocate to death, but if you finally decide on a planet then you will settle on it if the planet you chose had above tribal people then you will have a 50% chance for them to let you on their village if you are a villain that will be 40% if a hero 60% and also depending on your race then you will have either a lower or higher chance and it will also depend on their race as well as most times you will be a different race so if they are of a race that does not like your's then its a minus on their chance to let you in their village but if it's a positive a higher one especially if you are of the same race \n\nwhat if they don't let you on their village then you won't be able to settle there peacefully and will have to do it with force but if you are a hero you can try again peacefully but if that also fails then you won't be able to settle there any more\n\nbut what if it succeeds then you will ''join'' their village and will be able to harvest the planet for its natural resources to gain better technology but never technology like a wooden cart and more advanced like a steel axe and then after that is technology like cars, submarines if the planet has an ocean, planes, jets until you are able to transform the villagers into your own species and another thing you could share your technology with the villagers increasing their loyalty towards you and your firepower because now you would be able to put the villagers to work for you like for doing cars, cutting down trees, flying ships you get the point. you have the ability to upgrade your vehicles to have **your** special skills like tough skin for example and with those skills that used stamina now they use fuel or electricity. now you have finally been able to build a rocket ship to escape the planet what do you do well there are multiple you could build cities on habitable planets, build mining sites on asteroids, even build giant lasers capable of destroying planets   or you could do the actual objective which is to destroy the other ai's and player's or to take their cities and planets and that's pretty much it, you can comment on it if you like some ideas and I will be sure to read them"
mlg4vx,Survival Horror RPG gameplay concept,"I got a random idea\n\nWhat if we make a Survival Horror-RPG system that takes the Rock Paper Scissors mechanics of fate extra, the customization and magic moves from Parasite Eve, the Buffs and debuffs from Genshin Impact, the movement from panzer dragoon Saga, and the Shooting from D2?\n\nSounds complicated, but hear me out\n\nFirst off, we have the shooting mechanics from D2. Fairly simple, you are given several gun types, but you can also include special types of ammo and meelee weapons. The combat would also have an interface similar to that of lightgun shooters like house of the dead, but you'd also have to deal with random encounters while walking around (but take out the tank controls since thats unnessecary). You'd also have to be aware of weak points and reload at the right times in order to not expose yourself to attacks.\n\nThe weapons can also be customized like in parasite eve, and they can be given addons that increase certain stats or provide buffs under certain conditions like in genshin impact, such as buffing your characters attack 15% upon successfuly hitting a weak point. The enemies would actually drop loot this time instead of the ammo and healing items being exclusively found in the world like in D2.\n\nAlso like parasite eve, you can pull off certain moves using magic, but you'd have to wait for a gauge to charge. Like in Panzer Dragoon saga, there would be 3 gauges that charge as the fights go on, and to pull off this special move you'd need to use magic and some of your gauge. Unlike D2, leveling up not only increases your HP, but all your other stats as well. You don't need to wait for your gauge to charge to use itmes however\n\nAs for the rock paper scissors mechanics of fate extra, you'd have 3 options for attack styles. Offensive, Defensive, and Break. Offensive would solely focus on dealing damage to the opponent. When the opponent tries to attack you, you can switch to defense. You can hold your weapon sideways in front of you and move/rotate it around to block the oncoming attacks, and successful blocks would let you counter the enemy if you make a button press after a successful block\n\nIf the enemy takes a defensive position, you can use break mode to curcuimvent their defennse, but you'd also have to be careful to avoid counters.\n\nAs for the movement mechanics, thats where the Panzer Dragoon saga style gameplay comes in. You can take 1 of 4 positions around the enemy and  rotate your camera in order to dodge attacks or get in a advantageous position in order to aim at weak points.\n\nAll of that is probably confusing, but you can get a general picture if you study my idea hard enough. In general, Fate Extra, D2, and Panzer Dragoon saga had fun combat, but had elements lacking which made the challenge overwhelming. Most of these RPGs are obscure though. So it might be cool to take all of their best elements and make them into a fluid system. Unfortunately I don't have the skills to make a game like this."
mldycc,Customizable 4v4 MOBA,"The idea: A 4v4, 2 lane MOBA where you can make your own customizable hero to play as. You will be able to choose the body type, race, gender, and the outfit of your character. Your character will have 3 ability slots and a passive slot that can be filled with spells from the 4 main categories in each element. The categories being defense, damage, mobility, and support, with 4 spells in each category. Basically meaning that there are 4 defense spells, 4 damage spells, 4 mobility spells, and 4 support spells for each element. As well as 4 defense passives, 4 damage passives, 4 mobility passives, and 4 support passives for every element. Elements are stone, lighting, fire, water, and nature. I also don't think that you should be restricted to using  only spells from a chosen element, and you should be able to mix and match mid you wanted. This is just something extra but you could also make it where the abilities realistically interact with each other, like how in spell break you can blast the boulder with wind to make it fly faster. \n\nProblems: because every time you hop into a match your opponents would be completely unique, it would be very difficult to keep track of what each character in a match does, especially without any visual cues. Due to it being a MOBA and the way the camera is, it makes actually viewing your custom made character difficult. Because you can choose all your abilities there will be times where certain combinations will be absolutely broken, and some will be super weak, making balance kind of difficult.\n\nSolutions: to make it easier to keep track of what someone's character does, in the loading screen you will be able to see your opponents and your allies abilities, the abilities will have to have recognisable icons and just above the icons it should tell you what category the spell comes from and how it works. For example, let's say someone had the flamethrower spell, it would tell you it's a damage ability, and that it deals damage in a line AOE. You could also check the leader board while the match is in progress if you need a reminder, clicking on any heroes profile to see all their spells with their full descriptions. Now for the problem with the camera and customization, the races will all have very large and distinct characteristics that sperates them from the others, like elves having really large ears; also no helmets. You could also add a camera mode that lets you get close to your character to see them, almost like a cinematic camera angle. For the balance problem... I really don't know, I guess you just wait till someone discovers something broken and then nerf it a little."
mlddzw,Move to replace the midair spin in 3D platformers,"The concept of a “spin” is extremely overused in 3D platformers. Mario, Yooka-laylee, The spongebob 3d platformers, and a lot of other games have the spin in one way or another. Are there any other traversal options that are similar to the spin, but not exactly? I mean, I know why it is so overused, it is a versatile movement option, able to help with both platforming and combat, but it is so overused. \n\nOr are there ways to “revolutionize” the spin, or make it more interesting? Like how throwing Cappy in Mario odyssey also did a spin move, and helped re-orient the player in midair. \n\nI’m asking this question because I am developing a moveset for a 3d platformer and want your opinion on this topic.\n\nIt should be able to be performed in midair."
mlcwh4,FPS Idea,What would you think about an FPS adventure game similar (but not the same) to the 2015 movie Chappie
mlb37e,The Chris Hansen Experience,"So April Fools have come and gone and I thought up of a game idea revolving around Chris Hansen and the To Catch a Predator show. Obviously this would be a joke game/parody and would have to be non commercial due to copyright. The easiest way to make this would be to make it a visual novel but I was thinking it would be better if it was in 3D fps and you actually get to move and control your character. The game will also use actual voice clips of Chris Hansen and the decoy from the show (although I guess you could also get someone else to voice act the decoy).\n\nSo the game starts off with the player standing in front of a house and a girl's voice (the decoy) calls out to you from within asking you to come in. So you enter the house and the girl's voice says she'll come down in a minute and to have a cookie that she made on the table. The player can choose to eat the cookie or just wait around (it doesn't matter except maybe slightly changes some dialogue) and the player will be given some dialogue choices (small chit chat like ""nice place you got here"" or ""this cookie is really good"" if the player ate the cookie etc.). \n\nThen Chris Hansen will walk out from the back to greet you and ask you to have a seat (gesturing to the chair). The player can choose to leave which will end the game prematurely or pressing the prompt to sit on the chair. Then Chris will start asking the usual questions like ""What are you doing here?"" and the player could choose ""Lie: I was lost (or some other poor excuse)"" or ""Truth: I'm here to meet a friend"". Let's say the player chose truth then Chris will ask ""and how old is this friend?"" and the player will once again have to choose ""Truth: She's 13"" or ""Lie: She said she was 18"". If the player chooses lie Chris will pull out the chat logs and say ""well that's not what it says here in this chat log."" Then Chris will read the logs ""How old are you? I'm 13. Damn that's young, I could get in trouble for this."" then he turns to you and asks ""What is a grown man doing here meeting up with a 13 year old girl?"" and from here the game will continue with the player fumbling through excuses along with Chris questioning them and reading the chat logs like ""I want to blank your blank.""\n\nThe dialogue will branch out and vary depending on the player's choices but it doesn't really matter as it will always end the same way with Chris Hansen saying his iconic phrase ""Well there's something you should know, and that is I'm Chris Hansen from Dateline NBC and we're doing a story about computer predators who try to meet up with underaged teens (at this point the camera crew will come out). And if there's anything else you want to say now would be the time to say it otherwise you're free to walk out the same way you came in."" The player will then be given a few dialogue choices like thanking Chris Hansen or apologizing or still trying to come up with an excuse or they can stay silent and the only thing left to do now is to walk out the way you came in where police will come out from the corner shouting at you to get down and arrest you which then ends the game.\n\nEaster egg: Camouflage guy will be an easter egg where if the player somehow manages to evade the cops and make a run for it he will suddenly jump out from behind a bush and arrest the player (it could even be a jumpscare). He could also appear if the player tries to leave before entering the house (essentially if the player tries to leave the boundary of the game camouflage guy will immediately jump out of nowhere and arrest the player)."
mlb0jg,"A Stealth game where you have a bunch of very powerful gadgets, but if you get caught using them the enemy will start deploying countermeasures.","[](/adventureflutters)Some examples of the concept:\n\n* You have a temporary cloaking device to avoid being seen, but if you bump into an enemy guard or if they see you fade in / out then guards with thermal vision will start showing up.\n* You have a grappling hook, but if you're seen with it then a lot of high up places you'd normally use it for will be boarded up.\n* You have an electric mine that knocks out enemies that step on it. If a second enemy witnesses it then they'll deploy countermeasures like insulated shoes or detection drones.\n* A hacking device to get through locked doors with a password. Once found out security will switch and you'll have to start getting keycards off enemies to get through them instead, or maybe it will take much longer to hack more secure passwords.\n* You could also have things like EMP grenades or knockout gas that the enemy will know about as soon as you use it and will slowly start ramping up defenses against the more you use them instead of instantly deploying the answer.\n\nSo this will come with a couple of big design challenges.\n\nFirst, you want to make sure that a tool is *less* useful, not just outright disabled after the enemy starts playing around it.\n\nSecond, there needs to be some incentive to keep playing once you get found out instead of just restarting to keep your favorite toy, or maybe you're in situations where you need to use a tool to get away and reveal it that way. Maybe the ending changes depending on how many restarts you do, or maybe it auto-saves when you're discovered. In either case, maybe the answer is that it should be a shorter game with an emphasis on replayability and game mastery."
mla8i2,An action-survival horror game where you build and design a giant vehicle to survive from monsters,"Hi! This idea is for a open world post-apocalyptic survival-game which revolves around building your own protected vehicle, from scraps, in order to survive the monsters/zombies in the world. \n\nThe game:\n\nBasic engineering comes into play and the goal is to keep improving your vehicle, make it bigger, more powerful, better designed, so that you can survive in ever more dangerous environments. The upper size limit might be like the Clone Turbo Tank from Star Wars. The vehicle needs fuel and maintenance, and it can break down.\n\nThe world:\n\nA post-apocalyptic futuristic world, with varying landscapes and large, abandoned cities. The monsters have different abilities and behaviors: some are fast and move in packs, others are slow giants moving alone. Some of the terrain is difficult to drive in. You can survive on foot but must be extraordinarily careful. The world is exciting to explore but difficult to travel in."
ml9dw2,Cool mechanics that could be implemented in a 3D platformer,"Do any of you have some cool mechanics for 3d collect a thon platformers that are as versatile as cappy from mario odyssey(has to be completely original) somthing that can be chained with the movement. Something that allows players to move around skillfully using a mechanic. Look at this video if u want to know what im talking about: https://youtu.be/z_KVEjhT4wQ. I already have an idea in mind, something similar to the copy ability from Kirby, but I dont know how it would be executed. Example: in odyssey, the capture mechanic is the ""core"" mechanic, and cappy is the way it is executed. That is what I am requesting. A cool way to execute a mechanic. I really want players to utilize the move set of this hypothetical game, so use this video if you want to know what I’m talking about. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=rlmVxrq-3Go. ONE MORE THING, it has to be a ranged attack, but not too far from the player, because jumping on an enemy is hard."
ml7rfy,The exorcist a game about you trying to save possessed people,"Hello, I've had this game idea for a while now. In the game you play as a exorcist who's job it is to cleanse possessed people. My idea is that every possessed person is possessed by a demon who are categorised in different difficulty levels. Each difficulty level is slightly harder then the last one. Before you begin cleansing people you first get a mail about the possessed person and the amount of information that you get about that person depends on what kind of demon/difficulty level you get. After the mail you can buy stuff in a shop that can help cleanse this demon and every demon/difficulty level need different items then other demons. After that you start the process of cleansing the possessed person. I haven't really thought out yet what I want the game mechanics to look like or what they should do. But when your successful in cleansing the possessed person you get a amount of money depending on what demon/difficulty level the possessed person is. This is the basic idea of the game. Please give me feedback so I can improve the idea or switch too something completely different."

ml5477,Interesting post apocalyptic survival game idea?,"I know the post apocalyptic Genre of games may be over done at this point but this one might actually sell pretty well:\n\n\n\nThe game takes place in the 1940's during world war 2 although in this timeline the war has come to a halt.\n\n\n Several months After the Pearl Harbor attack on December 7th and the snows still haven't melted and have simply become too deep and too cold for the war to continue\n\n\nThe player character, (a former soldier who's rank and former war faction [Nazi Germany, America, Japan, etc.] Can all be changed in character creation)\nComes to find out through the game's storytelling that this is actually Fimbulwinter, the three year winter from Norse mythology that signals the coming of Ragnarok.\n\n\nNot only does the player have to survive the frozen wastelands of 1940's America but also find and kill certain bosses like Fenris wolf and Jormungandr the world serpent in order to prevent Ragnarok from happening all while contending with traditional survival game aspects such as hunger and cold."

mkl684,Horror movie game,"Ive been thinking on this since ""Friday the 13th the game"" came out and yes I understand it would be hard to get owners of certain horror movies to give permission and all that other stuff that goes on like that. But please read and give me feed back on what you think of this idea. Sorry in advance to grammar Nazis my grammar is horrible and will probably make it impossible to read for some people.\n\nIt's a game set with the same idea as the ""friday the 13th the game"" but it's got multiple different horror movies to choose from all with different gameplay and different maps as how the movies went and the gameplay would be adjusted depending on what map (which would be the different locations from the movies). The characters and villian you play as would vary from the different map you play on, such as playing the ""texas chain saw massacre"" mode  leather face and the survivors would have different attair depending on the map you play on.\n\nif you haven't played the ""friday the 13th game"" it's basically a multiplayer survival game where 1 person plays as jason and the other players play as campers, the campers have to escape the camp or kill jason to win the game. While jason has to kill the other plays to win the game. \n\nThis game would have different game modes for different horror movies such as the ""halloween"" game mode, you would have 1 person playing as micheal myers and the others playing as Laurie, officer Hawkins, Loomis or whoever was prevalent in the movie. The player using micheal would have to murder the other players while the other players would work together trying to contain micheal and put him back in the asylum \n\nThis concept could work with a range of different horror movies, even some horror movies that aren't  slashers such as the ""conjuring"". 1 player would play as the entity and the others would play as the family, priest,  ed and Lorraine. As the entity you can possess one of the other players and play as them slowly killing off the other players. But They can perform an exorcism on you, which results in the player playing the entity loosing the game.\n\nAs you could imagine this works with plenty of different horror movies. \n\nJust imagine this game with beautiful graphics, brutal kills, horror movie nostalgia and just being able to play a horror game of your favourite horror movie.\n\n I realise this is just a dream of mine to have a game like this as I am a horror movie junkie. \n\nThank you for reading."

mkb2b3,Has somebody a good idea for imortality in boss fights?,"Sorry for my bad English up front,\n\nSo I'm making a game that is corantly in pre alpha with my team and we are kinda stuck with the idea to have a imortal main character (and yes I know it is stupid but wait).\n\nSo our idea was you are imortal, but you can get tortured, captured or simply left with you wounds on the ground instead of dying and you have the risk of losing your limps in a fight and need a prostatic or to seek a magican that can bring back your lost flash. \n\nKnow, what I wanted to ask you my dear reader is, how do I do Consequences in boss fights, because you can't die and why would a boss leave you on the ground or capture you or only cut of you limps when he would be granting you a second chance of killing him, by a simple enemy it is believable or tolerable that he leaves you be or captures you, because he is there to slow you down of your mission to protect another, but by a boss this does not work and that is what I want from you, could you please help me with a consequence for Boss fights and if you are, it would also be helpful when you Criticize this idea and yes I know it was never done in this way, but that's why I think it is a good idea and I will also help with questions if there are any left to be honest with you. \n\nAnd before I forget it, the theme of the game is about loss and revange as a imortal being and is set in a fantasy version of Madevil Japan.\n\nOur game has also a day system, where you only have a limited amount of time to complete a quest and you also have a limited amount of time to begin them, if the time is up the quest can not be completed or started, a example for such a quest would be, the daughter of a farmer is taken and you need to find her in three days or she will be lost for ever, what would give Replayability, because some quests play at the same time, also if you get captured or wounded by a enemy you lose time to complete your quest. \n\nThanks for every one how even read trow this, even if you can't help me the act of trying to help is what matters."

I have heard a lot about people grinding out the outriders demo like crazy and I personally I played the Division beta more than I would have thought. \n\nIt seems like that concept could be drawn out to get more engagement. Each month the developers could release a new area, a couple of quests, a couple of new items/weapons and raise the level cap. \n\nIt would cause people to go through shorter cycles of leveling and end game gear grinding which I think people would enjoy more."

And i think not just batman as an enemy but also a evil/mindcontrolled superman, or even the villains\n\nas per the gameplay, you play as a criminal, policeman, or a citizen trying to escape the heroes or villains. I kind of thought that it would have the same concept as FNAF Joy of Creation, also may i add the choice to pick what scenario the player would want. You could pick the stage, the enemy you want to escape from, what is your role (criminal, police officer, citizen), and how hard you would want the game to be\n\nhonestly i just want someone to make this game so i could play it lol\n\n(my punctuation and english is bad but surely you'll be able to understand it... i think)"

mjzfea,Ultra Run And Jump Mania (Update),"You may remember that I made a post here going through what I think could happen in a mobile game made by glitch productions. \n———————————————————————————\n(https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/mip88l/ultra_run_and_jump_mania/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf)\n————————————————————————————\nWell this post will go through the update, events, and the two things that I didn’t include in my last post.\n\nCode Collecting: (this was left out of my last post so I though of describing it here) basically code happens to be a way to move on in the story because after the boss number 2 you suddenly can’t access the next 10 levels in the area. Basically you need bits of code from tascorp’s server scattered in the endless mode and the story levels, but another way to get them is through boss runs, (I’ll explain them in a bit) once you gathered enough code 5 more levels will open, so you can say that you are gonna have to do some grinding if you wanna see the end. Speaking of which.\n\n120 more levels: these levels takes place a couple of months after you saved your friends by joining tascorp. And after playing through 2 levels lucks gives off a disappointed look stating that you’ve been playing the app only and that variety has to happen. Of course after you do boss number 13 Belle decides to help out by handing you an invincibility power up.\n\nBelle - Rage mode- makes you invincible for a short amount of time.\n\nThe next 120 levels have games from season 2 with levels 121 to 150 being Turbo Crash 9, levels 151 to 180 being Pocket Gakusei, levels 181 to 210 being Hidden Heroes, and Levels 211 to 240 being the glitched version of ultra jump mania.\n\nI can’t reveal what boss number 24 is, but let’s just say it’s someone we know.\n\nEvents: now these events may happen at a certain time and ends on a certain date, but it gives you the chance to unlock more costumes for Theo like Vacation Theo, aureo (a mix of Auri and Theo), shadow Theo, elder Theo, melon Theo, and many more.\n\nBoss run mode: now this is what you probably wanted to know about and how it’ll work. Well after you beat a certain number of bosses, Marco comes in and adds a mod where you can take on the bosses, but also have to complete a challenge. For example I choose to go against boss 3 which is the king crab with tas-boss enhancements, but I have to either not get hit by any of his attacks, or I have to hit him with a certain amount of coconuts. And yes there will be no power ups in this mode, meaning that you need to have the skills to take down the boss and the challenge along with it. Doing so will award you with some Tas-code which is a way to unlock 5 more levels. You can even change the difficulty of the challenge so you can earn more Tas-code in order to progress in the story levels.\n\nWell that’s basically everything you need to know about a game idea that I hope Glitch makes a reality, Ultra Run And Jump Mania. \n\nIf you want to know about the costumes for Theo, I’m afraid that I’m gonna spill the beans on them over at r/MetaRunner in 2 days, because this is r/gameideas not r/charactercostumeideas.\n\nNow that that’s settled, I’m gonna lie down. I talked too much.\n\n*lies down*"

mjx3sz,Open world dragon riding story game,"So I was playing some Red Dead the other day and thought about another game I played an open beta of (Century: Age of Ashes) and I was wondering why there aren't many more dragon games - with or without story, I absolutely love these mythical creatures and story based games of course. If there was a story game with a huuuge open world and good graphics where your main mission was to connect with a dragon you aquire and go on a journey, I would absolutely make that my favorite game. Something like Eragon maybe similar to Red Dead/Red Dead Online (with players and different dragon breeds/appearances would be great too), but being able to customize your dragon and character, walk around freely just by yourself too, get new equipment for both you and your dragon to protect yourselves, having to fight agains boss dragon rider NPCs (not every NPC is a dragon rider).\nDoesn't that sound great? I have been thinking about this for quite some time."
mjwbgm,Fighting/RPG Game.,"The main gameplay plays like most fighting games (Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat, etc). But the main RPG related twist comes in how the characters grow in strength like in RPGs. So for starters I would imagine there would be an option to create an entirely customisable character, including their default appearance, default stats, and class (each character would have at least 1 class which determines the moves they can use). As they win fights they gain experience and eventually level up, their stats increase and on occasion they learn the potential to use new moves. These moves can be interchanged with other moves in a characters moves (similar to how it worked in Mortal Kombat 11). Alongside the option to create a custom character you also have other characters that are part of the roster which also can be levelled up, etc. The last thing I want to add is equipment, all characters can equip armour and weapons (although some characters have limitations on what they can and can't equip). These pieces of equipment can affect certain stats, give moves unique properties, or even give access to moves only available when using a certain piece of equipment."
mjvdir,Survivor style game,"The tv show survivor was/is pretty popular and watching it recently I thought the same idea of two teams competing and the losing team having to vote one of their team members off could be fun. Having a sort of in-game tribal council where people can suggest who to vote off and allowing people to defend themselves and so on could be a lot of fun (similar to voting in among us).   \nLike in the show, if teams become too unbalanced they can be rebalanced by moving people around, and once the teams are too small for rebalancing it becomes a free for all for the solo win. I'm not sure what sort of mini-games would be played by the teams and solo, but I mainly thought of the idea of a tribal council and voting, so I guess this is more of a mechanic than a fully fledged game idea."
mjuya5,Island Mystery Style Game,"I've had this idea stirring around in my head for a while\n\nEssentially, you start off on a tropical island resort in the middle of the map(it's not procedurly generated) and everything seems normal, except there is something off about the people on the island. There are boats and the glider things that have a propeller on that you can fly, and go to the separate islands. The edge of the map is land with different several settlements. You keep hearing stories of the creatures that come out and if your not in a secure place, hell brakes loose(I don't know the reasons how they come out) I have an idea for the creatures and one is found on the outskirts off the map where if it can touch someone(npcs) it has a sticky substance that raps around the body and takes it over. You keep having flashbacks to the chaos that can break loose unless you solve solve mystery. Driving the boat to a local water village that lives on the starter island, they know something is wrong. And one of the islands have a large settlement where some of the tips are learned by the locals.\n\nI don't know if anyone would actually take this seriously but I thought it was an interesting idea. And tbh, this thing has been in several dreams with the world expanding each time.\n\ntld: tropical island mystery with something that is off by the locals and a creature that can create pure chaos."

The idea came from wanting to help out my local environmental governmental group's restoration of dry creekbeds to restore our vital watersheds via a set of [Natural Sequence Farming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylqR6u7xCjs) incentivization and direct action projects. Seeing how the presentation of the idea fell on deaf ears, I thought that visualizing the change via something like Unity would be a great way to make some long-lasting change as well as a way to give myself a single learning path for unity rather than random tutorials from unity giving me a general gist.   \n\n\n**THE IDEA**  \nI would like to make a simulator that shows the effect of different inputs on hydrating/dehydrating a landscape over time. The scope of environmental health as a whole is a bit too huge, so I'd like to just start with hydration and see how it goes. \n\nThe first step would be generating a terrain from importing a DEM (Digital Elevation Map), which we commonly use in GIS applications. Then running an ml image classification program on the terrain to detect bodies of water, hydraulic erosion, and flow direction if any (will be a challenge and time but very doable). After that, making inital inputs like an annual rainfall integer, flood/el nino year boolean, average temperatures for however many seasons exist, biome classification, etc. Ordering these can be a visually stimulating process that generates your ""canvas"" piece by piece.\n\nThen comes the player input. The sim starts in  the dry season. Yellow grass if any, a few trees, rocky creekbed, thats the kind of thing you're seeing at the moment. You're cued to press a play button that fast forwards the environment through a 12 month cycle. While it run's, you see a very fast forwarded version of water rising, flowing, and falling, along with the greening and yellowing that comes from a rising and falling water table. For the next cycle, you are free to actually make your placements. Place trees and reeds, noticing how much water they retain and slowly leech back into your water table during the drier seasons. Place rocks and small waterfalls, showing you that slowing the water flow on hillsides and creeks/rivers lowers erosion and helps water reach a wider area, for a longer period of time. Place some livestock and see the detrimental effects on one hand, but how many more you can effectively and responsibly support with these changes!\n\n**WRAP UP**  \nI really want to demonstrate how not much change on a watershed can make a huge difference. Right now if you told someone with a seasonal stream or pond on their property, that you could have that running year-round, or that you could even go fishing in their bone-dry ravine in just a few years, they understandably look at you like you're crazy. I think making a ""game"" like this can really help convince rural, suburban, and even urban people on  a visual level, that this is a great method to help move towards environmental sustainability in our communities. \n\nSo with that I'll get off of my soap box for a minute and ask what you think would be possible from this, if you think I can narrow it down to a prototype, and help me in my breaking it down into smaller chunks to create a learning path. Any small piece of advice would be helpful. Alternatively, PLEASE STEAL THIS IDEA IF YOU LIKE IT. I know it's rule 6 but I wanted to reiterate that if you have better knowledge and/or resources than me, please do! Just let me know so that  I can use it or help you on the environmental science side of whatever.\n\nAnyways thanks for letting me air that out! Not my dream game but I think it would be fun nonetheless."

mjkc4x,Third-person Roman warfare game,"Hello all,\n\nI had this idea for quite some time, being an enjoyer of Roman history and UE4 hobbist. It could be a career type game where you'd start as a new soldier, become a specialist, grow in ranks to be an Optio, Centurion, Equite and finally Legatus with each having a different gameplay in a large scale war. Of course, the gameplay would have to stand out and some sort of Total War strategy would have to be implemented.\n\nA landscape would be easy to make and the UE Marketplace has some Roman and Celtic models. Any other suggestions? Ideas?"

mjfu67,A Starcraft spy game set on Earth in modern times,"NOTE:  If you’re not familiar with the Starcraft games, then this idea may not mean much to you.  Blizzard Entertainment is free to use this idea. \n\nMy idea is set on Earth in modern times before the emergence of the United Powers League. It is a spy vs. spy game. One is a spy for the Protoss, and one is a spy for the Zerg, and both are human. This is a long open world game where both people live their lives, blend in with “normal” humans, gather and relay information, and ultimately hunt and kill their opponent (or be hunted and killed). \n\nThe Protoss spy:  You are deeply spiritual person with an interest in philosophy and religion.  As a newly-instated philosophy professor at a local college, you are well versed in many schools of thought, but you dream of one that allows humans to transcend and become truly wiser and better.  One day, you are abducted by the Protoss, whom refer to themselves as agents of the Conclave. They teach you their vision, philosophy, and way of life. At last, they modify your brain so that you have psionic abilities, and let you experience the Khala (a transcendent Nirvana-like union of minds).  You also learned about their mortal enemies: the Zerg.\n\nThe Zerg spy:  You are a social worker with the criminal justice system working with parolees. This work was chosen because you wanted to help people, but over time you have developed a hatred and disgust of humans. The greed, ignorance, irrationality, violence, egocentricism, and the primitiveness.  You want to change them, and visualize a human hive. One day, you are abducted by Zerg Overlord and taken up into space. From there, you are infested, and you commune with the Overmind. You are inducted into the Swarm, and learn of the Zerg’s grand mission to assimilate all life in the universe into the Swarm.  You also learn about their mortal enemies: the Protoss.\n\nGameplay:  As a long open world game, both spies will live out their lives while secretly serving alien powers. Both of them look human, although the Zerg spy has a slightly grayish skin tone and yellow eyes.  You can get married, have hobbies, go to work, attend PTA meetings, and appear normal. Behind the scenes, you are gathering top secret information, taking DNA samples of various organisms, going on covert missions, and occasionally getting into combat situations to meet your objectives. Naturally, the Zerg spy would be more willing to kill innocent people that the Protoss spy, who would behave more honorably. Throughout the game, you will be looking for clues to identify your opponent.  The two spies will always be hunting each other, so be careful not to leave clues that will make you trackable.\n\nAbilities:  Both spies have psionic powers. The Protoss spy has abilities similar to a Templar, and in battle has a psi blade and mind blast powers. The Zerg spy will heal over time, has claws that come out, and can launch swarms of insects to attack enemies.\n\nCommunication:  The Protoss spy psychically communicates with Executor Sondar, and the Zerg spy communicates with Cerebrate Grupis.  They receive missions through them, and relay information to them.\n\nVictory:  You win by killing the other spy, and by relaying critical information to your alien boss.\n\nFeel free to contribute to this idea. "
mjfeli,Fame System in a 2d rpg game,"Hello,\n\nI have a Fame system in the current rpg game im making. \n\nI added this system to the game to add some spice. Basically its a 2d rpg game in the vein of Darkest dungeon. And you build up your Fame depending on the choices you make throughout the game, lets say behaving good or bad. \n\nIf you build up your Fame towards good, you will have certain advantages, some NPCs will offer you better deals on items and some companions (playable heroes) will join your side free as opposed to requesting certain money to go on quest with you. So you have certain benefits.\n\nIf you build up your Fame towards bad, you will have different advantages, some NPCs will give you discount (as they are afraid of the bad guy logically) and you will access to Thieves guild where you can purchase additional stuff. So there are some benefits here as well.\n\nWorst thing is acting grey i think, if you do good then bad then good and keep your Fame Neutral, you will not have those extra benefits. \n\nAnyways, my question is; \n\nWould such a system add the game flavor and make it better? Or it will add some unnecessary complexity for player and not worth the extra time to spend on development? \n\nCurious what people think about. \n\n(I will most probably have it in the game, just trying to see whether im making the right call here.)"
mjeiaj,RTS Horror game idea,"(sorry for my English)\n\nthere are zombies out there, you are a commander who lead to soldiers to defend and expand your safe zone maybe collect items from abandoned buildings defend againts waves, save stranded people.\n\ngame starts like normal RTS as game get harder hordes of zombie hordes will be more aggressive and screams of people who eaten alive will be more louder.\n\n AND İt turns out if your soldiers fears to much they will not listen your commands and come back to safe zone and they will bring zombies with them . maybe one zombie not be a problem but of course you don't want screaming dead monsters encircle your home and try to broke your door.\n\nSo actual challenge is not  playing a good RTS but placing some of your soldiers (especially those not carry food) so while zombies eat them other soldiers safely come back with resources. And of course there will be crying and screaming people who want help and loud zombie noise.\n\n And at the and you will have no other choice but to sacrifice all of them and try to save yourself, they will give you some time and you try to escape.Game will turn to a fps inside a dark silent bunker, so eventually you can't escape there will be a jumpscare  and game over.\n\ni don't know is there a game like this or is this a good idea. i want to hear what you think."

mja3fj,Real Time Chess Game AI Voice Commentary,"I was thinking about how tideous it is to get better at chess, with users getting into deep analysis of all their games and all. Then I thought, what about real time chess commentary for every game played?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not quite sure how the full idea would work, but I just imagine playing with another person and then an AI controlled bot makes audio remarks after every move (like if it's a good or bad move, the current opening position if it's a main line or a completely new game, etc) then it could even talk about the potential ideas as to why the move was played. The whole reason for the app isto get players to learn faster, and yes I know there are analysis checkers and all that already, but the AI voice gives it a kind of user friendly touch.\n\n Also it'll be cool if it would have speech synthesis, so the voice sounds like a real human (Perhaps Hikaru for optimal result xD)\n\nP.S.

miy1gz,Text Based Game where you pick the path of your life.,It is designed like a chain. The Choices you can make are numbered based on how many are available. The placement of the choices are random each time and you don't know what they are. You have to pick randomly and hope for the best. Each choice you make affects the next choices you have. The game is meant to be very surreal with the a narrator that forces you to reflect on your actions and how life is.

mip88l,Ultra Run And Jump Mania,"Okay so this is gonna be a long post, but hear me out.\n\nOkay so we all know glitch productions right? The same guys behind meta runner and sunset paradise?\n\nWell I decided to think up an idea for a mobile game that I hope glitch productions considers making, and it’ll be called ultra run and jump mania.\n\nHere’s how I think the tutorial stuff might go.\n\nOn the first level you get the chance to control theo as  elder tomato goes through the tutorial on how to play the game, while on the second level he gets to teach you about enemy’s and how to attack them.\n\nNow this is where the fun starts, as it turns out the first two levels is when the game get’s halted by a pop up saying that you were playing the trial version of the game and that in order to continue, you have to join tascorp, but then the screen glitches for a bit and Sofia shows up knowing that something wasn’t right. She then explains that you have the full version, and that the pop up was an elaborate ruse to make you join tascorp which (SPOILER ALERT) doesn’t treat their meta runners well. She then removes the pop up which unleashes tas-bots and when you try to play the third level tas-bots blocked up the rest of the level and made your Theo fail. So Sofia suggests going back to the starting levels where she’ll explain power ups.\n\nTari- meta blast- she’ll blast away enemy’s \n\nMasa- coconut hack- tosses endless coconuts for a period of time\n\nLamar- nova boost- with help from Nova-Chan you boost through 200 miles in the level.\n\nSofia- mango multiplier- multiplies the amount of banana coins you get.\n\nIt’s then later at level 10 where a tas-boss shows up with lucks warning you to stop playing. You deny of course but then he tries to use the tas-boss to stop you (don’t worry you don’t get sent back to the first two levels if you fail) and of course if you stop him he says that he’ll make you join tascorp one way or another.\n\nSo as you saw there, every 10 levels is a boss level it’ll go on until boss #12 why? Because I plan to include 120 levels in the game, and if the game sells well it could include an update to add 120 more levels. \n\nEach game area in ultra run and jump mania is 30 levels long, with levels 31 to 60 being battle blaze 61 to 90 being food fight, and 91 to 120 being tempest.\n\n(Ending spoiler)\n\nWhen you make it to boss number 12 it shows Belle-bot (which is a tas-bot that looks like Belle) and lucks will tell the player to stop playing the game or else things aren’t gonna be pretty. Of course you ignore him, and when you beat Belle-bot he then deletes every bit of code, but surprisingly you can still see the chat bubbles. He then Shouts at the player saying that he warned the player, he then gives off one final warning telling the player to join tascorp again. Of course your option would be no because tascorp is evil, he then uses a remote to emit painful shocks on Tari,masa, and Lamar. He then explains that during your play through he found a way to hack the arms of the meta runners that were helping you, he then makes an offer saying that if you join tascorp then the shocks stop and and your friends go free, but if you say no then he will reset the entirety of the game. You have no choice you had to say yes. So the shocks stop and you get the good ending, but somehow now you were stuck with lucks. Luckily you get to still use the md-5 power ups for past story levels or endless run mode. OH. I didn’t explain that mode did I. \n\nEndless Run mode: So as you’ve picked up by now ultra run and jump mania is also one of those runner games. So basically that means a mode where you try to get the high score. Now what does this mean for the areas in story mode, you actually can still go to them In endless mode, but mostly through game PORT-als (get it?) you get ported into another game area either it be battle blaze tempest or food fight.\n\nNow some of you are thinking, but where does the money come in? Well let me tell you.\n\nShop: one of the friendlier tas-bots runs the shop, and can offer you costumes for Theo, additional power ups, and more banana coins. The costumes and power ups you buy with banana coins, but you need to buy real money to get more banana coins. The banana coins can also be used to replenish health. But it’s either cheap or expensive depending on how many hearts you have. Another way to replenish health is with tas-cola although it requires something else, it’ll require red star fruit coins in order to get some tas-cola, you either get them from endless run mode or you can buy them at the shop as well(still costs real money though)\n\nWell that’s all I can think up right now. If you would like me to go into detail about the update I have in mind, let me know. I’ll get to work on a part 2 of ultra run and jump mania someday. But for now I need to lay down. I’ve talked too much. *lays down*"
miolmx,Games that you can't create yourself,"I'm searching new ideas to turn into a game, so describle me you dream game that you can't create yourself !"
min3xr,Magicka as full fledged MOBA,"I think it's time to take games like LoL, Dota, Hots etc. To another level.\n\nRemember Magicka by Paradox Interactive? You would use keys to combine elements to create a unique spell. I think that ability concept could create huge replayability, watchability, and massive skill ceiling if it was well implemented into a multi-lane objective based MOBA intended on targeting an esports audience.\n\nParadox made a pvp objective based map that was entertaining but their game obviously wasn't designed for pvp in that sense. \n\nThere's a couple major changes to the concept for the MOBA, firstly 8 elements at once is too much. Cut it down to like 3 at a time like Invoker from Dota2 but with maybe 10 to choose from total before matches. \n\nSecondly not everyone wants to play the same character, make ""roles"" like tank healer etc by limiting the number of elements and their combinations creating the role. Like Earth + Shield+ Nature would be making tanking/healing spells with those combos, or Fire + Lightning + Arcane is some sort of glass cannon mage. Have weapons to vary combat styles, etc.\n\nThe biggest challenges are obviously balance and spell interaction. Should there be a GCD? Powerful spells should have longer CDs or cast times. Add counterplay to spells with noticable animations and cast times etc. Have terrain altering spells but also have other spells that can destroy it with proper element combos.\n\nA super responseive fast-paced moba using this concept would be amazing to watch. There would be innovation in builds and new content could be made by adding weapon types, differing maps like Heroes of the Storm, and items.\n\nThere's a ton of room for innovation while also being super competitive; at higher levels the game would require the APM closer to Starcraft and the mind games with all the spell options would be insane.  I feel like there is a good idea here it just needs good execution."
miloin,Open world survival game. Instead of wildernest you wake up in most dangerous neighbourhood in USA.,As a white man you have to adapt(skill point based) to black culture to not get killed. Just to get to the store to buy food you have to pass through a gang which call you names and you have to pick a smart reply whick could save your life. When time passes you research their slang from rap cds or something to pick smarter replies. Physical defence would be very limited. You can craft a shiv which would be mostly effective against drug addicts and not effective against gang members. You could get a gun later in the game but ammo is very limited and you use it as last resort.

mifb0l,Team-based space (or pirate) game with coop and pvp,"How about a first-person Among Us, but without the impostor gimmick. You play with other people to help run a ship and fight off waves of enemies (PvE gameplay). Each will have a specific task, and cannot multitask. You can either choose as a pilot, mechanic, gunman or any other specific jobs that I haven't think of. It's also possible to battle other player ships or cooperate with other ship against a huge threat (PvP gameplay).\n\nI was inspired by Space Sweepers, the korean movie in Netflix, as well as Among Us (except for the impostor mechanic). In the movie, 4 people runs the ship: a pilot, mechanic, spearman (equivalent to gunman), and captain (vague role, needs replacement).\n\n\n\nThoughts?"

mietfc,A king kong game that takes place when the humans went to skull island,"In the game you play as King Kong and one of the human characters. When you play as King Kong you would fight other giant monsters you would see on the island and sometimes help the human characters with trying to escape the island. Since Kong is known to be smarter than other monsters he would use things in the environment to his advantage like picking up a rock to throw it, using a tree as a melee weapon, etc. When you play as one of the humans it will be more like a third person shooter. I imagine it would have huge uncharted vibes since your discovering new shit and shooting your way out of the island. For the more smaller monsters you will for the mist part be able to shoot then down. But for a more bigger enemy you will have to strategize and try to create traps to help you deal with them. You will have other soldiers or people fighting by your side. You can tell the people what you want them to do like attack a specific enemy, spread out, etc. Like you your allies will have health so they can end up dying. For this game I wouldn’t make it like the original king kong where they capture him, he ends up attacking the city, then is gunned down. I would probably have it like the 2017 one where they all successfully escape and Kong is still alive on the island."

Maybe shining a blinding flashing in the players face with loud commands and backup. Or a drone that tries to rob vending machines and gets chased by police drones."
mnpyt4,Game Idea have lots over the years first time posting hopefully it's not too unbearable,"   Okay so concept is Side Scroller Hack and Slash think Golden Axe 4 player online CO-OP. At the end of the game each plaver fights each other one Victor. Now knowing this between each stage options are given to players to sabotage or help each other. For example Barbarian can't read but two other characters can so they could choose to let him drink poison or not, or one player could tell Barbarian character that it's poison, basically like a Among Us style dialog which could let players plot against each other etc. The affect of said scenario let's say drops Barbarian down 5 levels but doesn't show it in his U/I if he takes said poison.\n\n   So some sabotage and deceit at play to possibly gain an advantage in the end game fight between players. \n\n  Setting : Now I'm thinking still have that fantasy setting but the style is different more cyber punk like. Still have castles, goblins, and dragons etc. But everything is neon Tron Legacy like mixed with fractals, lots of color with dark drops, weird trippy animated space backgrounds. Barbarian has a lasers word Far Cry Blood Dragon vibes of mecha and what not. Lasers like EDM or rave or something. Music trippy like Pink Floyd some trance and techno. Effects from certain attacks making synth sounds that go with the music did I say lasers. Anyway I could go on like I said got a notebook full of ideas even on this game concept but I'm a beginner first time poster hope someone else thinks it's interesting."

Everything takes place on one single zoomable level.,"This idea came to me in a dream and was partly inspired by the beautiful looking Sniper levels seen in Hitman 2, in particular one that has a chateau in it. \n\nI thought, imagine a game where you play as an observer of a single scene, say for example a picturesque mountain with a road winding around it.\n\nYou have the ability to zoom in on any area of the scene before you, you may see something unusual, for example a peculiar looking bird sitting in a tree, you can click on the bird and help him navigate around the tree to an objective. Success!\n\nBut wait, you can now zoom into an egg in its nest..and as you zoom out you find the tree has changed and altered the nearby landscape.\n\nAnd so on and so on, until you realise you can zoom in far closer than you first realised.\n\nUsing colour cues you can see what areas you have yet to complete and indicators show you of zoomable levels you have yet to discover.\n\nThe game would culminate with you finishing a certain number of tasks before you're surprised by the fact that...you're able to zoom out, the initial scene before you now seems much smaller and some curious new objectives await you.\n\nThis would be a very ambient and immersive experience.\n\nZoomZooM"
mng48o,WW2 Historical Strategic Shooter--a blend of Total War and Republic Commando,"I am so damn disappointed that there are almost no games that display WW2 as a truly colossal war. Only a few fronts are ever covered, and a lot aren't important and just dramatize the Allies, like BFV's like of the Soviets, and COD's absence of anything resembling remembrance for the non American 65M deaths...\n\nFirst of all, the game has two mode, the warmap, and the battlefield. The singleplayer is where you choose a campaign from a large selection, arm your units, and deploy them on the warmap. The player is able to move to different positions each turn on the warmap, resulting in different battlefields being fought against different enemies with different allies.

mnfxzu,A Civilization like / 4X game designed for online play that can be completed in about an hour.,"[](/ppoutofnowhere)So if anyone has ever tried to play a 4X game online with friends, you know how much of a colossal commitment it can be. Either everyone has to hunker down for a minimum of 4 hours even for the fastest game mode, or you can play passing turns in a Play-By-Mail style that could take weeks for one game. Trying to play a pick-up game with strangers is pretty much just impossible.\n\nEven on the fastest settings these games can take upwards of 4 hours and 100 turns to complete. The aim here is to cut it down a fairly satisfying experience that can be done in 1 hour or ~50 turns. Compared to most online games an hour is still a pretty big commitment, but compared to others in the genre it's lightning fast and you can still probably fit most of the good bits of a 4X in that session.\n\nThe closest thing I can think of is Settlers of Catan, but it lacks the exploration, expansion and combat depth that makes a good modern 4X.\n\nSome thoughts on what you'd need to make this work:\n\n* Emphasis should probably be on what is normally considered the early to mid game in a 4X where nations are still expanding and building themselves up. A lot of people consider this the most fun aspect anyway. The late game where every scrap of land is claimed and where it becomes a web of political maneuvers or drawn out warfare might need to be de-emphasized.\n* Simultaneous turns are a must. This is pretty successful in most 4X games with one exception: combat. Either the player who can click first has a major advantage or players at war adopt a regular turn schedule which can really slow things down. My thought is that everyone gives their units a queue of orders like ""Capture this mine"" or ""Attack this unit"" and they attempt to accomplish them at the end of the turn in a psuedo-real time way.\n* Obviously infrastructure needs to be pretty simplified so that you can tell at a glance what the situation is and can make decisions quickly. Cut down the number of variables or aggregate them into a handful of easy to digest numbers.\n* Automation of simple tasks like managing what tiles within your borders are being worked or setting up trade routes needs to be on point. At the very least a good Advisor system is needed to point out critical information or give you an idea what you should do next.\n* Since you'll be doing things in a smaller number of turns, you'll probably be spending resources in bigger ""chunks"" that a normal 4X that's divided into many more turns. Being able to queue up a lot of stuff ahead of time is one way to deal with this, but it will probably be common that you'll wind up with some of your resources unspent as you go into the next turn. Maybe being able to spend the resources you didn't spend last turn is the way to go, but if you do that then it might be the better strategy to simply not spend any resources at all until the next turn so you can make decisions with more information. Maybe the solution is to instead make everything immediately spendable instead of having resources like Production or Research that normally build up towards a goal.\n\nAnyway, this was more of an excuse for me to just put my thoughts into writing. This seems to be a very complex problem but would be filling a huge gap in the games market if done well."

mnbegq,Fighting Game where the main focus is weapons,"I’m not talking about weapons that characters have by default. Like, just something they hold that gives them their attacks, no, i’m talking about RPG style weapons. The only difference your choice in character makes is different bonuses and stats. Some also work better with certain types of weaponry. \n\nThere would be a Story Mode, where after completing parts of it you unlock zones you can go to and fight enemies in. Different zones hold different types of enemies which drop different types of weapons, or materials used to craft/upgrade your weapons. \n\nAnother fun feature i was thinking about would be that the ranged weapons would actually use up ammo in fights, making it so you have to go back into areas to get more ammo for your weapons. There aren’t exactly set types of ammo you have to use with certain weapons, but the weapons do have their limits on what kind they can fire as well as kinds that work better and have bonuses when used with certain weapons."

mn5c84,A Dune inspired. Desert survival game.,"(obviously nothing alike with dune, other than the desert setting and Sandworm) You start out in a cave with almost no recollection of who you are, or where you came from. You eventually have to get yourself out of that cave, by either mining out, or climbing out, but once you do, that was just the first step. After leaving the cave, you escape into a Vast, Huge, Saharan like desert, that almost looks infinite. The game wont tell you much, other than some hints with wind direction to the closest little outskirt town. (like the game mechanic from Ghost of Tsushima) Once you arrive to that town, (the only town in the game) You notice a variety of people, including traders, bounty hunters, butchers, shop owners, and a lively town. You ask around the little area, for details of where you are, and over time you learn about the Sand Worm, or some sort of Monster, that lurks these Dunes. Over time in the game, you explore the vast land, and see many different encounters, of learning, surviving, and dominating. Obviously this game would be first person, and if it could be made, the Sand Worm fight, could be amazing. What do you guys think of something like this?"

mn489p,Everfall - fleshed out and interesting description,
mn211m,A city-builder with more (Tropico meets Crusader Kings?),"I've been playing Tropic 6 lately, and been thinking about how cool it would be to have a city-builder in that style, but with more detailed interactions with the inhabitants in your city. \n\nI'm imagining a city-building game set in a medieval city, or maybe an ancient Greek city state. The majority of the citizens of your city are nameless peasants who you don't interact with outside of the way you usually do in most city builders (keeping them happy to keep the tax money flowing), but within your city there are a few prominent noble families, whose members are simulated in much more detail. They have their own family trees, skills and traits, and ambitions. The nobles participate in their own schemes and plots which may end up helping or hurting your rule, and the city as a whole. You have to manage them in ways that balances keeping your sitting functioning well (placing your most competent nobles in important roles in jobs administration, etc.) with keeping them happy so they don't revolt. You would play the role of one of these characters (like you do in Crusader Kings), so you have to balance the needs of the city with taking care of your family.\n\nI guess what I am imagining is Crusader Kings, but it plays out in the context of city-builder, rather than on a world-map.   As in Tropico, there would still be some interaction with the world outside of your city through trade and foreign relations, as well as through doing things like marrying off your nobles to the rulers of other cities, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThoughts?"
mmyz7a,2D vs 3D for an underwater sci-fi game,"Hey all,\n\nI'm having a weird problem and really struggle with a pitch I have for a game to create. First I'm a pretty experienced game developer so 2d or 3d doesn't matter in terms of my capabilities.\n\nThe game I think about is an underwater sci-fi game in an open world where mankind had to move under the water surface due to some catastrophic event (e.g. WWIII). Games like Archimedean Dynasty/Aquanox come into my mind. The player shall start with an old and rusty ship and be able to dock to different stations, do some trading, buy better equipment, explore the world, find abandoned stations, weird creatures, maybe even some ancient stuff...\n\nI'm a huge fan of open world sandbox games, modular design, crafting, exploration and stealth. Still not sure if in a multiplayer world or ""just"" single player.\n\nAll in all I simply cannot make the decision to do this real time underwater exploration and combat game in 2d (top down!) or 3d. I know most games nowadays are 3d and there are lots of reasons for it but I also enjoy very much playing 2d games. Heat Signature, FTL, Sunless Sea, Barotrauma come into my mind here.\n\nSo what are your opinions about 2d vs 3d for such a game? Any ideas, reasons why you would prefer one or the other? Are there even players out there still playing 2d games like me?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome of my pros and cons and ideas:\n\n**2D PRO + ideas**\n\n* easier controls\n* randomly generated world (e.g. Diablo) with caves\n* stealth like gameplay with stations to dock and explore, computer terminals to hack into\n* 2D sonar like gameplay which is easier to implement than 3d sonar\n* dynamic and modular ship design (players can assemble ship modules to entire ships which can lead to weird designs)\n\n**2D CONS**\n\n* players might prefer 3d nowadays\n* no VR, no cockpit, less ""shooter like action""\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**3D PRO + ideas**\n\n* much more immersive world and cockpit centric gameplay with possible VR\n* using existing terrain engine to cover huge areas of the Earth\n* different depth levels =&gt; yes, the 3rd dimension kicks in!\n\n**3D CONS**\n\n* more time consuming to develop\n* randomly created worlds harder to do\n* stations might be less fun with all those hidden puzzles? (e.g. computer terminals)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for your time and reading! Any help is much appreciated."
mmw9xb,"Daredevil, the game","The challenge here is that Daredevil is blind, but has heightened senses to perceive the world in different ways. \n\nI envision a third-person game that combines traversal, stealth and combat, like *Assassin's Creed* or the *Arkham* games. In open roaming or combat situations, Daredevil's ""radar sense"" lets him perceive his immediate surroundings clearly, but not distant objects. They're in monochrome, as he can't perceive color nor read text at a distance. \n\nTapping the X button makes him stomp his foot or tap his billy club on a wall. This creates a sonar-like pulse that reveals more distant objects, including through walls. These are vague figures until they are closer.\n\nHolding the X button makes Daredevil focus his senses on a particular target and reveal things like their size, their weapons, their heart rate (level of alertness), and what they are saying. \n\nIn mini-boss and boss fights, Daredevil has to use his senses to detect the weaknesses of his enemies, like a trick knee or bad lungs, and execute specific attacks to exploit them. \n\nLoud noises can ""blur"" areas, and advanced enemies will use tools like flash-bang grenades to disrupt him.\n\nThe tutorial level is young Matt Murdoch, recently blinded, using his abilities to stealth through the hospital to find his new mentor, Stick. \n\nThere's a mini-game of Daredevil using his abilities to question people, monitoring their heart rate and breathing like a polygraph. He can also track people by their scents. \n\nDaredevil starts with a plain billyclub, and can develop different maneuvers with it. As the game progresses, he can equip different weapons (staff, tonfas, rope darts, etc)."
mmu6uz,The Machine of Life: A steampunk survival-y game.,"Note: I do want to make this myself, I just want to discuss the idea and look for feedback. The only roadblock currently is the fact that I cant make models and still have to learn.\n\nIn this game you play as an engineer, who has just made a machine which can replace the heart, and give immortality. The problem, it requires constant fueling, and you plugged yourself in without thinking about that. Now you have to keep the machine running while doing other things.\n\nThe main mechanic is of course the Machine of Life. You need to keep it fueled, but if it has full fuel, you die because of a heart attack. If it has no fuel, you die because your heart stopped.\n\nyour movement speed also depends on the speed of the clock, which depends on the amount of fuel.\n\nMore Fuel = Faster Speed\n\nI just need to figure out what the other things you have to do should be.

mmot46,"""""Doomsday"" tell me what you think:)","So this is an idea I had for a game a while back:\n\nThe basic premise is Vampires vs Super Humans. It's the year 2030 and Vampires have taken over the world. A group of human scientists are working on a way to fight back. It takes months of hard research and testing but they finally come with a solution - a virus. They call it the Doomsday Virus. This virus will grant a human supernatural abilities, however there is a catch. Every shot they take will bring them one step closer to death. \n\nYou start off as a Vampire born into a wealthy family. Your mother and father are regarded as royalty in the eyes of the Vampire community. One day though a group of scientists kidnap you and inject you with the Doomsday Virus (to further their studies). However because of tour Vampire abilities the Virus does not slowly kill you. Furthermore it enhances your already powered Vampire abilities, making you feel stronger and faster than the average vampire. The scientists have to restrain tou and cryo freeze him to stop you.\n\nYou awake in the year 2030 (this is where the game starts) to a different world than you once knew. You now have the abilities of a Vampire and a Super Human, with none of the backlash. Which side will you will choose? Will you team up with you're mother and father and wipe out the remaining humans? Will you turn them all into mindless slaves? Or will you side with the Super Humans and destroy what is left of the vampires, including your own family?\n\nSo that's the story of it. Gameplay mechanics are:\n\nChoice system: Every choice you make has an effect. \n\nInfluence System: You have an influence system where whatever choices you make you will either gain influence for the Vampires or the Super Humans (for example there will be a certain point on the story where you meet a vampire willing to lend you his help. If you accept you will gain a lot of influence with the Vampires. If you refuse you will have to fight him a few mins later and after you defeat him you will gain influence for the Super Humans). Influence can also be gained through a variety of actions and methods. You can gain small influence by killing lesser vampires or super humans. You can complete quests for moderate influence gain. Beat down big a  boss and you'll gain a huge amount for the appropriate faction. The possibilities are endless.\nInfluence will also dictate price rates at Favtion Vendors.\n\nFaction System: there are 2 factions on the game (maybe 3 I haven't decided, but the 3rd will be NPC only) Vampire and Super Humans. About halfway through the game a custscene will happen where you have to choose your Faction. Once you have joined your chosen faction you will unlock Faction specific gear that you couldn't access previously. Bear in kind though that the other Faction gear will be locked to you. Note: influence does not affect which faction you will join.\n\nFaction Vendors: these are located by looking for the faction symbol on a banner outside the shop. These are the guys you want to visit if you want faction gear (the best gear in the game). It will be costly but worth it. You can always lower the cost more by gaining more influence too!\n\n""Adversary"" system: not to copy a game idea but this is sort of like the Nemesis system on SoM and SoW. However YOU are a part of this system aswell. Basically it's a system of the top ranking Vampires/Super Humans. However its YOUR OWN FACTION. The idea around this is you will fight other people in your faction in either a 1v1 duel (which is easier) or out in the open world (harder as other enemies will be around) . I'd you beat them you get a number of ranking points. The more ranking points you have the higher you will climb and you will lbe awarded new ranks at a certain number of points. The higher your rank the better gear you can equip and you also gain a better daily salary (yes you get a daily salary depending on your rank and your level)\n\nParty System: You can take up to 3 NPC's into combat with you . The more in your party the harder the enemies will be. But the more exp you will gain. Bear in mind that exp will be shared among party members and you will be able to customize your party members with gear and stats.\n\nLevel Progression: dont need to explain this one do I guys? Standard rpg level progression with stats and skills.\n\nA number of other activites: you will be able to do a number of other various activities this can include hanging out with your party in the pub or romancing the local girl and taking her on dates. There will be a few more things to do other than level and questing.\n\nThat's all I got so far guys. (Althougj i admit that's quite a bit haha)\n\nTell me what you think?"

You'd be able to select a loadout before the mission, which would be a selection of spells, potions, and dark magic detection devices."
mmg7d5,SCP survival game,"I’m a massive fan of survival games, stuff like rust and especially Ark. and I also like the fictional characters in the scp universe, so why not try and mix the two together. This game will be a survival just like ark, but you are in a dark forest with different scp wondering about (some passive some hostile) you can gather materials and work on building your scp foundation (can build structures such as Scp room A, Scp room B and Scp room C. Each room will be specific in materials, like room A will need much stronger materials for the walls and doors, so it can hold the stronger and much more dangerous Scp’s) breaking trees, rocks and mining materials can grab the attention of wondering Scp’s so you’ll definitely need some sort of weapon to protect yourself (pistols, shotguns, SMGs and rifles) \nThat was the main description of the game. so now I’ll go into more detail about certain things \n\nThe map:\nThe map will be set map with randomly generated materials such as stone, wood and different types of minerals. It will be a dark forest with caves plotted here and there. The forest will be extremely dark and completely overgrown. The only way you can see is with a torch, flare or flashlight.\n\nScp’s: \nThe map will be scattered with many different types of scp, some small some colossal. These different Scp’s will be completely different to eachother (ideas for the Scp’s can be easily found online) these roaming Scp’s can be super friendly or super aggressive and sometimes a Scp can seem friendly but then can rip you in half unexpectedly. Every single Scp can be “tamed” they will have different ways to be tamed such as knock out. Helping it find its food. Raising the Scp from a young age. Or even creating your own Scp. You will be able to play as each Scp (or pilot them depending on what type) mid way through the game you can unlock a machine (haven’t thought of a name yet) that will let you take over the mind of your Scp. Each Scp has a different set of abilities. Some may be able to see in the dark. Some can move at incredible speeds and maybe some can scare off other Scp’s with its terrifying look. (While not controlling an Scp it has a chance of becoming hostile, trying to kill you and your other Scp’s, so keeping them locked up will prevent that from happening)\n\nCombat: \nCombat is going to be decently hard to get right, but what I was thinking was an ark type combat but after you kill a creature it’ll show a little animation of you tearing off body parts or swallowing them whole. But as a player you have a set of weapons/tools that you could use to fight off Scp’s, early game items can be things such as metal swords, spears and maybe even a bow, late game items will have thing like guns, electric prods and even power armour. \nNot quite sure what else to talk about with the combat haven’t thought it out fully yet, would love to hear feed back if possible.\n\nCrafting/material gathering:\nGathering materials would be simple, you start off with nothing, you have to find rocks on the floor to help you break trees to get wood, you then use the wood to craft tools, such as hatchet, pick axe and a knife to help you gather more materials. Later on after making your pick axe you can go deep in caves to find iron, copper and other metals. You can then use these metals to upgrade your tools or maybe build traps for the Scp’s or places to keep your Scp safe and secure. \nAdding a crafting bench system seems like a good idea and maybe for the late game you can build an advanced crafting table so you can learn more advanced tools such as a jack hammer, or better guns.\n\nBuilding: \nBuilding is so hard to get right in games \nEspecially one like this, but I believe building should be looked at and inspected by someone who has a better idea than me. \n\nOther:\nThis game is going to be decently hard. Where if you are not wearing armour you can be taken on in surprise and have your legs and arms ripped off in a second, so making armour and weapons is important. The map can be decently large with mountains, caves and very dense overgrown forests. Scp’s will have their own noise so you can tell if one is near by. Each Scp has their own weakness. \n\nSorry if some of this didn’t make any sense or it’s a completely shit idea \nI’m a 15 year old at 2AM trying to think about what game I would want to play. \nFeel free to build upon this idea or if needed tell me that it’s completely shit. \nThanks for taking the time to read this \nSeriously this is a long ass idea because I tried to go in depth as I possibly could, but I may have forgotten some key features because I am very tired."
myke4z,Game idea,Make a VR horror game we’re there is a creepy shadow in your room you have to look at to make them disappear. You have to survive till the morning. You have to get sleep every now and then to regain energy or you will fall asleep. If you are sleeping and the shadow is close it will start whispering and then if you don’t wake up you die. But if you do wake up you have to turn on the lights to scare the shadow away. The light has a battery and will run out if you use it too much. That’s my game idea and I hope someone finds it interesting and creates it.

myj0if,Frankenstein: Tabula Rasa,"*Frankenstein: Tabula Rasa* is a third-person action-adventure sandbox game based on the classic novel by Mary Shelley.\n\nThe game opens with the Creature literally being born from Dr. Frankenstein's laboratory. This sequence is the game's tutorial, as Frankenstein performs experiments on his Creature to see how it moves and thinks, introducing the player to basic concepts like movement, inventory, combat, and social interaction with branching menus. This also sets up tensions between the Creature's desires and Frankenstein's sometimes-cruel orders. \n\nIn a cut scene, the Creature disobeys Frankenstein to see outside, and the doctor decides that his creation is too dangerous to be allowed to live. The Creature narrowly escapes its death, destroying the laboratory and nearly killing the doctor in the process. \n\nNow out in the world, the Creature has to meet the immediate concerns of survival by figuring out how to live in the woods. After that, the player has many options: scavenge and hunt for food, steal from villagers, befriend them, develop body or intellect, help or harm. The community will react, by hunting down a thief or giving offerings to a helper. \n\nAs the game progresses, the player has many options for how to develop the Creature, which has several skill and power trees. However, there will always be an opportunity cost. Make the creature bigger and stronger to master combat and it becomes worse at stealth and traversal. Give the Creature more powers and it looks less human, cutting off social options. Its lair will have different abilities depending on location. \n\nRegardless of what the Creature does, Frankenstein will periodically return as the nemesis, always thinking the worst. Frankenstein will turn the villagers against the Creature, destroy the Creature's lairs, and attack its allies. The Creature, in turn, has the option of striking back at Frankenstein.\n\nAll of this builds into a final confrontation, as the Creature heads for the North Pole and Frankenstein pursues it."

myfdd3,New Guitar Hero game idea,"Hi I have this idea for a new Guitar Hero Game I call it Guitar Hero Chronicles, the main part of the game is that in the distant future music is dead which caused the world to live in silence until a ancient prophecy is furfilled by a wannabe Guitarist by finding a old guitar and summons the God Of Rock knowing that as long as instruments exist music has a chance of bringing rock back to the world.\n\nThe story begins at the grave yard where the Guitar Heroes you know and love are resting in peace until realizing that the the world is without music they rise from the grave to bring rock back to the world forever.\n\nThe story will go out like Guitar Hero Warriors Of Rock but this time you must play music to resurrect the undead Guitar Heroes until they are fully resurrected, the set list would be songs from previous Guitar Hero Games from Guitar hero 1 to Guitar hero live as a homage to all Guitar Hero Games with new songs coming to the game in the form of Encores.\n\nThere will be a Character Creator with loads of creation features also a customisable Hypersphere where you can create your own effects.\n\nThere could be downloadable content but i got this idea the game could work with Apple music to bring a load of song variety to the game there could be a subscription service and an option to buy the song and keep it forever to add to your song collection so when the license expires you can keep it.\n\nOK now the important part the Guitar Controller there should be only Guitars in Guitar Hero Chronicles to give the game the nostalgic vibe from the first three games my idea for the controller is to have Six buttons instead of Five like the Controller Prototype from the cancelled Guitar Hero 7 from 2012 and some new ideas I came up with is that we could change the setup of the controller like take the Six basically buttons off and you could add Twelth buttons Six on top and Six on the bottom and you could choose between the classic Strum Bar and Six Replica Guitar Strings to give the game a more realistic experience the controllers would be made by cheap resources and materials so they would be more cost effective like Recycled plastics etc.\n\nAnd for online it would be like Tik Tok but its all Rock Music you could challenge friends to Guitar Duels a classic Guitar Hero Mode and you can submit Community Creations: Custom Characters and Hypersphere scapes and you can record yourself or your Character and post it on the service just like Tik Tok again with just Rock Music and Rock Music Only!\n\nThe game would be on Basic Console Platforms Xbox Series X, PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch, I'm not including PC because um cough Clone Hero Cough. PS There could be exclusive cosmetics for each platform.\n\nSo there you have it my idea for the new next generation Guitar Hero.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nYours sincerely\n\nBrett Adam Dorling\n\nhttps://www.ideaincite.com/Activision/Idea/new-guitar-hero-game"

mydpzn,Plush Planet: A 1st person competitive multiplayer teddy bear video game for kids,"Feel free to use this idea.\n\nIn this game, there can be up to 8 players.  Each person plays as a stuffed animal, and there are 8 to choose from: a teddy bear, rag doll, dog, cat, alien, goat, monkey and a duck.  The view is first person, the movement is 3d, and it’s open world.\n\nThe scenery is completely plush. All the objects, buildings, the ground, and everything else is plush. It’s like a big teddy bear world.\n\nThere are 3 games to play.  They are:\n\nBoing!     This is a bouncy game where everyone jumps around. The objective is to jump on other players’ heads.  You gain a point every time you land on another player. The height of the jump depends on how long you hold the jump button down. You can bounce off of walls too.  The player with the most points after 5 minutes wins. \n\nBop!     In this game, every player has a nerf ball gun. It’s like laser tag, but with nerf balls. Unlimited ammo.  You earn a point every time you hit another player. The player with the most points after 5 minutes wins.\n\nZoom!     This game is a race. There are lots of obstacles to jump over.   The course should take you through a plush city.\n\nIn all of the games, players are ranked 1 through 8 at the end of the game. You can play against other players, or against bots. Players should connect to the server for competitive play. You can arrange a game with your friends, or be randomly assigned opponents."

mybbb8,I don't know what to call it but it would be a heavily story based game where you're supposed to find out the story as you go.,"I'm not good at this, i literally just asked a question to my dad yesterday and thought it would be cool. I have no gameplay elements or anything, it's just a very small thing to build on.\n\nSo what i had in mind is a world where everywhere in the world, an emergency news broadcast would be shown saying that there's a horrible new disease that has appeared, tell the symptoms they have found, how many infected people have been reported, etc.. Except the disease was completely made up, but people started having symptoms because they thought they could have it, and the news would keep pushing that the disease is growing. People would be brainwashed into believing they have symptoms for a disease that doesn't exist, which is something possible that has been tested before, where two groups of people would get a ""new medication"" to help something they had, both groups would be told the symptoms they could get from the pills but omly one of them got pills that actually had something in them, yet both groups got symptoms.\n\nTL;DR Story is the world gets an emergency new broadcast telling them about a disease that doesn't actually exist, and people start believing they have it. Kind of like mass hysteria i suppose. Populations start going insane, and the player is trying to find out the truth."

If missed any arrow, you have got three lives. Well it will start slow and then the speed eventually increases.\n\nModes:\nI thought of three modes here\n\na) Here you'll get list of some songs which you can select and play \n\nb) Challenge mode: This mode the default mode, songs will come randomly and user have to play ( Thinking to make it level one, no idea for it, help will be thankful)\n\nc) Zen Mode: This mode will provide user calm and slow music, with endless beat. Yes there will be unlimited lives, no worry, if the arrow is missed.\n\n\nSo this is what i thought of. \nIf you guys can tell what more i can do, and yes especially how's the idea for the beginner level. \n\nDo comment so we can discuss 😇"
my9q7f,Romeo and Juliet in the hood,"I had this idea for a movie years ago, and it’s always kind of in the back of my mind. A city with two major gangs who are constantly at war with one another over turf. Then two star crossed lovers from the rival gangs meet and fall in love and yadda yadda yadda. Characters can of course be any ethnicity or gender because it’s 2021 and who gives a shit. Obviously chaos happens because of them constantly trying to keep secrets/ hide their relationship. The game would be a very raw look into the poverty faced in impoverished communities. The idea of developing some sort of hustle to keep from starving or making enough money for rent. I marked it as AAA because my vision would be very realistic, but it doesn’t have to be open world. More realistic run ins with Police Officers would be a nice addition. It doesn’t have to be true to Shakespeare but the addition of character development (emotionally rather than stat based) would be nice. Something like your options broaden as you come to learn more about yourself/character. Unlike a GTA, murders and robberies have a lot more consequences both in the world and in your future available actions. Basically I want like The Wire in video game form with dynamic characters that are facing real life (albeit cherry picked) situations. I think it could potentially make a good movie, but also possibly an incredible video game as it would be more interactive and the user would be more engaged with the material. Also diving into the relationship between characters would be cool. Not like Fable (which I love so no hate) where you get married and check on your S/O every now and again. I want the relationship to be complicated and integral. Maybe I’m on to something maybe not. Feel free to run with it. \n\n(If you are curious as to why I haven’t written said movie, it’s because I predominantly write humor and kids’ stories. I am unsure I have the emotional depth or writing skills to make it as good as I want it to be.)"
my8wgu,"Dating sim: you're an anime catgirl in the middle of an anime convention. The twist: you have no idea how did you get there, how you can escape, and where is your catlike sisters","It would play either like doki doki, that the characters become more and more obsessed in you, or maybe like a turn based rpg, that you have to damage the enemies by saying the right words or making the right actions.\n\nA cool idea would be to have the start of the game be about you just exploring your village and talking to other catgirls, then you discover a portal or you're summoned by a horny teenage guy/gal and now have to try to get back\n\nIt can also be a simple stealth game. A top down where you have to sneak between scenario objects and get to the end of the level without being noticed"
my3hyv,Quest Based cat game.,"You play as a small cat in the big city who is always looking for mischief. Scattered around the town you can find a variety of other city cats that you can meet, interact with and complete tasks for. Many of their tasks will have you fetch them something out of their reach and usually belonging to humans. You will always be rewarded for completing tasks with food, the games primary currency. You can use food to buy a variety of items and even give them to other cats so they can teach you new abilities, like scratching to attack enemies like dogs or meowing which can be used to draw in humans and get them to give you food. The game would have a huge Untitled Goose Game vibe, annoying the hell out of humans and snatching their stuff."

mxy2v4,"Don’t Nap - A game in which you are a preschooler, it’s nap time, and you don’t want to take a nap.","Had this idea because I work at a preschool and a rendition of this is played every day at nap time. I have no knowledge of game design, so I’m sorry if the flair is wrong. I’m guessing the AI would be really difficult to program.\n\n\n- 3D unity game\n\n\n- Stealth-focused gameplay. Similar to Slender or Baldi’s Basics.\n\n\n- objective: There are dozens of different toys (blocks, matchbox cars, dolls, etc) laying around a classroom. You must “play” with all of them without being spotted by the teacher. In order to play with a toy, you walk up to it, press a button on your keyboard/controller, and a 2 second progress timer bar counts down. After this, you have officially “played” with that toy and can move onto the next one. After you’ve played with all the toys, you get a message saying that you’re sleepy, and you must return to your cot. Upon returning to the cot, you win the game.\n\n________________________\n\n- The teacher: the teacher patrols the classroom. They get more vigilant after every toy you play with. Starting out just reading a newspaper; and actively searching for you by the last toy. If the teacher sees you, they give chase, and they’re faster than you so escaping is possible but not recommended. If the teacher catches you once, they put you back in your cot, and go into the hardest mode for the remained of the game. If you get caught again, it’s game over.\n\n________________________\n\n- Your cot. You start the game on your nap time cot. If you are on your cot, you are safe, and if the teacher sees you on the cot, they will return to their desk temporarily. Once you’ve played with a few toys, of the teacher sees your cot empty, they will actively search for you instead of passively patrolling.\n\n_________________\n\n- Other obstacles. There are a few other obstacles to avoid that will alert the teacher to your location. The teacher will go to the obstacle to investigate, so if you trigger one, it’s best to get away from that general area as quickly and quietly as possible.\n\n\n- Loose items. Loose items can be knocked over if you’re not careful. They will make a noise that draws the teacher to them.\n\n\n- Squeaky floorboards. There’s a subtle visual cue for which boards are squeaky. \n\n\n- Tattletales. Some of the other sleeping children will get woken up if you get too close to them, and will shout “teacherrrr!” This draws the teacher to the kid.\n\n\n- Paint bucket. This is a loose item that can be knocked over and alert the teacher. However, it can also be used to your advantage. When the teacher finds the paint spill on the floor, they will spend ten seconds or so cleaning the spill and ignore you. It’s placed somewhere in the classroom where there’s not much cover, though. So it’s a high risk, high reward strategy.\n\n__________\n\n\n- Getting around. You can either walk or crawl. Walking is faster but louder, crawling is slower but more stealthy."

mxsu9m,NIGHT EYE,"Night Eye is an neo-noir, action adventure role playing game set in the fictional, sprawling metropolis of New Brighton in the year 2097. Players take on the role of hardened veteran, grizzled ex cop and current private investigator Dominic Rayne (Dom). After being hired by an old woman to investigate the sudden disappearance of her grand daughter, a teenaged girl named Farah Sweeney with seemingly psychic abilities, Dom slowly uncovers a massive conspiracy involving corrupt police, shady government officials and a top secret military program involving the worlds first fully sentient AI computer. Dominic must delve into New Brightons underworld and take on gangsters, Mob bosses, corrupt cops and various other criminals, through questionable means. Players can also develop alliances with various NPC’s invluding Dequan Morris, a current NBPD police officer recently demoted from the NBPD’s anti corruption unit, and Charlene “Ma” Russo, a local crime boss. Players can take on side missions to gain loot and money to help progress through the main storyline, mainly stemming from the NBPD’s failure to address various crimes throughout the city. \n\nDominic lost his right eye and right arm in the great Russian War of the 2070’s and had a “smart eye” and “smart arm” installed, which allows him various abilities such as heat view and being able to see soundwaves, as well as being able to copy fingerprints and add various software mods to high tech weapons. These can be unlocked throughout the game. \n\nIn my vision, the gameplay would essentially feel like a cross between Cyberpunk 2077, La Noire and Control. I know this will never actually get made, but its a concept thats been floating in my head for some time.\nIf anyone would like to add some ideas to this for fun that would be awesome."

mxpuqn,"A Hero FPS, but with a more tactical streak","# Preface\n\nBefore getting into the concept, what do you guys enjoy about Hero FPS'? This idea sprung out of what I enjoy the most in the genre and also after a re-watch of Shammy's video [""An Actual Review of Overwatch &amp; Paladins,""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MciMuVUmrQM&amp;t=1666s) this post being almost a ""what I would do to make a game in this genre"" for me. \n\nNow, without further ado, let's begin. \n\n# Game Mode and Hero Skill Trees\n\nThis is the core part of the game and what distinguishes it from the others on the same genre. \n\nEach hero has a skill tree that contains active and passive skills, the tree itself composed of two main braches (with active skills) and secondary branches (with passive skills). Depending on the game mode, this tree will develop in different ways, but the key thing is: all heroes can perform, at least, two distinct functions (not at the same time) in a team composition, it all depends on the way you assign points in the tree. I'll elaborate on that later, as this is a core mechanic of the competitive game mode I planned. \n\nThe principal game mode would be called ""Charges,"" where two teams of nine players dispute control points in three stages, the team with most points (the control points are worth a certain quantity of points) wins. Before the match properly begins, both teams can organize themselves, develop a strategy, and decide what kind of team composition they'll run. Each player will get 1 active skill point to assign at this moment, choosing their primary skill to persist on the first round. \n\n1st Charge: Three Control Points, each one worth 200 points.\n\n* Teams distribute their players around the map at different points, to seize the distinct controls points faster; \n* 6 minutes of duration;\n* After a control point is reclaimed, the other team can't have it back;\n* Dominating a control point requires a majority in the area + 1min and 30sec;\n* If a control point isn't reclaimed until the end of the charge, it will belong to the team with the majority in that area + that spent more time there;\n* The first player of each team to die at this stage will continue dead till the end of the match; \n* No respawns; \n* Happens in the first part of the map, each map has two parts; \n\n2nd Charge: Two Control Points, each one worth 500 points. \n\n* Before this stage begins, all players will get to assign a new active skill point and, for each control point seized, an amount of passive skill point(s). e.g. Two Control Points = Two Passive Skill Points.\n* 9 minutes of duration;\n* Dominating a control point requires a majority in the area + 3min and 30sec;\n* Will take place at the second part of the map; \n* Everything else stays the same; \n\n3rd Charge: One Control Point, worth 1000 points. \n\n* Before the last stage, all players will, again, get to assign a new active skill point and, for each control point seized, an amount of passive skill point(s). This part is important since, because each main branch of the skill tree has 2 active skills and an ultimate, this is the moment they'll get their ult or, if they distributed active skill points in both main braches, get their third skill. \n* 12 minutes of duration; \n* There are 10 minor objectives that will allow players to collect 1000 points (100 per objective), making it viable to focus on minor objectives instead of the major one, which might be a sound strategy depending on team composition; \n* Will make use of the entire map; \n* Dominating the major control point will demand 7 minutes in total + player majority. \n\nAbout the dead players: they'll get to communicate with their teams and also assist them with the minor objectives, so it's encouraged to be present and active at that position. \n\nThe chief thing I want to invest in here is a variety of team composition and play style. So you can have teams that manage a good early-mid game, but become weaker at the last charge. Other teams that focus heavily on the mid-late game. Compositions centered around a certain hero (a carry, you could say) or dependent on combos. Teams that attempt to control points together, others that distribute themselves. \n\nPS.: The chosen heroes would persist till the end of the match. \n\nThere is some stuff I'm sort of unsure about, so feedback would be great. \n\nI don't know how much this alternative would interest players of the genre, but it strikes me as a cool concept. Especially on how much it relies on good team composition, communication and clever character building, yet somewhat allowing for a high level of freedom and player agency."

So it would be really cool if there was a MOBA game that was very forgiving in terms of harware setup and it would be really cool if it was also avaible on Linux. One of the reasons why League of Legends is so popular is that it can be played on very low end hardware, but if it would be took to the next level by creating a MOBA that had very low requirements it would be great. Also any game developers nowadays should make their games Linux avaible so it can be enjoyed by everyone (including Linux users like me)"

mxnday,"a game about letters(I’m sorry if this isn’t the right flair, I don’t know how hard this would be to code.)","so, I was in keyboarding class the other day. We were doing an assignment where we were given an example letter, and told to edit out the mistakes. That gave me an idea. A game where you play as someone who professionally proofreads letters and edits out mistakes. BUT. You not only have the opportunity to edit out typos, but also to change the contents of the letter as a whole. For example, a CEO could be sending a letter to another company asking for a partnership or something like that, but the player has the opportunity to change that letter into, for example, some kind of threat. The player could also change the person the letter is sent to, or the person the letter claims to be coming from. In this way, it would almost be a little bit like Needful Things in that the player would be sort of wiring people together and playing them off one another. Is this a good idea?"
mxltp0,Evolve/royale/amongus abomination,"So basically I was thinking about a game like evolve (1 playable monster many other players working to kill each said monster) then I thought what if it was set in the predator universe. The logical conclusion is that it should be a battle royale type thing where the predators compete for kills and the humans try to survive turning around the boring ass start game of evolve into something fast pass. Then how does some one win. In my idea the predator with the most kills wins and/or the humans who survive till the end win. However it would not be so cool if out of 100 humans 50 manage to get on the helicopter/whatever else gets them away so instead they also have to compete/kill for a limited number of spots. This is the among us type gameplay. Do the predators work together to kill or try to kill steal. Do the humans make one big group or many small groups that battle other it out at the end leaving them open. What happens when the heli comes down and 30 guys in a big group are left. \n\nIt could also be scaled down to much smaller groups instead of 100v? It could be more like 20v2 since this seems quite niche. \n\nI think it might solve some of the boring starts of evolve, the one dimensional style of royale games, and the unengaging gameplay of among us. \n\nOnly used predators as an example to show inspiration since it was pretty crucial to my thought process."
mxktpu,Play behind the scenes of a platformer,"The player is tasked with keeping testing chambers running while robots are being run through them. The player can push buttons and pull levers behind the scenes in order to stop floors from collapsing, rebuild tubes and wiring, and remove or rebuild dead robots. The player succeeds when a test subject makes it to the end of their room. Probably easiest as a 2d game."

No pausing, no saving or quitting, just the entire 6 hour game in one sitting.\n\n It starts simple, you got some tasks to do, put away some items, water plants, clean the floor, etc. Every task is replaced with a new one in each day cycle of 10 minutes with light outside being your only time indicator.  After a while, you notice something. Sometimes tasks disappear, the days seem to be shorter. Tasks you swore you've done are suddenly back on your task board. But you don't worry about it. It's probably nothing.....was your bed always red? More tasks reappear and disappear, days only seem to last 5 minutes now, items you need for your task aren't in the same place you left them, the rooms in your house change, what's going on? It's getting worse, days, tasks, item, your own house. Days last seconds, task disappear just as quickly as they appear. You move forward, you're in the bathroom? Kitchen? You can't tell, everything is unfamiliar. Finally, there are no more tasks, no more day cycles, everything is a flat grey, your controls seem random, everything you once known is unfamiliar, it's gone...... Things slowly fade, first the color grey, then the empty task bar, and piece by piece you slowly fade away. As the final notes of the song play, you loose the ability to do anything in the game as the final minute of silence plays.... \n\n# Disclaimer: This is not my idea but I would like to share this idea because I like it."

mxc4db,An evolution MMORPG,When the sever starts everyone can only play as a very basic default animal. The aim of the game is to reproduce. Everytime you give birth you will be able to slightly alter the genetics of your offspring. When you die you have to choose from your closest genetic offspring. If you don't have any children and you die you have to play your closest living genetic relative. Overtime creatures will get more complex as irreversible changes are made. E.g. if you evolve a creature with four legs you can suddenly grow more. When new player join they can choose to take over any animal control by the aim but they will be restricted to choose it's closest relatives after choosing it. If the player leave the AI will take ove and when they join they will have to choose one of its descendents or it's closest relatives if there are none. If the AI has offspring mutations will be random.

mx4oik,A funny casual game about what you could do with random objects.,"Hi guys, I just got some idea about an open world casual game, that could may be on either mobile, pc or web-based.\n\n#CONCEPT;\n\nAll players are the citizen of a city. At the start of the game, they are assigned with 3 different items. Each time they correctly uses it, they earn points based on how they use them. The weirder the use, the higher the point.\n\nThey could spend points to buy more items from the shop located in the city, or they can pick up random items on the street.\n\nThe match ends after 5 or 6 minutes.  Players will be ranked based on the amount of points they earned.\n\n#IN - DEPTH:\n\nWhen participating this game, you will be the resident of a crowded city. You are free to roam across the city.\n\nYou will be given 3 different items in the beginning. This can be as simple as an apple, a piece of paper or a cup; be a vehicle like a car; or even be a destructive weapon as an atomic bomb.\n\nEach item has a list of interactions that you can do with it. \n\n&gt;For example, you can throw, eat and crush an apple; or you can shoot people with guns,...\n\nSimilar to real life, each item has limited use. \n\n&gt;If you eat a banana, you loses it. \n&gt;If you launch your car into the sea, you also lose it.\n&gt;If you uses your vehicle too much and it runs out of fuel, you have to buy fuel for it.\n\nThe stranger you use your item, the more points you will be rewarded.\n\n&gt;For example, you have an apple. If you eat it, you will be rewarded 1 point. However, if you throw this apple, and it somehow blocks a bullet on its way, you will be awarded 10 points. You are even awarded more points if that saves a victim from being killed.\n\n&gt;Another example is a car. If you normally drive it, you are awarded 1 point each time. However, if you use that car to crash into a nuclear factory (which makes it explode and kill all people in that city), you are freaking awarded with 10 points.\n\nThere will be events that occur occassionally in the game. This help you to earn more points.\n\n&gt;For example, a bank robbery, or aliens invading the earth, or a flock of chickens can lay exploding eggs,...\n\n\n--------------------------------\n\nThis is a quite complicating game to make, as there are so many interactions. Of course all activites in this game is for fun only.\n\nPlease let me know what you guys think. Thanks a lot."
mwxz0j,A platformer where abilities are the key to success,"the game will follow a robot superhero named gadget kid, which will use various gadgets to his advantage. The game will begin with a scientist creating gadget kid, and you will go through a tutorial set in the scientist’s lab, where you will get your first gadget, which will be a super jump ability. After you complete the tutorial, you will be given access to the research lab, where you can spend coin to upgrade or get new abilities, or “gadgets”, as they will be called in game. Coins can be collected from the levels. You can upgrade the super jump to have a shorter cooldown or a higher jump, but that dash ability sure looks nice, doesn’t it? Or if you save up your coins, and you can get that teleport ability. Each level have more than one way to beat it. super jump up one section, or use the dash ability to cross a gap and access another way to reach the goal. you start up with only one gadget slot, and while you can purchase more, it caps out at 3. In terms of story, i haven’t got far yet, but there will be 6 sections, with around 10 levels in each, with each section having its own gimmick. A space station with lower gravity. An arctic hideout with slippery ice physics. And the dangers, you know them all. Buzzsaws, lasers, moving platforms, spikes, missiles, and mooks galore. Some levels may require certain gadgets to finish, but they might not since i would think that speed runners would try to do a default gadget run. There will probably be cameos from other indies games, each with their own abilities. Like meat boy from super meat boy, which will have better mobility than the default characters, or frisk from undertake, who have the ability to turn into a soul. What do you think?\n\nGadgets that i thought of:\n\nSuper jump: go vertically a great distance\n\ndash: dash forward, ignoring gravity \n\npunch: go forward a short distance, damaging mooks and breaking breakable blocks.\n\ngravity switch: switches your gravity so you would stand on the ceiling.\n\nRewind: rewind all moving object to their position a certain amount of time ago.\n\nBlast force: creates a pulse around you which will knock back all mooks around you\n\nundetectable: turn yourself invisible for a certain amount of time, rendering enemies unable to see you\n\nfast forward:  make your movement speed faster for a set amount of time\n\nDive: when activated, makes you dive to the ground, damaging any enemies in the way and breaking breakable blocks.\n\nShrink: turn yourself 1/2 of your size for a set amount of time, making you faster and be able to go through smaller passages, but you jump lower while small.\n\nteleport: make yourself move forward a set amount of distance, ignoring any hazard in the way.\n\nsticky hands: allows you to climb up a wall. Will keep climbing until you take damage, the wall ends, or if you hit the ceiling.\n\nTime freeze: freezes time for a set amount of time, which will freeze any moving objects in place.\n\ndeflector shield: protects you from all dangers for a set amount of time.\n\nhover: when activated, you now fall slowly when you fall."
mwxxdm,A farming + hack and slash game,Classic stardew valley kinda thing in terms of farming but the twist is that if you don't harvest your plants in time (probably like 4 or 5 real time days) they turn into the monsters you have to fight. The longer you leave them to fight the more boss-ish they become. This by itself is not a fully fledged game idea but you could combine it with some other really cool ideas I have seen. For example you run a restaurant and you have to feed some customers and others you have to poison ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/hvbnss/nondetailed_list_of_half_baked_ideas/)) or perhaps you take the restaurant and make it like elheber's idea ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/g5a71e/a_2d_fantasy_game_in_which_you_cook_and_invent/)). But this would be cool if combined with other game ideas I've found on here.

mwvp9k,A town / city-sized public transport tycoon game,"I love tycoon games, from the old classics like Sim City and Transport Tycoon to the newer indie ones all around Steam.\n\nBut one sub-genre of it that I have always been missing was a game about public transport.\n\nIt would not be like Transport Tycoon (and all it's newer brothers and sisters out there) since you would be limited to just one town or city and you would not have control over regional trains or airports, shipyards etc. because they are run by the state and not the city.\n\nIt would also not be like Sim City, Cities Skylines and so on because you would not have any control over city planning. The quality of your public transport lines would have an effect on areas of the town though (commuters getting to their jobs or not, areas with bad public transport being less desirable etc.)\n\nYou would have to consider changes the city makes – like building a new high school or a new neighborhood with lots of new apartments, making sure these are well connected to the public transport system. Or developments ""from outside"", like a new high speed train connection that requires you to upgrade your lines to the train station due to more passengers arriving / going there.\n\nA first tutorial scenario could be a small town in the 1960s, where buses where the main means of public transportation. You have limited budget and have to plan your 3-4 first lines wisely. There would be a simulation mode, where you can plan the stops and lines in detail without building them. The tutorial teaches you, that you have control over the lines' schedules – the game would output the arrival times for your chosen routes for all the stations and you have control over ""waiting times"" in stations or mandatory breaks at the end of the line to control the lines' schedule. The game then makes you plan a line that correlates well with the hourly arrival time of a regional train at the town's train station.\n\nLater you will move on to bigger or more complex cities. Like a European Capital around the year 1900, where busses didn't exist but streetcars did. Or a well developed city in the year 1980 that grows so fast it finally needs its first metro lines. There could also be more unusual things like funiculars, aerial cable cars or boats (thinking of Venice here).\n\nInvestments in streetcars or especially metro lines are VERY expensive and the metro tunnels would not appear the second you build them. There would be construction sites for years that negatively affect (public) transport in the streets and therefore your existing bus or streetcar lines. Getting rid of a poorly planned metro line is basically impossible, you can just close it but the tunnel would stay there and be sunk costs.\n\nI'm curious about what you guys think!"

mwlgec,A casual game idea about monster transformation.,"Hi guys. I'm just thinking about a casual online game, which could be on Mobile or Web - based. \n\nUnfortunately I don't know anything about graphics and game design, so it's just an idea. I did try to implement it on Java, but it looks weird without the graphics. (*Insert sad face*).\n\nSo, please let me know what you guys think.\n\n\n#CONCEPT:\n\nThis *casual* game sets up in a map (a city, a festival,...), with 4 - 7 players each game. One or two of them (depends on the number of players) will be chosen randomly to be the **Guardians**. The rest will be the **Mutated**.\n\nThe **Mutated** win if they can defeat all the Guardians in a set of time. Whoever deals the most damage to the Guardians is the MVP, and take the highest rewards. In contrast, the **Guardians** wins at least 1 of them still survive after the time runs out.\n\n#IN - DEPTH:\n\nThe map is filled with numerous bots (can be human, animals..., depends on the theme) that wanders around. At first, both the **Mutated** and the *Guardians** blend into these bots, sharing the same appearance as one of them.\n\nThe **Mutated** can consume the bots to charge up their *Energy Gauge*. However, if they mistakenly consume the **Guardians**, they will be killed instantly. They will be respawned later, but 50% of their **Energy Gauge** will be depleted.\n\nWhen their *Energy Gauge* is full, they can reveal themselves and transform  into a monster of their choice (welp, with gigantic appearance). Each monster have a different set of abilities.\n\nFor the **Guardians**, after a certain of time passes (may be 2 mins, 3 mins,...), or when at least 1 **Mutated** has transformed; they also has the ability to transform into the **Guardians** of their choice. They also have their own set of skills.\n\nIf a transformed monster or guardian is defeated, it will not respawn. Transformed guardian can still hit non - transformed **Mutated**, but will not deplete their *Energy Gauge* anymore.\n\n**Guardian**'s strength is based on the number of **Mutated** players.\n\nWhen not transformed, both the **Mutated** and the **Guardians** have 1 special ability (of their choice) to help them with the process.\n\n---------------------------\n\n**Thank you very much for reading my post ! Please let me know what you think.**"
mwdqlb,Control a cursor with a gamepad - Using both sticks,"I may have posted this before but couldn't find it.   \n\nMy idea is to use both sticks of a typical gamepad to simultaneously control mouse cursor position.   I have made a simple prototype in Unreal Engine to see how it feels, and it works nicely for finer control of the cursor using an Xbox controller.   Any dual stick controller should benefit from this. \n\nBasically, both sticks are setup as mouse-region style control.  One stick controls a mouse region which has a centerpoint at the center of the display.   Tilting the stick will move the cursor in that direction up to 2/3 of the way to the edge of the screen.   The region itself is a horizontal oval, or setup however the display is oriented.   \n\n The other stick is also a mouse region, but it's centerpoint changes based on the position of the other stick.    \n\nWhat I found by making a prototype is that it is much easier to quickly navigate the desktop and precisely click.    Having two regions makes the control of the cursor precise enough so that potentially you would not need to develop a second interface for PC/Console."

mwagz8,A reverse Metroidvania Metroid game,"A metroidvania is a game genre, usually 2d platformer, where the player can freely roam back and forth to any rooms of the map and is usually required to do so to accomplish objectives to progress the game or acquire upgrades. Although recent metroidvanias have areas gated with upgrade prerequisites, the game is structured such that those areas are technically accessible if the player is stubborn and creative enough to exploit certain game mechanics that would allow them to reach those areas even without the required upgrades.\n\nPopular metroidvanias include metroid games and castlevania games such as Aria of Sorrow, Symphony of the Night, Super Metroid, and Metroid Fusion.\n\nThe reverse of this would imply that the game structure follows the original NES Castlevania game structure: A sidescroller, level-and-stage-based game.\n\nWhile metroidvanias are usually non-linear, classic NES sidescrollers are explicitly linear to the effect that the player cannot go back to access previous stages/rooms, but has a clear route presented ahead of them. It is for this reason that they typically don't have upgrades that are accessible only to one part of the game. Instead, the level design shifts the focus on what's already in front of the player, and upgrades are usually temporary/can be lost, but regained by pressing on with the game.\n\nObv example is NES Castlevania, but also NES Ninja Gaiden.\n\nSo anyway, yeah... A sidescroller platformer shooter with more focus on micro-plays and faster-pace action. The focus of level design are enemy placements and platforming.

mw5gjd,Awesome video game concept,"Ok so This is up for grabs for whoever wants it but I want credit for the idea, I thought of a cool concept where you are playing a character in an adventure game (3rd person view) and the character goes on these adventures thinking everything is normal, then throughout the story the character you are playing becomes aware of u and starts to fight over control of their body, and eventually there will be a part in the game where u sometimes lose control of the character and they do whatever they want, how I thought about it is it being a story driven game where u can do side quests and stuff like that but the character takes control whenever they want to and will be random or maybe one of u can come up with something better, again it’s a concept, I find it to be a unique idea and if anyone wants to make that into a full fledged game please make sure to give me some credit for the idea my Instagram is dorman1969"

mw3j9q,A game about exploring your curiosity,"You play a scientist researching the properties of some sort of anomalous object; one-sided paper, a gun that makes things ""better"", tape that fixes things based on some perceived flaw. These are just examples.\n\nThe main gameplay loop would revolve around completing objectives with the object, such as seeing how it interacts with fire or whether a gun can hurt it. Some of the objectives would be hidden, such as having a fuse box fritz out while it's covered in water, revealing how it interacts with electricity.\n\nMaybe you'd even get enough ranks to experiment with two anamolous objects at once."

mvu7zn,Smash Melee-style platform fighter with MMO mechanics.,Seems rather self-explanatory.  Take the combo complexity and fluid motion of Smash Melee and create large inter-linking maps that can allow people to travel all around the world fighting both PvP and PrE scenarios.\n\nRather than a diverse roster of fighters you focus more on very limited starting character builds with diversity through the tech tree.  Picking up different abilities and stat modifiers and cosmetics as you travel through the world.  Your character being more like Fox or Pikachu comes down to decisions you make in your build rather than outright character selection.\n\nThe PvP aspect is the least difficult to grasp as that's what Melee is at its core.  But PvE dungeons and raids could be incredible in a platform fighter so long as the mechanics and dungeon design is constructed to accommodate the style of game.
mvtfdn,I Don't Deserve You: A non-horror game where you talk to your adorable girlfriend and nothing bad happens &lt;3,"This idea was pretty spontaneous, so it's kinda rough. Also it's supposed to be pixilated.\n\n**Title:** I Don't Deserve You\n\nYou're talking to your Girlfriend online, you've been so much happier ever since she came into your life, your Depression has been much more manageable since then. This is all you've ever wanted, you should be happy but... the darkness still lingers in the back of your mind, it draws ever closer when she's offline, talking to her helps but... it only delays the feeling.\n\nShe lives too far to visit, you can't be there for her like you should be, you're holding her back from people so much better than you, people that can give her the real love and affection she deserves. She's so wholesome and loving and you are too... but that feeling of inadequacy and guilt still weighs you down.\n\nThe darkness closes in and whispers to you:\n\n*You don't deserve her... You never did... You can't even clean the dishes, much less give her what she needs... You're pathetic...""\n\nSomething starts to claw at your back.\n\n*Ding!*\n\nA new message, thank god. The darkness subsides, only lingering in the dark corners of the room.\n\n**Gameplay:**\n\nThere are two distinct parts of gameplay; Online, Talking to your Girlfriend, and Offline, where you push back the shadows closing in and attempt to tidy up your house.\n\nOnline: You talk to your adorable, wholesome, girlfriend which raises your Sanity, and have multiple dialogue options to chose from. She talkz with ""Hewwoz"" and ""Wuvvz"" and all of the cute talkz you love about her, and many of your dialogue options reflect this, showing the same cutesy, playful tone. \n\nIf your sanity is low, disturbing dialogue options will appear, hallucinations will occur, and certain events leading to death occur as well.\n\nDifferent options can lead to different endings, one of which, the true ending, telling her about your feelings and inadequacy leading her to comfort you and tell you  everything is okay (as usual) and her coming to visit you, pusing the darkness away completely. Disturbing dialogue options cause her to break up with you for quite obvious reasons, leading to the bad ending.\n\nAlso, on very rare occasions (like 1/10,000) she'll suggest talking about *things* 😏 (the entire dialogue boxes and options are blurred out and goes extremely quickly) which wastes entire hours of in-game time, but completely fills your sanity and gives some temporary extra sanity. Also a cute, temporary blush effect on the player sprite.\n\nOffline:\n\nOffline is where the real meat of the game is and where the horror begins. Dark, whispering shadows close in on the player, draining sanity, and the only way to stop this is to get to some source of light. Your computer screen only slows sanity drain, while things like the kitchen light stop it completely, and talking to your Girlfriend stops drain and raises sanity.\n\nYour goal while offline is to simply clean the house, nothing too hard, right?\n\nThe shadows become more aggressive the more the night drags on and at a certain point, your Girlfriend goes to sleep for the night, meaning no more Sanity for you! Well, playing games on the computer raises your sanity but at a much slower rate meaning you're not *completely* doomed, but things can also sneak up on you while you're not looking...\n\nCertain shadows have distinct designs and scare the player in different ways, including one that very closely resembles the player.\n\nA lot of the scares and chases are up to the person that (maybe) develops this, but the final chase is one that I have envisioned and would like to see in the game.\n\nThe shadowy doppelganger follows you onto the stairs that usually lead from your bedroom to the kitchen, but when you go into the next room, it's just more stairs. The shadow suddenly rushes the player, chasing them down infinite sets of stairs. The stairs change, turn different directions, the pictures on the wall smile at you and become bloody, the shadow morphs into a wretched lumbering beast and rages towards you. There is another ending that can be gotten during this chase if it catches you, static flashes on screen, the player character trips down the stairs and stops moving...\n\nIf you escape, the other endings apply.\n\nAnyway, thank you for listening to my Idea! I hope someone here can make it a reality!"
mvsocc,A STEM game niche yet to be made?,"I Have a engineering/STEM need to be filled and can only pick up so many rocks and sticks and build a stone tool over and over in survival games before its gets super old.. I do not want to build stick huts over and over from the stone age to work up to building cool things. Also on the flip side.. survival space games are also getting old. I like building higher tech stuff, but those games have to focus so much it seems in getting all the space mechanics and world stuff down that a lot of potential is taken away from building the STEM(science technology engineering and mathematics) heavy side of things.\n\nI am thinking it would be cool for an engineering game that skips the stupid basics and gets into the heavier stuff from the get-go. Say perhaps you are on a resource filled world with real world elements from the periodic table of elements. and you start with one high-tech miner/builder device that lets you mine some elements and craft basics machines then to make bigger machines that eventually leads to Robots,Mech suits, Aircraft/ Airships. To make it challenging have an enemy AI also doing the same things so it gives you engaging game play to defend your mad scientist base building. This is just a quick thought and I'm sure this can be refined with more thought/discussion.\n\nI hope I am not the only one out there wanting a heavier STEM niche filled and maybe one day one will be developed! What do you all think?"

mvn7dl,Dungeon Master Sim + Out of Character Visual Novel,"Two-Mode narrative game flipping between a simple Dungeon Master simulator where characters take actions based on how you lay out the dungeon, and a visual novel of players before and after the session. The actions the characters take in game reflect their out-of-character personality and the encounters you put them through affect their out-of-character behaviour. Kind of inspired by Cibele's simple gameplay to motivate a story.\n\nBased on an experience playing D&amp;D where two characters were having a spat before the session. Everything was smooth, but then the tiefling started quarterbacking and trying to take the spotlight, and the other character got upset and waterboarded them. They tried to play it off as in-character, but then they got up and left mid-session and the waterboarder cleric quit the party.\n\n**DM Mode**: Likely simple interactions to avoid needing to engage a narrative player in strong tactical play for half the game. Ideally, party members have simple stats that reflect the kinds of encounters they'll engage in, but everything is grounded in social mechanics. How engaged are they? How upset? How aggressive? Are they feeling contrarian to one party member, or maybe overly attached? They face simple encounters, and the player tries to keep them entertained. Maybe the DM can drag enemies and loot into the rooms and the ""ideal"" gameplay is to manage pacing and reward distribution.\n\n**Relationship**: Basically a standard visual novel, but the choices are few and far between and the branching is largely handled by what happened in game. Maybe they party wiped, and one player felt contrarian (predetermined in the narrative) and blames another, ending a friendship. Maybe the DM let two close friends engage in encounters together, and they get romantically involved by next session. \n\nI really like the idea of this playing out over many sessions with time skips to show the long-term effects of the session interactions; years go by, party members change, sessions go from immature o we the top Mary Sue murder-hobo adventures to calmer, more grounded social adventures. My first iteration of the story started in highschool and moved on to when everyone was married with kids/working full time jobs and thinking about ""the old days"", but obviously there's tons of room for interesting narratives here!\n\nLove to hear thoughts!"

mvk627,Polybious-inspired Horror Game,"Basically, you rent a diner/motel across the street if an arcade that supposedly has unreleased rumored arcade games. These games send entities after you as hallucinations while you play and follow you back to the motel.\nGameplay would be similar to Fnaf. You play the arcade game but every now and then you gotta turn away to drink water, turn the lights back on, or go to the bathroom. Sound cues will indicate that a hallucination is close by and you have to prevent them from messing you up. They could turn off the light down the hall, take your drink, or directly approach you. Once you finish the game, you can talk to npcs in visual novel esque segments.\nThe night segments will have you fend them off in your room. They will try to break in from the window, sneak through the vents, crawl out of the bed, or turn the water on to get through."

mves6z,ProBoard X - is a longboarding cursing/racing vr game for pc.,"This ideas kinda in early development but the idea came to me whilst watching raw runs on a long boarders YouTube channel and though, you know this'd make a great base for a game! if any of the ideas shown below help you in any way im happy!\n\nMore details for the game down below.  \n\n\n**Specialized cruise races:**\n\nThe game Would come with 6 races/cruise tracks, ranging in environments like:\n\n* French alps   \n* Grand Canyon \n* Bavarian Alps, Germany\n* Nanortalik, Greenland\n* Central London\n* Australian outback \n* Utah desert\n\n These maps would range in distance, elevation size of road, off road, underground and maybe include little shortcut jumps and wait spots for vehicles/destructible environments.\n\n**OpenWorld System**\n\nWhilst including races, preboard would also include an open world map which players could access and cruise around for as long as they want. This map would include a sea section, mountainous terrain, abandoned city and plenty of small avenues/mini roads that go under the ground which u can go in. In order go up hill you'd have 4 options:\n\n* Board Push (allows you to gain momentum by your character pushing the board forwards)\n* General Teleport (a teleport system which allows you to instantly go back to some general hotspots or anywhere you’ve deployed a teleport beacon)\n* Car Tailing (a custom car would be generated that you can hold onto the back of to gain momentum which then you could let go of at speed or stay attached to for up climbs)\n* Electric longboard (this would replace your board and would allow you to gain speed and long board uphill's too)\n* Your character would have a zip pack on them that would contain flares inside, allowing you to setup your own races in the open world which you can then race with friends.\n\n**Escape Mode**\n\nInstead of racing to something you're now racing away. This game mode would be players getting to freedom from the environment, racing away from things like:\n\n* Floods\n* Avalanches\n* Sandstorms\n* Fire\n* A nuclear bomb\n* Army cars shooting your way.\n* Ice (longboarding on top of ice which is falling apart)\n\nThese races would be about survival and not time or competition.\n\n**Custom Map Creation Tool with workshop support:**\n\nThis would allow players to create their own custom races and upload them to game, allowing people to race against each other on them or just cruse around depending on whether the map Is open world or streamlined for a race.\n\n**Custom Theatre Mode:**\n\nThis mode would contain a free cam mode that would allow u to survey and playback your past races so you can see where u went wrong. This free cam mode would be able to go at different speeds and would have different viewpoints. These would include:\n\n* POV (Go Pro Cam which would reside on the players head) \n* FreeHand (generates a physical camera in game that u as a player can hold and get custom shots with)\n* LineCam/Race Cam Track (would allow you to draw your own custom line in game which once completed would then act like a track which the camera would follow.)\n* Car Cam (A third person camera from behind as if a car was following you through the track)\n\n**Long Board/Armour Customization:**\n\nThese would be cosmetics that you could buy from the store and ones you could unlock from doing time trials.\n\n**Character:**\n\n* Basic clothing\n* Gloves \n* Helmets\n* Zip bags\n\n**Longboard:**\n\n* Trucks\n* Wheels\n* Decks\n* Grip tape\n\n**Specials:**\n\n* Gloves (gloves have special abilities where u can make sparks come out of them when grinding the ground) (Skins)\n* Flares (that you can throw that make fireworks. Or use at the end of a finish line)\n\n**Dynamic leaning control scheme.**\n\nThis games long board mode we be keyed as follows:\n\n* Board Pushing (Trigger)\n* Menu (Holding down y or x for a duration of time)\n* Power sliding (requires you to bend down, lean in banking direction and then HOLD A for extended duration of power slide)\n* Board Hold (requires you to bend down, putting your controllers to the board whilst HOLDING GRIP on both hands to grab it)\n* Accelerating (requires you to bend slightly and bring your hands to your sides)\n* Grinding (requires you to bend down and put your hand out onto the ground, which will intern grind with the ground and slow u down)"

mvb8a5,Stealth Game from the Perspective of a Guard,"Ever wonder what the grunt guards in Assassin's Creed or Arkham Asylum are thinking? What is it like to have an unseen entity constantly toy with you for hours on end? In this game you play as a nightguard, protecting a rare (and valuable) diamond in a museum. \n\nA stealthy thief is trying to steal the diamond for himself, and he has very creative ways of messing with you, such as tranquilizer darts that make you slower, or shadow-casting that makes you think you're seeing him. However, you can set traps too, like a bear trap, or cutting off his favorite exits, or spilling some oil so he'll slip. You can also shoot paintballs at him to follow his trail. Once you finally get close enough to him, you can bash him with your nightstick! The game is a constant back and forth between the night guard and the thief until one of them dies, the diamond is captured, or the timer runs out."

mv9gql,Everywhere At The End Of Time game," Imagine a game set to the song Everywhere At The End Of Time by the Caretaker. No pausing, no saving or quitting, just the entire 6 hour game in one sitting. It starts simple, you got some tasks to do, put away some items, water plants, clean the floor, etc. Every task is replaced with a new one in each day cycle of 10 minutes with light outside being your only time indicator.  After a while, you notice something. Sometimes tasks disappear, the days seem to be shorter. Tasks you swore you've done are suddenly back on your task board. But don't worry about it. It's probably nothing.....was your bed always red? More tasks reappear and disappear, days only seem to last 5 minutes now, items you need for your task aren't in the same place you left them, the rooms in your house change, what's going on? It's getting worse, days, tasks, item, your own house. Days last seconds, task disappear just as quickly as they appear. You move forward, you're in the bathroom? Kitchen? You can't tell, everything is unfamiliar. Finally, there are no more tasks, no more day cycles, everything is a flat grey, your controls seem random, everything you knew is unfamiliar, it's gone...... Things slowly fade, first the colour grey, then the empty taskbar, and piece by piece you slowly fade away. As the final notes of the song play, you lose the ability to do anything in the game as the final minute of silence plays..."

This virus affects robots by injecting malicious code into its brain. we are one of the few survivors like in most of the game of this kind :)\n\nOur exceptional agility and great stealth skills makes us powerful and un-infected in this dangerous world. we can achieve things no one else can. Enter places no one else dares.\n\nThis virus was created by a robot himself to make robots in control of him. **Infected robots are programmed to search un-infected robots and inject malicious code into them while prisoning the un-infected robots who are going to be infected**. If they find us we will be infected and we will lose. \n\nSome robots including our family are un-infected but they are in their prison or something. They're going to be infected\n\nThere are objects in levels which can be used for distracting them. We can destroy light to be unnoticed in the dark. We can throw smoke granades to disfunction infected robot's cameras(eyes)\n\nThere are other features. I can't tell (spoiler)\n\nThere will be missions.. like reach there.. do that..\n\n**Our main objectives: Stealthly move without them noticing. distract them. Dis-infect the infected. Sneak and come from behind of infected robots and remove the malicious code from their system.** If all malicious code are erased they will shutdown and will be dis-infected then we can save other robots.\n\nAt last we will reach a center or system which controls all the codes of the robots. We'll reach that and enter the good code and publish that. that code will reach all the shut downed robots and they will work normally as before
mv8kb2,idfk what it’s called yet i thought of it today,"yo i just thought of a sick ass idea for a game. tell me if this is something y’all would play and comment with some feedback if you want to.\n\nso basically the entire world got frozen over because some lab accidentally released some kind of thing, idk if it’s an animal or some kinda technology yet. humanity had to go underground to survive, but the main character did something bad in the bunker, so he/she got exiled from the bunker. you start off with nothing but underwear so you gotta start walking. if you don’t find shelter fast enough you die and that’s the secret ending, (you can see the shelter in the distance so people have to consciously afk to get the ending) as you’re about to reach the shelter the ground collapses and you fall into an underground lab made by the same people who caused it in the first place. it’s an experiment room so you enter some kinda chamber and you gain the ability to revive yourself when you die. you also find climbing gear. once you climb back outta the hole you get to the shelter and find some socks in there which give you a bit more health/cold resistance. you then are set off to explore a big frozen open world with abandoned cities and a bunch of other stuff. it’s gonna be similar to a metroidvania where you need certain abilities to unlock new parts of the map. also, you get superpowers by finding more of those labs. and you also find your own bunker which’ll be a multiplayer hub. and you find each piece of clothing and you can upgrade it to multiple tiers, each of which will be visible on your character. i’m tired af so i’m prolly missing a lot of stuff so comment and i’ll try to answer any questions about it.\n\nOH there are also monsters that’ll give you materials and it’s gonna be third person with realistic graphics. i’m starting to learn unity and c# now so it’s prolly gonna be a couple years."
mv0p5r,"Looking to make this game, need some extra ideas! Movement-based third person shooter","I’m looking to make this game, but I’d like any additional ideas anyone has.  The game would be a movement based PVP third person shooter.  Basically, each map will encourage constant movement and create engagements everywhere.  Players can jump and slide, and certain lanes of the map will force them to do so.  For example, there may be an overhead pipe or road block which the player must slide under or jump over to cross.  Some ideas I had for maps were the back alleys of a city, a sewage system, several rooftops connected via bridges, and an enclosed arena.  Weapons would be pretty realistic, including some iconic guns such as the M16 or AK47, but humorous weapons are not out of the question.  The art style would be very colorful with low poly graphics.     As for the intended platform, I’d love to get this game on Xbox.  The concept seems great for the platform, and their ID@Xbox program makes Indie development seemingly easy.  I have yet to come up with a name, but if anybody has an idea for one, or for any other features please let me know.  In addition, would you play this game?  Thank you all in advance."

mux06z,Just a mechanic concept,"It just popped into my head. But has anyone ever seen a game mechanic where travel is based on in-game days? Like you choose to move an army to a separate location but travel will take 5 in-game days. But the twist is you’d have too properly prepare for the journey, say it’s a five day trip but you could rush your army and complete the trip in 3 days but the army arrives exhausted and needs to rest. Maybe if you also under-supply the army the journey could take longer or complete it in time but lose moral or lose a small amount of soldiers due to hunger. Or lower their pack load by not properly arming them for the journey, complete the trip quicker, and arm themselves at their designated location. Anything like this exist or is it even a good idea? I think Total War has something kinda like this."

muujty,Why aren’t there any Giant Monster Battling Games?,"I am on the new side of developing video games, but one idea that has been stuck in my head is an updated monster fighting game. Think about the 2004 “Godzilla: Save the Earth” or even the 2003 “War of the Monsters” but 2021 edition. I am not entirely sure if there is just not a big enough audience for these types of games or if these types of games were just left in the 2000s for no particular reason. I feel if the combat is done right, and the environment truly is responsive to the massive fight taking place this game can not only be a fun and immersive game to play with friends, but could even include versions of ranked play for the more competitive. What’s great about big monster battling games is no one really cares about the story. For example, look at the new King Kong versus Godzilla movie. People (myself included) didn’t care much for the story telling (and let’s be real it was was not that great), but rather they just wanted to see two huge monsters clash it out on the big screen. It would be no different with a video game. You could even incorporate multiple game modes 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, free-for-all, and the list goes on. Obviously this is more of a question than an idea, but let me know what y’all think and if this would be something you would consider playing. Feel free to even give me ideas, because I would love for this idea to be my first big game project I attempt to create. Thanks!"
murssd,Anyone wanna help make a FPS game?,"I posted earlier on my game backstory and I have 2 journals full of game ideas and my game I wanna make that’s an FPS game. I don’t have money to pay people it’s just for fun the game Is like destiny 2 and it has you travel from planet to planet collecting data and weapons. I have many people who love my idea and wish it was a game rn. I need people to help create it. We can do a google meet with everyone and work in groups on this game. Just so you know at the moment I’m 17 and will be 18 in 30 something days. I need someone who can 3d model characters and weapons, someone who is good with using unreal engine (not unity), someone who can animate characters and create cool particle effects, and someone who can create buildings through blender and terrain through unreal engine. If you are interested in doing this send me a chat. Remember you won’t get paid but I will credit you in the game and you can even get your own custom character in the game if you want along with a custom weapon. Plz consider joining the development of this game. \n\n-darkassasin390(assassin is spelled wrong on purpose)"

n2ptfl,Dominus,"Does anyone remember the 4v1 asymmetrical game ""[Evolve](https://2k.com/en-US/game/evolve/)"" (2015)?\n\nSo imagine that but in a battle royale-like genre, with a deteriorating map/atmosphere. where players play as monsters/creatures who have to survive, consuming NPC flora/fauna (depending on the selected creatures diet) to generate health and shield/armour while filling up their evolve meter. But killing other players unique creatures to gain additional evolve meter progression and mutations/abilities that they acquire after consuming them, which become accessible after evolving. (I imagine this would work similar to **Evolves** 3-stage evolution cycle.)\n\nProbably releasing with a solo mode first and then a trios - ""Herd/Pack"" mode."
n2kauo,Mobile AR (Pokemon Go style) Domination Game. Here me out,"If this has already been done, I'd appreciate it if you'd let me know the name. The game is basically an AR platform that simulates the real world, human nature desire to conquer and dominate. The premise is that you as a player can claim any amount of land that you can outline by walking in real life (using gps tech of course). This would simulate how land used to be claimed in old world city states. There would be various resources that are more prevalent in some areas and scarce in others (common resources would be like wood so all players can build). The game would have features that allow players, if they want to, to engage in diplomacy. That's about as far as I've got in terms of a concrete concept. A few ideas for some features are as follows. The player controls their own population of virtual people. This is how there could be wars and limitations to people's power (so that everyone can at least stand a fighting chance). Because trade is so natural to human nature, it can be purely between players so that people don't have to worry about paying to build structures. That way it all depends on resources, which would premote expansion of land. These resources would then be used to for not only personal use but trade between players. ""I own land that produces alot of oil and you own land that produces alot of metals. Lets make a deal"" sort of thing. Building structures is the more difficult thing to work out. So when designing a game like this I believe it best to decide first what players need and then make buildings that allow for that specific thing to be accomplished on the inner state level. I'm not a game designer or anything but I would love to collaborate with someone who maybe wants to build something like this (if it hasn't already been made of course). Thanks"
n2hi6d,How do I organize an open world 3d-platformer?,I am thinking up ideas for an open world 3d platformer in the style of super mario odyssey. I wanted to organize the game’s worlds in a style similar to Super Mario Odyssey’s “all kingdoms in one level mod” https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=pXFlO7JzRCU. But I don’t know how to handle progression. I was thinking of a dense fog that would cover “locked” worlds that would only subsist when you collected the necessary quantity of the core collectible in order to “unlock” the world.  But something seems off with this approach. How would YOU handle progression in a game like this? What do you think?
n2ebhh,Using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing to render more convincingly human NPCs,"Natural language processing can produce dynamic conversation (speech to text allows user speech as input and outputs the chatbots text into vocalized responses)\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3\n\nThis allows NPCs to have a far greater degree of interactivity with the player.  This can be even further maximized if we parse body language using neural nets set on motion matching with a broad framework of dialogue and conversational mocap to blend and draw from.  Body language is dynamically responsive in life and those cues can inform our responses, feeding enough data into the black box used, and the neural net can approximate the output that sync most naturally into the conversation.  \n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=o-QLSjSSyVk\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Mnu1DzFzRWs\n\nFacial expressions can be mapped to conversational cues and matching lip movement organically, neural nets let AI video bots already mimic human speech fairly accurately.  \n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=PqbB07n_uQ4\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=CaZzXqYyR94\n\nProcedurally generated ontological mental models can inform the internal workings of characters and their understanding of, and relations to, the world around them.  You can vectorize this character knowledge in order to run nearest neighbor regression neutral network behavioral analysis, and use machine learning to dictate how NPCs respond, while simplifying the memory load.  \n\nhttp://www.gameaipro.com/GameAIPro3/GameAIPro3_Chapter37_Simulating_Character_Knowledge_Phenomena_in_Talk_of_the_Town.pdf\n\nDelay likely because of having to run NLU and parse then produce responses can make conversation awkward- conceptually, could this be “faked” by using a translator effect, explaining away the delay due to having your speech translated for the NPCs passively and it being done when they speak in return.  This could also help mask some of the stilted dialogue from the bot generated text, as it could have that “lost in translation” handwave available.  \n\nIf the constraints of processing and producing so many effects can’t be reduced enough to have a minor delay like a translator, one could also use a sci-fi conceit like communicating over great distances in staccato messages Ping-ponging back and forth with a somewhat more significant delay.  This has been used to great effect in media like Interstellar or Voices From a Distant Star, messages could still be 3D, always look for a good chance to break out a Starwars style holoprojector.\n\nCould possibly examine what story conceits might lead to this fish out of water situation, and it could give us an interesting perspective to approach from as an outsider to a culture.  However much you hide processing in the background to buy baking time, you can ultimately offer a more dynamic and interactive character system which can much better sell the immersion of conversation.  \n\n**TL;DR** \n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=CBrj4S24074"
n2e893,Abandoned railway game idea,"I've always liked abandoned railways/train depots have watched a lot of videos about it aswell and I decided to take a look if there were any games about that sort of thing. I couldn't find any unfortunately so I came up with a concept of some sorts. \nSo what I had in mind is that it will be a sort of infinite world type of game.  Now the terrain it will generate are abandoned railways, train depots, some tunnels, abandoned trains and some areas around it for example deep in a forest to give it that extra abandoned look. Maybe you can use a car or another vehicle to cover the distances between stations/depots if walking is too slow. There would be no health system or anything you wouldn't have to build certain things etc it would just be a cinematic game. The reason why I would absolutely love a game like that is because as I said before I watched a lot of videos about those things and sadly there aren't any abandoned railways near where I live. I have absolutely no idea if what I said is even possible but I would love a game like that\nSorry if my English isn't the best it's not my native language"

n29ntf,Random items on fps multiplayer gamss,"Hi guys! My friend has been complaining that the competition in the fps genre is increasing and... You know, he kinda sucks. He says, he's more of a casual players and loves fps genre and plays it for fun. According to him he don't want to be a pro player and just try to get fun but the games creates a large skill gap in multiplayer and he keeps getting killed. \n\nI have been playing mario Kart lately and I analyse that how it overcomes the large skill gap. It gives random items based on the position to help nubs to compete with skilled ones. \n\nHow about we implemented such system in fps games? I mean you will get random items every 3-4 minutes depending on the kill to death ratio. The lower your kills will be, the more powerful item you will get. This will help nubs to compete but they can't rely on it and have to develop skills to use them and play. It will also increase competition for the pro players. Also there has been a lack of creativity I  modern fps games. \n\nIt's just an idea. What you guys think? \n\n(Sorry for the grammatical mistakes, English is not my native language)"

The game is going to be a 5v5 capture the point type game mode but the main gimmick is that it's going to be 2D with both platform fighting and moba game play thrown in. As for the lore, the idea is that the gods are hosting these competitions to see if they can find a mortal worthy to become a god which lures a lot of interesting people which will be the different characters called challengers.

n1jsa6,"Grand Theft Auto meets Postal 2, set in post-soviet Russia","Take the presentation and control style of Grand Theft Auto 3 (sorry, that's the latest one I've played so I can't refer to the later editions), but put it in a setting that's essentially everything from /r/ANormalDayInRussia and gopnik meme videos at over-the-top levels. Content features include:\n\n- The car roster consists mostly of Lada Rivas, military vehicles, off-road trucks, construction machinery, and randomly modded 'frankencars' (e.g. with skis in place of wheels, furniture duct-taped on the roof, etc).\n- You can cut up vehicles with a welding torch and reattach pieces to make your own frankencars.\n- You can find rocket launch pads with Soyuz rockets on them and hijack the rockets just like you hijack any other vehicle. The rockets are very touchy to control, and tend to explode when they crash, unless you can fly them long enough to run out of fuel.\n- Trucks full of cargo, which can spill if the truck gets damaged. This can result in e.g. hundreds of vodka bottles being strewn across the street, or hordes of livestock being released and running rampant, to generate amusing situations.\n- Lots of low-friction snow to drift vehicles on.\n- Ice-covered lakes/rivers where you can sink your vehicle if it weighs too much.\n- Groups of soldier NPCs with kalashnikovs, rocket launchers, etc.\n- Civilian NPCs are often carrying firearms or rocket launchers, and the player character has appropriately buffed health in order to survive large-scale firefights. Many NPCs wear Adidas tracksuits, balaclavas or gas masks; many carry vodka bottles which they may drink from; many are seen squatting on their heels, or doing russian kick dancing, or just lying around drunk in completely random places (with full ragdoll physics).\n- You can use random things like vodka bottles, chairs, etc as melee weapons, or throw them (of course some have more range/damage when thrown than others), sort of like with the Half-Life 2 gravity gun.\n- If you annoy NPCs by attacking them or driving too close they are likely to shout 'CYKA BLYAT' in low-quality, heavily clipped audio.\n- Random bears, some of whom are also carrying firearms although they rarely use them.\n- Your character heals by drinking vodka or eating sunflower seeds, which are dropped by many NPCs when you kill them.\n- The radio stations all play low-quality audio of either patriotic classical music (Anthem of the Soviet Union, Katyusha, etc) or hardbass. You can't turn the car radio off, but pressing the appropriate key will make the player character destroy the radio with whatever weapon they happen to be holding, thus also silencing the music.\n\nUnlike Grand Theft Auto 3 where NPCs are mostly just harmless backdrop, NPCs in this game would follow the formula of Postal 2, or the later parts of Thief Deadly Shadows, where the dynamic interactions between NPCs constantly create amusing (and potentially dangerous) situations around the player character.\n\nAs far as the story and goals go, I feel like the directed 'climbing the ladder' storyline of Grand Theft Auto 3 wouldn't really fit this formula, but I'm not sure what to replace it with. Possibly something like: You play as a native russian who has been living in the UK for years and just recently returned to Russia, you're struggling to find a job and pay your rent, the jobs require you to prove that you're a true russian before you can get hired, so every day you have to go out and find money, vodka, sunflower seeds, etc to survive while also doing missions that revolve around doing ridiculous gopnik meme stuff to prove your identity as a russian.\n\n(Disclaimer: Yes, I know everything involving national stereotypes is going to offend somebody these days. My intention is not to cause offense, I just think it would be amusing to play on these particular stereotypes and memes in the form of a comedy game.)"

n1d6gy,"What if Jet Set Radio, but VR?"," \n\nThe 1999 SEGA classic *Jet Set Radio* would make a great VR game for several reasons. If you don't know what Jet Set Radio is, here are the basics:\n\n* It came out for the SEGA Dreamcast in 1999 as *Jet Grind Radio* and was HD remastered for PC in 2012.\n* It was the very first game to use a cel-shaded 3D art style, similar to *Breath of the Wild*.\n* It's got funky beats.\n* In each level, you rollerblade around and spray all the graffiti targets.\n\nSince you move everywhere by rollerblading, the movement would integrate well into VR. You would swing your arms to rollerblade. The game would have to be converted to first-person, though.\n\nOn controller, the graffiti mechanic works by moving the joystick up, down, or in circular movements, with each successful movement progressing the pre-made graffiti one step further. In VR, you would just move your hands in those movements while holding the graffiti button down, and your chosen design would appear.\n\nOn PC or console, there is a graffiti creator that is a bit difficult to use. After your design is done, you can select it and use it in any level. In VR, you would just choose colors and spray. Then, once in a level, your design would appear as you finished the graffiti steps.\n\nThe only other button is the boost button, and you would hold that as you swing your arms to rollerblade faster. If you IRL jump and land on a rail, you can grind. You can also slide on concrete-textured walls for a short moment before jumping or falling off.\n\nThis would be so ridiculously cool! If you have any ideas or would like to try and make this, please, tell me!"

n155uc,Decision making game from the perspective of an intelligent alien species,"Joined a few subreddits just looking for a creative outlet. Have had this idea swirling around my head and I’m not a game dev nor would have the time to.\n\nTLDR at bottom\n\nHere is the basic story idea with game mechanics to follow: \n\nYou are a member of an intelligent species who are advanced enough to have a society but no technology. Kind of a “one with nature” idea. They depend on the environment to survive and the culture respects and admires the nature around them. The society behaves like most basic societies would, there is no currency and works on a bartering system but everyone helps each other out in a utopia sense but not quite a utopia as there are societal issues (though I haven’t thought about it enough to decide what).\n\nYou are an adolescent coming of age in the society being taught how to belong and what is right and wrong. You come to learn prematurely that your species has the ability to consume live beings (in this case just other animals in the environment, haven’t thought about how consuming live vegetation will be considered) and mildly inherent their knowledge and abilities. (Not a full on one consume and you know everything they know and do everything they do but the more you consume the more you learn) Because this is a truth you are supposed to be eased into at the end of adolescence because as a society it is deemed the most criminal sin and you must be taught to control your urges to do so. You can probably guess that this is the main story/game mechanic depending on the type of game you would make. \n\nWhile struggling with this new information and dealing with internal societal problems that would affect how your society handles the future events (haven’t thought all the way through) you are shocked when a large foreign object (a colony spaceship) flys overhead and crashes off into the distance. \n\nI’m going to summarize the rest of the story idea because I don’t want to make the post too long, but the colony ship is full of humans but you can’t understand them (think subtitles that are gibberish) and you as a species are very frightening to them and as humans first instincts are they either kidnap you not knowing your intelligent for research or attack you depending on your decisions. You could have opportunities to consume humans and if you do the more of their language you learn but the more you isolate yourself from your society and the more you frighten the humans as you are eating them essentially. The rest of the game essentially is dealing with the conflict between humans and your society.\n\nI dislike decision making games that are Morally right choices give good ending and morally bad choices give bad ending. My vision is that it is morally ambiguous, if you choose to never consume or attack humans you will never learn their language and they will never learn you are intelligent and proceed to colonize at your society’s expense. (Maybe unintentional genocide) like habitat destroying haven’t thought to the end yet. If you go full on war you could end up having the humans intentionally wiping you out or vice versa. So my vision is that you make the morally ambiguous right decisions at the right times to lead to an outcome that is neither good nor bad but it’s up to you to decide which.\n\nGame mechanics: Obviously the consume is a main story element and game mechanics. For a text adventure or decision game (like tell-tale series), consuming animals or humans unlock dialogue and action options. For a more 3-d action or rpg focused (I’m thinking like beyond two souls/Detroit become human/until dawn) the consumes would improve your stats or give you movement or world interaction abilities at the cost (or possibly benefit) of the moral storyline.\n\nTLDR: a morally ambiguous decision focused story game as an alien species that can consume life forms for their knowledge and abilities but considers it the ultimate sin in their society whose home world is invaded by a human colony ship that is unaware you are intelligent and tries to colonize at your expense. Consuming humans or wildlife is frowned upon and isolates you from your society but would allow you to fight back/communicate with humans and possibly unlock abilities or improve stats depending on the game genre or scale of the game."

Left fatherless and struggling financially with his mother throughout his early life, protag decides early in life that he wants to become a cop to take down the monsters who killed his father. \n\nGame begins with protag in his late twenties, after a few years on the beat, he finally is experienced enough and able to begin a deep undercover operation, ala Donnie brasco, to gather info to bring down the crime family that killed his father. Chapter 1 would be you leaving the police station and entering into this murky world. \n\nThroughout the game you rise up through the ranks of the mob, bonding with characters that knew your father as you learn more information about the circumstances that led to his death. Elements of murder mystery and the idea that things can be morally grey, people are complex, and events aren’t always as clear cut as they appear on the surface. In this universe the police department you belong to could be involved in corruption or unwarranted brutality and injustice, leading to difficult moral decisions about who to side with.  \n\nMobster characters you meet along the way would be compelling and even likeable. You are able to make decisions that influence whether you allow yourself to get corrupted and sucked into the life, providing false information or withholding important info from your superiors in the force as you build your own crew and empire. Parallels of police corruption vs organised crime, neither is virtuous or inherently evil or virtuous in this game universe. Or you can continue your investigation by the book, recording and compiling accurate information to lead to arrests. Noir style ending perhaps with tragedy no matter who you side with. \n\nThis could be made as an indie game or AAA really, as the dialogue and problem solving is the main focus, it could be done on a shoestring or a big budget. I haven’t figured out the details of the characters, gameplay or story progression, but I think the basic premise is quite strong personally, I would be interested to hear opinions. It could play as a dialogue heavy point and click with strategy elements as you manage your crew and rackets, or be a more action focused game."
n0yu4v,game idea,"I want the game to start with a boy going into the forest like the ones I used to explore as a kid. At the entrance of the forest he meets a ball of light. The ball of light says some words gives him a sword and a heal and flies off. The boy roams around the forest fighting enemies. The combat would be an action RPG. To start you'd be able to heal yourself and kill enemies. You'd keep the same sword the whole game like Zelda. Every enemy and enemy attack would be avoidable (some bosses would have different mechanics). Killing all the enemies at the beginning would make the game easier at first but at the end game you’d have a bad time. However if you avoid every enemy before the final level you'd get a heal upgrade that would give you unlimited mana and allow you to fire your heals at enemies making the last bit of the game way easier. Of course the plot implications would also matter. There'd be a good and bad ending based on whether you killed anything or spared everything. Maybe there'd be a super bad ending if you killed all the NPCs who appear in the 3rd world too. Back to the start for now though. At some point in the first world you'd meet a new friend who would want to play with you. Eventually he'd lead you to a new world, the world of his imagination, and you'd go through that area with him (always going on ahead) solving (his?) puzzles and fighting monsters. Sometime in his world you'd meet an annoying girl who'd tease you. You'd have to deal with her annoyances near the end of the world leading up to saving her from a monster and having her become your friend. After becoming her friend she takes over and takes you to her world. In her world is where the first town is. You meet the queen of her world, who is herself, and have to finish a quest for her. Again solving puzzles and fighting enemies. When you're done you go back to her and she rewards you and offers you a ride home but you decline. Your two friends fly off and you're left alone. You go forward back into your world, which is a lot darker than before psychologically. You're by yourself in the woods at night too. As the player you can infer that boy has run away from home. You fight through some metaphorical manifestations of what you're running away from. You come through it and at the end you hear crying. You follow it and end up looking in on a girl in a house living with a monster. You decide you have to save her. You save the girl and take her into the forest with you where she goes into her world. You have a difficult encounter with a metaphorical wall she put up and if you spare everyone here's where you get the heal projectile after enough dodging. After the wall you go into her world which is full of nightmares. When you defeat them all and solve the most confusing puzzle ever you take her back to your world. The good ending is you realize your home ain't so bad and you go back home with her to find your dad out looking for you and get home to your mum crying. You and your family save the girl too. The next day you introduce her to your friends and you all live happily ever after. The bad ending you get through all the hellish gameplay killing things and she unleashes an even harder boss after which she runs away with you. The ultra bad ending she runs away from you and runs away alone. By yourself in the dark you fight an impossible battle against yourself where your heal is completely disabled. You keep retrying but can't win with fighting. You just have to survive. If you survive you get hit down to 1 hp and just walk off into the forest and the game ends.\n\nSource:  \n[https://estoryideas.wordpress.com/2021/04/28/game/](https://estoryideas.wordpress.com/2021/04/28/game/)"
n0y0ry,Prisoner of War - Battle Royale set inside an underground prison camp,"Yes, this is following the trend of Battle Royales and their explosion in popularity, but I think we can make this one unique.\n\n# Gameplay\n\nThis game is largely the same as others like it; a first person Battle Royale. However, all of the map is set indoors. The weapon-and-resource system would be similar to Apex Legends, but one way this game differs is in lighting. Most of the arena is set in pitch-black darkness, with the exception of light-bulbs around the arena that can be both destroyed and replaced, as well as your flashlight with limited battery. I think this could spice up the gameplay since you now have to play with lighting to even see your opponent.\n\n# Lore\n\nThis is where the real fun begins &gt;:)\n\n*You and other players are prisoners of war. Taken long ago, you were imprisoned in an underground camp. You don't remember why you are here. All that you remember is that every weekend, the prison releases its prisoners into the complex in a cruel game of bloodsport for the warden's entertainment. Every other man you see is just as confused and desperate as you are, but you must push aside your empathy. It might be the difference between your continued survival and your death.*"

A high quality skee ball game where you can use tickets to buy other designs of balls. \n\nThere are already some skee ball games on the app store but all of them are very low quality and need to be updated.

n0kgsf,A Jackbox style social deduction game,"This is as game I am planning on making, and I was wondering what people think.\n\nEach player is paired up with another player. They start having a conversation (Phone-texting style), but they dont know who they are chatting to. Some people will be told to act like someone else (e.g. P1 and P2 having a conversation, P1 is secretly told to act/speak like P3). Some people will be told to naturally introduce a topic to the conversation. (e.g. P4 is told to talk to P3 about, I don't know, donuts, without P3 realising that shes been given a topic)\n\nAfter 2 minutes, each conversation is shown on the TV/Monitor, and everyone guesses who was speaking on their phones. If you guess who you were talking to correctly,  you get points. If you guess the person who they were pretending to be, the pretender get points. After that you get to guess what the random topic was. If you get it right, you get points. If the topic discusser did not manage to discuss the topic (use any of the key words from the topic), They lose points.\n\nThe comedy comes from seeing the funny/stupid conversations that people had, the exaggerations of people pretending to be other people, and eventually finding out who you were talking to the whole time. The stressful party aspect comes from trying to weasel your topic into the conversation before the time runs out."

Players a placed in a situation where like a train has derailed into a busy intersection coming towards you and as a pedestrian you have to dodge the oncoming crash where as you move time moves forward.   It could work for any number of types of accidents.  Could be a mode that you get to create the event you try to then dodge.  You would feel like the flash trying to avoid the accident or even saving other people.

Features could include walking in the least optimal direction/speed, trying to get yourself killed, activating something an NPC has to address at the least convenient times, stocking an inventory of what the adventurer needs minus an item, etc. \n\nThis is by no means supposed to be a good game, but I could see it being entertaining similar to ""get down mr.

n07b88,MMO-Lite - Uphevil,"Prologue:\n\nI love MMO's, however I'm getting older and I'm tired of their grindy nature. I've taken a liking to things like Fortnite, where there is an overarching story, but I can just jump in and play whenever I like. I'm tired of playing games that are psychologically designed to keep you playing long after you've had fun. You play, you have fun, you put down. No FOMO. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Pitch.\n\nAt it's heart this is is a cross between Warframe, WoW and Fortnite. Third person, over the shoulder view.\n\nThe heart of this game is movement. This has to be right. Players need to be able to run, slide, climb, double jump and parkour around as smoothly and fluidly as you can in Warframe. This would be the number 1 non-compromisable feature. Movement has to feel fast, responsive, fluid and fun.  After that, the world is set in an ever changing high fantasy land. The world was devoured by magic, with only chunks of it appearing at a time out of a chaotic devouring black hole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Start.\n\nThe player character starts on a floating island in the sky. Only translucent Wizard is there. He explains to the character that the world was consumed by magic, he has managed to save a handful of people to this chunk of remaining earth. Your mission is to jump down to the planet below to gain enough resources to rebuild the sky fortress. If anything happens to you, he will teleport you back and you can use what resources you have gathered to rebuild society in the sky until he can harness enough power to undo the damage.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe loop.\n\nThe player starts by creating a standard avatar, they pick a sigil (one of three). Fighter, Archer, Wizard. These are interchangeable at any time in the cloud platform. They pick a section, PVE or PVP, once they're in a section, they pick a ""tube"" containing solo, doubles or groups (4) and jump in. \n\nThis spits the player out with a magical barrier, they fly through the sky and can reach any area of the current map from the center. They land with a crater that damages anything nearby. \n\nThe player then has a couple of options to progress. \n\n1) A personal story quest they can progress. e.g. The wizard needs a magical orb. The player is guided to an appropriate location to find it. There is a story I have in mind.\n\n2) A class quest. e.g. The Fighter must find a shield. The archer must find a magic refilling quiver. The Wizard must find a stave. These quests are one time only per class and are fairly easy unlocking new abilities in the form of a light progression.\n\n3) Progress the map objective. Each time you land the map objective is different. This will be the core gameplay of Uphevil. There are multiple scenarios. Sometimes there are swarms of minions, with the goal to kill the most. Other times huge behemoths where the players have to survive. Jumping puzzles that need to be completed in a certain time. This can be expanded in infinitely. The PVE content is the main content that rotates each game. Happy to explain more here if required.\n\nAt some point, huge chunks of the map (all over the place) will begin to turn dark red and crumble away to the black hole with earthquakes being another cue that the chunk the player is on is about to disappear. Eventually all the chunks will disappear until there is only a single player or group remaining at which point they are teleported back to base with their quest or world items. \n\nThese items are then used to rebuild various wings of the sky fortress (cosmetic only), or unlock class abilities. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nProgression.\n\nInitially, progression is based in unlocking all class abilities (which should be fairly quick and easy). Once all abilities for all three classes have been unlocked. Sub-classes unlock. If you unlock Archer and Wizard, you unlock the Dark Ranger sigil. Archer and fighter = Rogue. Wizard and fighter = Battlemage. all classes unlocked and you unlock the last class which is a hybrid. \n\nOutside of that the player earns materials in the world to rebuild the sky fortress and progress the story. Enemies will drop components of their type that can be used to unlock cosmetic armor pieces. E.g; The player killed a bunch of skeletons that dropped bone fragments, the player takes that back to the castle, to the Fighter wing, hands them to a crafter who can make some 'Bone Pauldrons'. All cosmetic. \n\nI've toyed with the idea of a minor rock, paper, scissors mode for types of armor and weapons having a slight disadvantage over certain enemies and other players, but at the most this would be a 5% discrepancy.\n\nOnce a player has defeated a scenario (not win, just played), they will earn a crystal with the scenarios name on it. The player can then add (infinitely) to the drop tunnel before jumping in to assist in either influencing or discouraging certain scenarios. \n\nScenarios can be added as part of the game as time goes on, or as DLC.\n\nThere will be scenario based stories as well as a long slower overarching story. Think monster of the week episodes of x-files along with the long conspiracy arc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGameplay:\n\nThe moment to moment gameplay needs to be fun and engaging. I'm going to leverage other games to show what I mean here as I already have with the movement systems. The main idea is that the classes and interactions themselves are fun enough to play on their own without skinner boxes to instill FOMO. If someone plays for a bit, then puts it down, I want that to be okay too, people should be able to play at their own pace or catch up with the story if they want. For now I'll just comment on the main classes, but it will be easy to see how the sub-classes will unfold in a similar fashion.\n\nI'm looking for each character to be independent, but I would like to cater for everyone to create a 'holy trinity' if they so wish. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbilities:\n\nI was leaning towards a more GW2 style of abilities rather than the overcrowded WoW style. The one thing I hate about GW2 was that the abilities were tied to weapons, so if you liked the two handed sword aesthetic (like I do), but liked the 2H Mace abilities you were stuck. Also with WoW's abilities, while I like the illusion of choice, all it does is lead to damage rotations which can take focus off what's going on on the screen and for immersion, that should always be first; The ability to ""fight the fight"".\n\nThis could be that classes have only a few impactful abilities each or have a large pool of them, but can only take so many at a time. \n\nAbilities will perform differently if the player is moving forward (or strafing) giving an aggressive take on the ability, whereas if they are moving backwards (backpedaling) they will perform defensively.\n\nThat said, the abilities need to be fun each time you press them. These will be brief here, but I can expand on all abilities. \n\nI picture the fighter charging and leaping. Big hits moving forward, parrying moving backwards. Holding up their shield in front of them and stopping projectiles from their allies or parrying an incoming arrow if it's timed well. Shield and weapon throws, combinations of attacks performing different things, like if you leap then attack, you can perform an AOE whirlwind. If you Leap then Shield block, you'll make a defensive barrier. Each consecutive successful hit would increase in damage to a reasonable point.\n\nFor the Archer. The bow definitely has to be ""chargeable"" increasing in damage up to a certain point. Rapid fire arrows, explosive arrows with knockback and the ability to place a smokescreen then explosive retreat causing the archer to backflip out of combat. The ability for arrows to pierce enemies and rain from the sky. \n\nThe Wizard would be mostly fire based spells moving forward with frost based moving backwards. I envision meteor strikes, flame wall, good ol' fireball, but as a quick lob rather than a long cast (castable while moving). Defensively you would have Ice storm and Ice barrier. The Wizard (and sub classes) would also have access to heal others while the the standard classes would only be able to self heal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMMO Maybes?\n\nProfessions. I think the player obtaining items in the world then bringing those items to crafting NPC's works better than the player trying to master every craft. I'd be happy for a potion and food system as long as they don't become mandatory, so only minor buffs or they are really cheap ala GW2. Armor and weapon cosmetics were already planned. I don't see fishing being a thing in a rapid pace action game, but hey, Fortnite did it and it's ""fine"".\n\nMounts. I'm actually open to a mount collection system. Somethings out in the wild to tame, others to collect parts and craft. GW2 did mounts amazingly well, not going to lie, that would be hard to top.\n\nAchievements. I don't think they add much except to make things grindy, but I think there is some merit there when it can incentivize 'different' gameplay etc. Like play a match without killing anything to get ""the pacifist"" title. They're always fun, but not mandatory.\n\nTalents.\n\nA lot of games have talent like systems. I'm not sure about these. I did love the freedom in the initial vanilla wow systems, but it was always the illusion of choice. I'm not sure about these. I'd really rather stay away from the ""Meta"" into just having fun fighting random PVE or PVPVE scenarios. There's room there though if it was deemed boring without them, but it leans against my ""jump in and play"" philosophy a bit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nConclusion. \n\nTLDR: Basically I'm trying to make a high fantasy Warframe without the pointless grind, insane modding and stale level design. It's part WoW without the grind, FOMO and never ending systems. Some GW2 with better more fluid movements (although the mounts really are top notch) and without the static world of Tyria. Maybe with a splash of Fantasy Fortnite without the building and with slicker faster movement. I will say that the fantasy splashes Fortnite has done, It's done well. The bows feel great, when the boom-bow was out, it was my favorite. When Cap's shield was out, it was fun as hell throw or block and the sword of infinity... Well we all know how that turned out!\n\nThanks for reading and I'm open to any questions about systems as I've been daydreaming about this for a while, while I can't do artwork or code. I've got a lot of ideas around the moment to moment gameplay, systems, lore, abilities classes and scenarios."
n075j6,"A simulator that allows you to build/create your own pond, lake, river or stream and put items(structure) and fish in them!","I’ve been sitting on this idea for weeks now debating on whether or not it would even be worth trying to create. \n\nSo you would be able to create your own lakes and rivers and whatnot, but also be able to introduce fish and other creatures such as frogs, crawfish, ducks, and mice/rats. As well as being able to place your own vegetation such as lily pads, reeds, different types of weeds and rocks/fallen trees/logs. \n\nYou would start out on a fish hatchery and be tasked with placing certain fish in certain areas to help with their population, and in return you get access to more fish species. \n\nAfter about 4 missions you would unlock “Sandbox Mode” where you can start to create your own ecosystems while also doing tasks like “Make sure your crappies have deep enough water and a sustainable amount of forage fish”. \n\nIt would work similar to Farming Simulator, Planet Zoo, and Jurassic World Evolution.  \n\nYou would have about 15 species of fish to start off with out of about 150-300 total species.\n \nFish would have needs such as depth, structure, food, and space. For example, a crappie would need at least 6 feet of water to be comfortable, but over 12 feet of water in order to grow to bigger sizes. They would also need minnows and other things like water bugs and tadpoles to eat. Along with some fallen trees that they could hide in to stay away from predators. \n\nFish would have predatory behavior and would search for other fish or creatures (a Muskie would look for ducks or ducklings, frogs, rats, and smaller fish to eat when it becomes hungry) \n\nYou would be able to recreate lakes such as Leech lake, Lake Travis, Lake Manitoba, and others on about half the scale.\n\n\nWhat do you guys think about this?"
n04s13,"A third person/RTS zombie game, with a twist..","For this zombie game,  you are the zombie. But not just any zombiev; a zombie overlord whom can control other zombies.  Your zombies come in different strengths and weaknesses.  An example would be the typical slow zombie that is relatively durable. A fast running but weak zombie.  A ""hunter""-esque zombie that can stalk victims. \n\nParts if this comes from a cancelled game back in 2007 called Possession. It also allowed to directly  control a single zombie. I think the concept would be refreshing in a market where you are always the ""survivor""."

n01n3m,Am an indie game developer and am currently recruiting my team we are working on an open world zombie apocalyptic game with the latest and realistic features i really hope everyone can give us some likes and follows,
n01500,"Level up your friend, complement your own skills, and then face them","I was imagining a level-up system like Mass Effect's - you can put first aid skill points into your teammate, so you have more skill points to use for yourself. Naturally, you would want your teammates to complement your skills. \n\nI would want a twist at the end of the game where your friend is turned against you, and you now have to fight them. So if you buff up your friend's defense but his attack sucks, you'll just have to avoid him and wear him down.\n\nI hope I phrased this the way I wanted it to be. The general idea is you have a good friend with the protag follow the whole story and you rely on them, and in the end, you have to fight them."
n00aj0,"A city building game where you build your city in a dense forest with huge trees but YOU CAN'T CUT DOWN ANY OF THOSE TREES! You gotta build your city around trees, blending in with the nature.","Maybe this is a bit too much for an indie game dev (I don't really know much about game development) but yeah, it's an idea.\n\nYou could set it as you're playing as an elf chief setting up a settlement for his few people in the middle of the jungle. Ancient elven gods forbade cutting down any of the huge trees, So you're supposed to build the city without removing any trees.\n\n1- How am I supposed to build a city without cutting down a single goddamn tree?!\n• You can build around the trees, attached to the trees, platforms, bridges connecting one tree to another, TREEHOUSES! Or there could be some hollow trunk trees where you can build into it. Just be creative, go crazy!\n \n2- Well but how can I build when I can't gather wood for building, since cutting down trees is forbidden in ancient elven religion??\n• There could be clear open spots with no huge trees. You can plant trees on these spots for the sole purpose of harvesting wood for building. (Elven gods doesn't care about these trees elves plant themselves... come up with a good enough excuse for these sacrificial trees 🌚)\n\n3- What else can we do with this elven city we build, other than just building stuff around trees?\n• Just add other basic city building features like gathering resources (food, water, stone, unicorn horns or whatever)\n• There could be a day/night cycle (it'd look frigging awesome in night with fairy lights and all) and a weather cycle where winter affect your crops, you gotta harvest firewood and food and stuff.\n• Management functions! I don't know how complex it'd be to make this, but you can add a function to set up your own rules in the city?\n• If somehow you miraculously made it online multiplayer, you can let the player be the grand chief of the city, divide the land, invite their friends to their server and grant the invited friends title of lords and ladies and let them manage different parts of the divided land? Or am I going insane with my imagination?\n• Also if it's multiplayer there could be trading! No?\n\n4- Okay but do we build a garrison and spawn elf warriors, build the pointy ear army and conquer the neighboring cities where lowly creatures such as humans and dwarves reside in?\n• Sure I mean if war strategy and combat is your thing.\n• But I personally thought of it as more of a sandboxy management game for creative people out there who loves trees, forests and fantasy.\n• You can add guards for defence against wild animals or stone golems, or add hunters so that you can hunt down unicorns and Griffins or maybe mermaids? Nah (that'll be another game where you build Atlantis)\n• If you wanna make it bloody, sure go for it but please keep the creative functions of building without harming the forest.\n\n5- That's it?\n• Nope! The last but not least, make it so that you can walk around in flesh and bone of the elven chief, inside the city where you built yourself! Preferably in 3rd person.\n\n** If you've read this far, thanks for reading all my nonsense and sorry for writing a lot of probably useless stuff in-between points. I'm not really that good at writing my ideas but I hope I've conveyed my idea through this.\nAlso the basic function I wanted to highlight is ""City builder set in a forest where you can't cut down trees so that you gotta find ways to design the city blending in to the nature"". Everything else is just one possible theme you can apply this function into.\nIf anyone pick up this crazy idea and develop something based on it, I don't even need credits bruh just develop the game and let me know so that I can play it! °^° **"
mzymm2,"A game where you code your abilities (not in a traditional text sense, but more scratch style)","This would be a sci-fi dungeon crawler where you would find blocks of code on abandoned computers which you assign to yourself (or other players if you were to make this multiplayer).\n\nThe blocks can be merged together, for example, every time you hit an enemy (1st block), they burn (2nd block).\n\nThe blocks could also have a chance of being corrupt, since they are on abandoned computers, these corruptions would make it backfire (from our previous example, it could have a 5% chance of burning the player) or they would break another part of the player’s code (again from our previous example, it could burn your muscles making you run slower).\n\nAdding blocks to your player would cause their code to lose some space, (for example you have 4kb of room for your player’s blocks and for every block added, and depending on how powerful said block is, it would use up more memory) this would balance out the mechanic so you wouldn’t be able to 1 hit the final boss when you got to it.\n\nIf you were to adapt this to multiplayer, there could also be blocks that are viruses, these viruses would cause debuffs to the player they are put on, for example their hit box might be increased so that they are easier to hit, or they have less health so they are easier to kill.\n\nAll the blocks would be gone upon the player’s death and they would start again (unless it is multiplayer, in which case they would probably respawn because matches would last around a minute if not).\n\nThere could also be a system for adding custom blocks to the game, though I realise it is time consuming to make these so there probably won’t be.\n\nThought of this literally now so apologies if it’s not well thought-out or even a good idea. Also writing this in mobile so sorry for bad formatting if there is any."
mzxi8g,Horror game about American religiosity,"My vision would be like FC5 crossbred with Resident Evil 7.\n\nSo a family in small, secluded town in deep south. Father is devoted christian. You can see that in his eyes. The confidence, devotion in everything he says. And he could torture his wife and kids because he thinks that's the will of god. Or because he believes they should listen to him as a head of the family. He starves them, beats them, improsones them in a cellar while preaching the bible.\n\nMeanwhile the rest of town citizens doesn't do anything about it coz they're all also devoted christians and he is a local authority as church elder / pastor. So it wouldn't have to be only indoors.\n\nAnd you could play as one of his kid trying to e.g. help your siblings and mother escape from that hell.\n\nIt could be indoors and outdoors."

Certain players also can be designated as leaders, which gives them special powers."
mzeetl,A first-person psychological horror adventure game idea.,"You wake up in your home.  Spend some time with your family and go about your daily life.  However this is implemented is up to the discretion of the dev, but the main element here is to familiarize the player with an atmosphere that feels like home base.  Something with familial ties / a slice of life.  How it's experienced and guided is up to interpretation, but get the player feeling like they've had a genuine day in the life of this character.  They return to bed at the end of the day and go to sleep.\n\nYou wake up in your home and begin to repeat what was essentially the first cycle in the gameplay loop.  Except elements stand out as unusual.  Some repeating dialogue.  Repeating scenarios.  Etc.  Give the feeling that time is being messed with at least a little.  Or a lot.  Maybe you want to jump in the deep end with a full groundhogs day style loop here.  Either way the function is to reveal to the player that things aren't as they seemed.  Finish day.  Return home.  Go to bed.  Sleep.\n\nWake up.  Some things are physically different at this point.  Maybe objects are rearranged.  Colors or lighting is shifted subtly.  Begin building tension through a feeling of unease.  At this point the protagonist shifts from bewilderment into fear.  Things aren't as they should be, and they only seem to be getting worse.  That's the feeling they and the player should begin to pick up on.\n\nAt this point the main gameplay loop is established and the fun begins.  At some point in this loop or the next, the protagonist should stumble upon something different by trying to change their behavior to change their circumstance.  What they stumble upon is designed to make them question the loop they're experiencing.  Like a glitch in the matrix type thing.  The protagonist has done something that wasn't exactly accounted for, and it took the world around them a moment to catch up.  This shows the player that the world is responding to their actions, trying to maintain the illusion and hold on them in this loop.\n\nNow from here I haven't given too much thought on the finer details but there are some over-arching ideas here on what I've been building to.  The general plot from this point forward is that of a horror adventure detective game where the protagonist tries to learn about the loop they seem to be stuck in as the world around them seems to degrade after each passing cycle.  Through careful examination and experimentation, the protagonist comes to learn that they're in something of a dream world but it seems to be outside of their majority control.  Gameplay elements and discoveries reveal that the protagonist actually never woke up on the first night, slipped into a coma, and some demonic entity is attempting to keep them trapped in this state of limbo, feeding in their spirit as their body slowly atrophies in the real world.  Naturally it's up to the protagonist to find a way to break the demon's hold on them, and find a way to wake themselves up before they're trapped and ultimately consumed.\n\nThe general atmosphere of the game could become quite dark as the protagonist discovers they're trapped in a living nightmare with a demonic entity in control of their dreams.  And due to the nature of dreams the devs have room to create as the world can be warped however they please.\n\nIt also has the potential for an unsettling ending where even after the protagonist defeats the demon, wakes up at the hospital, and comes home, the game can end with them going to bed at the end of the night.  Naturally with that being such a major mechanic of the early dream gameplay loops, it could leave the player with a deeply unsettling feeling even after winning.  Not knowing whether or not they've actually succeeded or if they've actually been tricked into losing."
mza7fo,The Internet in a game,An idea to make browser game that is a maze of different rooms. Each room should have their own theme and contain one or more portals that would link you to a website.  Instead of searching for Reddit you just have it in your starting room and could walk right in.  Instead of scrolling the internet with boredom you can instead walk through the internet while being entertained by imaginative landscape and potentially finding a website you haven't seen before.  Maybe it's interesting enough to keep you entertained for a few minutes before you walk somewhere else.\n\nAlso the rooms can have their own physics like being able to jump super high in a low gravity environment or swim in all directions through an underwater wonderland.  Maybe even have a jetpack minigame where you'd have to avoid going into website portals and reach as high as possible before being linked to whichever portal you accidentally hit.\n\nIf this is popular you can start tracking data to show more websites that are interesting to the specific user. \n\nIf it's popular you can sell ads to specific sites so their portals show up more.  Maybe even make sponsor themed room for The website like having a giant Reddit alien in a corner and a rocket ship going to the moon in the other.\n\nThe possibilities are endless.\n\nHell if it really catches on make it a web browser on its own.  Instead of Chrome or Firefox you got Axonia (my own working title).\n\nMaybe you can build it for VR so you can use it with a headset.  Maybe make it into an operating system so you can scroll through your own files while walking through your in game house.  \n\nOnce it's an operating system you're also gonna want to make it a social media and add a public world where people can virtually walk around and play games together.  \n\nAnd now boom you just created READY PLAYER ONE IRL\n\nCreate virtual cafes where people can talk.  Virtual theatres where you can watch your favourite Netflix movies inside the world of Axonia.  Or maybe go to the Amazon store and visually see the products it recommends for you displayed on the storefront.\n\nThe possibilities are endless in Axonia.  You just have to start by making it.\n\nIf you actually decide to start making this I'll be happy to share some more insight I have and to help make it possible in any way I can.  This could be the future of how we interact with the world.  All we have to do is build it.

I am looking for ideas for the plot and story, as well as some horror events and occurrences. I am totally open for some ideas! The game is physiological, and the setting and atmosphere is dark and unnerving. Paranormal events take place while you navigate the house (radio turns on, footsteps, candles blow out, writing on the walls, grudge noises, etc). I could really use some more mechanics or paranormal events, but I need to develop story. Give me ideas!!!"
mz06ma,Open world RPG Managed with 4X/RTS under the hood,"Think Bethesda open world RPG combined with a Paradox 4x strategy game.\n\nTake a game like Skyrim and make all of the locations nodes, which can be cleared/captured/redecorated/settled. Then run a 4X/RTS simulation in the background that tracks the strength of factions, trade routes, resources, etc. and plays out various actions across the map.\n\n* The player gets a quest by kingdom A to clear a dungeon. After that, either kingdom A will need to station guards there otherwise risk it being reclaimed by hostile NPCs. Dungeons could also offer resources (mines) or research (the longer mages/necromancers/creatures inhabit a location the more valuable it becomes as a research point) or thieves may have stored valuables in crates for the kingdom to collect.\n* Kingdom B attacks and takes over a village. Kingdom A asks you to join a group of soldiers to take the village back and do at least 3 radiant quests for villagers to get them back on their feet.\n* Kingdom A and B's hostilities become full out war. As you navigate the map battles will be being fought over different areas. Cities and towns will be under different rule or partially destroyed.\n* All quests would need to be radiant quests, but due to the simulation under the hood, dialogue could give background motivation to all quests. ""We have reports of something or someone attacking people in this region and it is negatively impacting trade. Investigate, eliminate the threat and report back"".\n* Factions might be added to the world mid game. Like a faction of undead that start spreading across the map claiming nodes and getting stronger. The goal becomes not just becoming a strong player character, but forming alliances and choosing which factions to strengthen.\n* Uncovering legendary artifacts might make you stronger, but giving them to the right faction might be a better strategic play.\n\nDelving deeper into future possibilities, one could theoretically add an RTS element in and make all structures dynamic (build, capture, destroy). A few games have tried mixing FPS and RTS, but I think two main issues is \n\n1. getting the timescale right so that players can properly manage both and not be overwelmed\n2. getting game play right in both FPS and RTS modes.\n\nWhat I'm suggesting here is that the player would have no involvement in the RTS mechanics. They are essentially a rogue element on the map the AI has to deal with). The same goes for the 4X mechanics. So the main issue I see is getting the time scale right. \n\nHow long should it take for buildings to be made or troops to move across a map? How long should a battle for a village or castle take? Events have to happen fast enough to be interesting but slow enough that the player has a chance to watch the world grow over time.\n\nThere are a lot of technical hurdles to pass before anything like this is possible, but it's still interesting to think about."

myu2v5,Video Game IP After 10 Years,"If an existing video game hasn’t created a second game, part 2, volume 2 etc in 10 years, then that game series could now be opened to any other developer to develop and release their game. \n\nFor example: LA Noire was released in May 2011 and next month would be 10 years since its release. So after May 2021, the IP (Intellectual Property), name, concept, branding etc. would be available to anyone. \n\nDoesn’t just have to be a second game either, but could also be a third, fourth, fifth etc. video game in the series. \n\nIs 10 years too short or too long?"
mys7xt,A procedurally generated game with a story.,"This is part of a slightly longer mechanical idea, but since I'd like to see how you'd improve this idea first I'm posting this as its own mechanic.  Come back in around a month and I'll probably have my other idea up by then.\n\nBecause of the nature of procedural generation, especially open world games using it, most games with it can't take advantage of a story.  Here are some ideas I have to get around it.  \n\n* In each world, the wilderness is randomly generated but there are X prebuilt villages which will always spawn somewhere in the map.  You could tamper with the randomness a bit if you wanted to, like making the water village always spawn near the coast or always making rival tribes x and y be n distance away from each other.  Of course, only the key characters would have to stay consistent. \n\n* The game is written through a type of madlib.  A template is chosen and elements within the story are changed without much influence on each other.  The templates themselves could work off of each other to always keep you on your toes.  For instance, the elf and orc working together, the elf betraying the orc, and the orc betraying the elf could all be equal possibilities. \n\n* A full historical simulator.  This is something that could be quite difficult to achieve depending on how it's done.  The simulator could have a list of possibilities to choose from for historical events, such as a change of monarchy to democracy, an invasive species, or a war.  This would probably be easy to make a model for, but it would be hard to make the game react to the story. \n\n* Use an ai like GPT3.  The technology is getting there, but we're not there yet.\n\nKeep in mind that for many randomly generated systems, things that are generated within the system have a chance of all feeling samey if not done well.  Unless you hit a bug or an extreme case."

mtzlrl,"An MMORPG that is Zelda like (top down), same style except you can’t travel at night and you progress through by collecting resources that allows you to camp out.","I am thinking of a farming concept to get food or you can outright buy from the store and very high prices. Monsters that get progressively harder the further out you travel.

mtyo9c,"A strategy video game or boardgame where you play as the head of the goverment response to a zombie outbreak in a city, and have to manage different operations, departments, and political groups to prevent anarchy and contain the virus.","So basically the main concept of the game is juggling differing groups while also preventing public unrest and hopefully ending the zombie outbreak. You would have different ways of dealing with the zombie outbreak that would utilize different groups, for example you could research a cure using scientists, contain it using police and later military troops, manage public relations with the public, quarantine certain areas etc..\n\nBut the interesting part would be say you put too much time into the research part and the zombies get out of control and overwhelm local order, say you gave the military too much control of the situation, boom they overthrow you and establish a military autocracy, or if an area has too many infected/not enough goverment control and order it will lose trust, fall into chaos and not be able to be controlled. Maybe if the district with power/water gets overwhelmed with zombies/chaos the entire cities trust in you would be affected, or encouraging citizens to become armed and fight back may have unintended side affects if they lose trust in you. Just interesting choices and strategy ideas.\n\nIts a rough idea but i think it would be a pretty awesome strategy game, and a unique perspective from the zombie genre."

mtt3bt,"i am new, and i have a fnaf fan game idea.","i am not even sure this even is the right place but i am doing this anyway, so here it is.\n\ni have an idea for a FNAF fan game, think like a mix of the joy of creation and phasmophobia combined into the FNAF 1 location.\n\nplot: you are a rookie professional ghost hunter investigating reports from customers and concerned employees about paranormal activity in a freddy fazbear's pizza plaza location in colorado, your home country. the reports are varied between full-sized-apparitions and poltergiest-like activity (things toppling/being thrown all over). as a testament to prove yourself to your colleague's (and a dare from your friends), you now arrive to your hometowns local freddy's. a employee gets you into the location for the night, and you get to work with the equipment you have.\n\nyour objective is to explore all rooms in the location while dodging the mobile animatronics as they hunt you, you can fight them off at first, but they get stronger and more aggressive the more you fight, you can also hide from them, but they get smarter the more you hide. You need to stretch both out evenly as you gather enough data to discover what happened, and then get out.\n\nways to fight: you can fight back from the horrors of the animatronics, with a plethora of equipment that affects each animatronic differently.\n\nflashlight: this works on all animatronics but works best on foxy. flash the light in the animatronics eyes to slow them down, it stops foxy in his tracks if he is walking towards you, but if you shine the light in foxy's face as he is *sprinting,* he stumbles on his back and is stunned for a couple of seconds as he gets back up.\n\nUV flashlight and UV glowstick: a variation of the original flashlight, it is used mainly to find clues and track down things (as spirits move, they will leave UV traces that look like blood, footprints, handprints, and other things), but it is a key in detecting shadows, spirits, and golden freddy. while keeping the light on spirits can make them go away, both shadows and golden freddy are not affected by the light. in fact, golden freddy starts to run at you if the UV catches him, a different thing fends him and the shadows off. glowsticks work the same way, but glow permanently\n\nsalt: once you detect shadows, they will slowly chase you down, it is easy to avoid them, but they get faster with time, and you cannot hide from them. but if you get them to walk on salt, they will disappear.\n\npizza: chica is only dormant in two places, the stage and the kitchen. but when she chases you, there is no stopping her (you can hide from her, but as said earlier, they get smarter). except for pizza, you can quickly make up to five pizzas in the kitchen, but only cook when she is on stage or she will kill you.\n\nspirit box: use this to communicate with the spirits or the animatronics (you can only communicate with animatronics if they are dormant or resting), but be careful what you ask or they will get hostile. the noise it makes is very loud, and attracts attention, but it disorients freddy temporarily if he is near it.\n\nradio and stage lights: bonnie has a automatic detection system for when the stage lights come on and music starts to play, when this happens, he will rush to the stage to start his show. you need both to get him back to the stage, but one or the other will slow him down greatly. lights and radio can be on for about 20 seconds (enough time to get the other one on, and if not, than it will shut off), and the radio doubles as a audio distraction. but the others will try to tamper or deactivate both by ejecting the battery to the radio or deactivating the stage lights.\n\ncross: the only counter to golden freddy, only effective when you find him with the UV light, shove it out at him and he will dissolve away for a while. but he will come back later.\n\nhiding: there are some places that are good to hide in, and other places that are not very good to hide in. the animatronics are the only ones you can hide from, but they can hear you if they are close and quiet. you can hold your breath, and you should not move when they are close.\n\nlockers (large): the best place to hide in, roomy and comfortable, you can move around a bit and have good view of searching animatronics. but they can rather quickly learn to search the big lockers for you, after which it will be a gamble of if they find you in them.\n\nlockers (small): much more useful as storage for equipment rather than hiding in them, but better than nothing. there is a very small chance that there is other things in them and it will take time to clear the things out before you can hide. since it is cramped, you will move around a little and breath a bit louder, but it makes for a better hiding place against the animatronics\n\ndrawers: the most risky but most rewarding hiding place, very uncomfortable. it takes a bit to get in and out of the drawer and you move a lot and breath very loudly. but it is worth the risk, it takes a while for animatronics to get down to your level and get you.\n\nequipment: you start like in phasmaphobia, with varied detection tech.\n\nthermometer gun: just like in phasmaphobia, point at a object and pull the trigger and you can read the temperature.\n\ncameras (picture): taking pictures makes a flash, a good way to record spiritual activity\n\nmotion detectors: this notifies you of movement in a area in front of it, a good way of recording movements of animatronics or spirits.\n\nvideo cameras: put them in places to record spiritual activity, use you phone to look through them. but when things go wrong, they are good for finding and tracking animatronics. they will strike and disable cameras if they find them, so place them in hard to reach or hidden places. they have night vision. but with limited battery and extra battery spent when night vision is activated.\n\nnoise detectors: they detect noise from within a radius. put them in certain places to detect spritual activity or animatronic activity.\n\nnoise makers: limited in number, but cause a noisy distraction for attracting animatronics.\n\ni estimate a 6 hour gameplay time, with each ""level"" as each hour from 12 PM to 6 AM.\n\nyou have full free roam of the whole environment and can stay in the office if you want, but there is so much more to enjoy and explore.\n\nevents: there are events through the whole game, about 10 minutes after the start you try to use the spirit box and get knocked out, you wake up five minutes later in the parts room. The employee that gets you in the building dies about 30 minutes in. and at 4:30 AM golden freddy can start to stalk you.\n\ncharacter traits: each animatronic, spirit, and shadow has a certain trait and behavior pattern.\n\nanimatronics: the animatronics are specialized in what they do to where they go, all animatronics have a ""resting"" state, where you can investigate the animatronics and use the spirit box to communicate with the spirits in them.\n\nfreddy: his trait is his stealth, he stays to the shadows and corners waiting to ambush you. he slows when you look through the camera at him, and he is very sensitive to sound. noise makers get him to move faster towards them.\n\nchica: she occaisionally moves between the different rooms, but she stays between the stage and kitchen. she will investigate the kitchen if you make noises in it. checks drawers\n\nfoxy: stays between his stage and the parts and service room, he walks when searching for you and charges directly at you when he see's you. searches small and large lockers\n\nbonnie: patrols the whole building when active, searches large lockers.\n\ngolden freddy: when he is active, he will slowly stalk you while invisible. if he is in front of a video camera with night vision on, you can see his sillouett that glitches on the screen. you cant hide from him.\n\nshadows: they are like a reflection of the charachters they represent, but you can't hide from them. they will directly chase you very slowly.\n\nspirits: slightly more helpful than harmful, they lead you to clues about the history of the building if you follow their trails. but they act just like the shadows."
mtsmhz,Guild names,"I've been building a game for awhile. The game is all about managing a guild with up to 8 members, members can be human, dwarves or elves. Each member starts at tier one but can evolve/change class up to tier 4, each time having 3 options (some options recoupe themself if you the two classes are near enough in the class tree). The big customization is that you get a guild really varied when you have multiple tier 3 or 4. Supports and healers are not locked on a race, if you choose a human, it can evolve to figther-&gt;knight-&gt;paladin, if you have a dwarf you can evolve to hermit-&gt; mountainer-&gt; elder one (aoe mage/ sup). You don't want to wait tier 4 for a support with a human? Simple, evolve your tier 1 explorer in a scout (tier 2) or mage-&gt; templar (tier 3, healer/tank). \n\nAny way the whole thing is a tactical rpg with dungeons and quests almost randomly generated. Each quest have a maximum of members you can send (you could send less to maximize xp, but you can't go over the limit.\n\nAnyway, i've been generating a list of guild you will come across during the playthrough. If you have another game with a different name, it will show as another guild if you do another playthrough or if you simply have more than one game at the same time. I want approximately 6 to 9 guilds by playthrough. At first, I only made a few list (adjective + creature/stuff + synonyne of guild) that would cross match name and it worked alright but all the guild names were so freaking forgertable. So i though about asking you guys, give me ideas so i can have a list of interesting and unique names. Don't be afraid of making it funny or giving it a theme (only mages or only range) get crazy you guys!\n\nIf you want some other info ask away!"

mtqk78,Looking for a small scale strategy idea,"I want to make a small scale grid based strategy game, something that you could pick it up, rounds take a few minutes and you are able to get a strategy fix. I say small scale because I am thinking of a small grid size like 5x5, or 8x8. I am having trouble coming up with an deep interesting idea that isn't just a copy of into the breach. Anyone got an idea ?"
mtq90x,"A game about tornados, and ragdoll physics.","**STORY**:   \nThe story of this game is simple. You're a meteorologist and there's a tornado hitting town. You go hit a switch to get the tornado siren to go off, but the wire has been chewed through by a rat. So you need to go pull the switch on all of the sirens around town to alert the town that there's a tornado. The story kind of has a big loop hole because the tornados are already on the group and you have to go pull the siren switches, but it's just a small silly game.  \n\n\n**GAMEPLAY**:  \nThe game would have ragdoll physics almost like human fall flat. The game would be windy and every now and then a big gush of win comes and pushes you over. Stuff is flying around and landing and all of this stuff can knock you over. You need to go from point A (The start of the map) to point B (The end of the map, where the siren is). Some obstacles would be puzzles, platforming, smaller objectives like getting people to safety, and trying to stay alive. If the tornado hits you, you die. If you get hit to many times by stuff flying around, you die. There would also be looters that you need to fight every now and then. While all of this is happening the tornado would be coming towards you, and the closer it gets the more stuff it throws your way. Some of the smaller stuff doesn't effect your health, but will slow you down. All of the stuff that's flying towards you from the tornado is random and will land in random positions. So you could be walking and a cow could come flying from the tornado and knock you over. Since the cow is bigger you would lose one heart. You'd get three hearts, and if you get hit three times you die.   \n\n\nSorry if I'm not explaining this well, I didn't give this much thought. IDK how to make games so I thought someone would like this idea. This game would be just another simple physics game, but I feel like the tornado element would be unique. I feel like this game would be easy to make, and it would be for beginners. A lot of the game I'm imaging would be in the same style as human fall flat."
mtprjh,Any A-RPG or RTS game idea,"Literally any idea. Just for the A-RPG, if your idea is set on a western world it would be good for what's in my mind, but if it's not western it's ok too, just share your ideas."
mtn9bw,"A relatively simple RPG inspired by the ""questing party"" trope","So this is an idea I've been messing around with for a bit but I haven't actually started work on it. I'm pretty well-versed in RPG Maker and so thinking about my idea, it would be really easy to make. Due to the simplicity of the gameplay and design I want the game to focus more on the characters and telling a fun, whimsical story.\n\nI'm inspired by stuff like the Fellowship of the Ring and the Wizard of Oz, where a mismatched party of adventurers has a quest to go on. I want it to be fairly linear (think Undertale where essentially the whole map is one long line with a few deviations off the main path here and there). The main character is a girl from the ""real world"" who discovers a secret doorway in her closet that takes her to a magical land. Along the way she meets a small group of friends and they travel down a road that takes them to other lands, each with their own theme, on the way to defeat the evil king and his minions who are threatening the world.\n\nLike I said, because of the linear nature of the game, I want to focus more on the dialogue and interactions between the characters, and I want to have interesting situations that each character gets into, and I want each land they visit to be unique with its own subplot and objectives (so one could involve dungeon crawling, one could be a murder mystery, one could involve a war, etc.). Because I want the focus to be on the plot and characters, I don't want the game to be weighed down by a lot of extra mechanics (crafting system, day/night cycle, pet training, etc.) so it will be relatively simple to make.\n\nBasically I want to make a throwback not only to quest-based adventure stories, but classic RPGs. Just wondering what anyone thinks of making something like this in the current age of more complex RPGs."
mtmzxb,A game about fighting your own schizophrenia (FPS/Horror-like),"An example for a level would be you’re at your cubicle doing work and suddenly hallucinations start kicking in. You grab anything around you and can beat the ghostly visions’ asses but occasionally your screen flashes and you see a glimpse of your coworkers. \n\nThere would be more Hallucinations than Co-workers and the only way you could tell the difference is by how the hallucinations are acting, or how the hallucinations look when your screen blinks for a second. So the goal is to defeat all the imaginary threats."
mtmds7,A Strategy/Tactical RPG Game set in Medieval Times...Starring Time Traveling Modern Teenagers,"The general concept is that on the summer after school, around 5-6 teens from our time period find some mystical gem or artifact, and time travel to a High Fantasy Medieval style world. What's worse, they're smack dab in the middle of a war!\n\nThis game could be on whatever console/ device you want. You could tweak or change or remove a lot of the main mechanics that I'm putting here, this is just what came to my mind.\n\n(I'm going to go more into Gameplay details and give small Story Content in-between. If any indie actually does want to pick up this dumb idea this can be changed and molded into whatever)\n\n# Mechanics:\n\n**Out of Combat**\n\n**Phone Battery:** Each teen has a phone with a different amount of max battery at the beginning of the game. One teen has 30%, another 65%, one 100%, you get the gist. You can use the phone to do a myriad of things(Listed in Gameplay section) but every time you use an app, it will use up a certain amount of battery based on what app it was. It will be very small amounts like 1 or 2%, the max amount of battery that can be used for a single app is 20%. \n\nOnce the phone's battery hits 0, that phone is lost forever, and you'll have to use another teen's phone. This means you will have to carefully manage your resources throughout the game to make sure you don't run out.\n\n**Friendship:** Certain units can create a bond with other units. When they are together in battle(Around 2-3 spaces close to each other) they will gain some Friendship. When their Friendship Level Increases, they will gain a Bond. Bonds are skills that only work when both units are in a battle with each other, and even then, have a myriad of other conditions to activate. Hopefully, these could create new strategies in battle.\n\n**In Combat**\n\n**Skills:**  Special Actions that a unit can do. Ranges from attacks that do extra damage, magic, moving an extra number of spaces, etc. Each skill has a cooldown before you can use it again.\n\n**Tactics:** Exclusive to the teens. The teens will try to remember what they learned in medieval warfare to think of the best strategies to use. These can be used to initiate a certain effect based on which you choose. At the start, every teen has access to\n\nAll-Out-Assault: Increases Strength and Magic stats of all ally units for 3 turns by 50%.\n\nHold the Fort:  Increases Defense and Magic Resistance stats of all ally inits for 3 turns by 50%.\n\nYou can gain access to more tactics through the phone command.\n\n**Talk:** Exclusive to teens. Most soldiers wouldn't want to strike up a convo with the enemy, but they sure would love to see what's up with this strange kid with otherworldly clothing and technology. You can activate Talk from up to 3 spaces away. Can be increased. This can be used to talk to other enemies and will give you options to choose from:\n\n*Scare:* Intimidate them via their ignorance and make them leave the battle.\n\n*Trade:* Trade an item that you have for a random item the enemy is carrying(Yes even weapons and armor)\n\n*Distract:* Get an enemy friendly to make them not be able to counterattack for the entire turn your talking to them. Great for setting up kills.\n\n**Improvise:** Exclusive to the teens. Will let them do a variety of actions based on their Ingenuity stat. This also changes based on terrain. Here are a few examples:\n\n*Hide(Grassy Terrain):* Hide near a bush and become invisible for a turn. Enemies will pass you and AI will behave as if you were not there.\n\n*Throw(Anywhere):* Throw any random object you can find at a foe for low damage.\n\n*Grassy Terrain:* Throws a rock up to a distance of 5 spaces around you. Deals minor damage.\n\n*Sandy Terrain:* Throw sand up to a distance of 3 spaces around you. Blinds opponents, lowering their speed by 50%.\n\n*Indoors:* Throw a chair up to a distance of 2 + 1/2 of Strength stat(Rounded up). Deals medium damage.              \n\n**GENERAL GAMEPLAY:**\n\nAt the beginning of every chapter, the main army will be at base camp. This can be a Kingdoms Castle, a nearby village, a caravan, it depends on what happens in the story for each Chapter. There, you can look at your units, customize their gear, and so on.  You can do:\n\n**Exercises:** Drills to train your army or one of the teens in a particular stat and potentially learn more passive skills.\n\n**Check Phone:** Have one of the teens use their very limited battery to check their phone and learn new exercises, skills, or increase stats.\n\n**Shop:** Buy items and equipment from a shop.\n\n**Interrogate:** Convince units captured via a Capture skill of some king to join your cause.(These units will be generics with the same 1 or 2 models/palette. Will have low stats.\n\n**Bond:** Increase two units Friendship with each other.\n\nThe main part of these sections are what the teens can do. Since they transported with their phones and other items, they have much they can offer to the war effort.\n\n**Phone: Check their phones. Their phones have a limited battery that will deplete by a certain amount depending on the app you use. Here the teens can:**\n\n* Learn new *Tactics*\n* Learn new skills\n* Learn new Exercises\n* Increase one of their *Modern* stats. (See *Statistics* for more info.)  \n\nThe Combat section would be similar to the Fire Emblem series. Move around units, kill enemies, make sure no one dies. However now you need to worry about the 5 teens. They all have to be in battle, and if any one of them dies, it's Game Over. \n\nThe Stats could be categorized into 2 different sections. The main ""Combat"" stats that the teens and the other Medieval characters that they come across in the story, and the ""Modern"" stats that only the teens have. First I'll go over combat stats which are pretty simple.\n\n***Statistics***\n\n***Hp:*** How much damage they can take.\n\n***Strength:*** Affects the base strength of physical/weapon attacks.\n\n***Magic:*** Affects the base strength of magic attacks.\n\n***Speed:*** Affects Hit Rate and Evasion Rate.\n\n***Defense:*** Affects how much Physical Damage you take.\n\n***Mag Resistance:*** Affects how much Magical Damage you take.\n\nThe teens are not fully fledged soldiers or magicians, so almost all of them will have extremely low stats in most of the combat stats. Maybe one or two could have maybe below average strength, speed or defense, but they will all have a 0 in Magic or Resistance. What's the point of them then? That's where Modern stats come in!\n\nThe Modern Stats are:\n\n***Knowledge:*** Affects the *Tactics* they can use.\n\n***Medicine:*** Affects potency of using medicinal items\n\n***Language:*** Affects success rate of the *Talk* command\n\n***Ingenuity:*** Affects the actions they can do out of an *Improvise*\n\n  \n***Story Idea Stuff:***\n\nI'm thinking that the teens are gonna have to try to help an army win the war while also trying to figure out how to get back home via the artifacts that they find across their journey. You could even have them time travel to different points in time during the story(Still in the medieval era) and have them see how their actions for this war has consequences. There is a lot you could do with this idea.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, that's all. This whole thing may be terrible, but I think at least some of these mechanics could be cobbled and reformed to make a semi-decent strategy game."
mtli77,"A horror game where instesd of a monster chasing you, it’s just the postal dude asking you to sign his petition",I’m probably not the first one to have this idea but essentially it’s a game like Granny except the “enemy” is just the postal dude trying to make you sign his petition
mtl5xp,A game where there is literally only one button,"Is this stupid? Probably. But hear me out. I was reading about Balan Wonderworld earlier and how you only have one ability button but the ability changes depending on your costume (I think?). I was thinking about that and then I had this idea. So the idea is this: You are playing a game of genre unknown ( I think RTS Into the Breach style or a puzzle game would be best but a platformer would also be pretty cool imo) and you have only one button. You start out with only one ability that happens when you press the button (for example: moving forward). However as you progress you can find more abilities (e.g attack, jump, etc.). But here's the catch: All those abilities have to stay mapped to the same button (for example the A button on an Xbox or X on a PS4). Similar to the wand system in Noita you can drag and drop abilities to reorder when they happen. then you attempt to complete the game. For extra difficulty limit the amount of ability slots the player has so they also have to gather power ups to increase the amount of abilities they can have mapped to the button. Also to keep players from just opening the menu and dragging the currently required ability to the front of the queue: Just keep the game going and proceeding in real time even when the menu is open. So? Whaddya think?"
mtkn76,Yakuza + Werewolf: The Apocalypse = American Dragon City Of Darkness,"An American Dragon game that uses general combat mechanics(excluding stealth) from Werewolf the Apocalypse with the style changing and brawler aspects of the Yakuza games. Another aspect of the game is the Side Missions similar to Miles Morales: Spider Man. It basically goes like this:\n\nStyles:\n\nBrawler Style: An all around style that mainly focuses on using martial arts and countering.\n\nBeast Style: A moveset centered around claw and tail attacks, leaves behind a bleeding effect to combo out of.\n\nWingman Style: Greatly improves on speed of movement and attacks. Includes a Dive Bomb move and various wing based attacks. It also uses a lot of ranged wind blasts.\n\nInferno Style: Uses large AOE Fire attacks and most attacks are unblockable. The downside is that most of these attacks lead to more openings for your opponents. This is one of the most high risk style.\n\nSide Missions: As the American Dragon, Jake has to ensure the safety of the magical community. This aspect of Jake's job is shown through all the side missions you can play through. They range from duking out against magical criminals in a gameplay style similar to Kid Icarus or doing various tasks in your human form. The diversity of these quests would be quite extensive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTwo Player: The Two Player mode would have the option of which type of screen you want for co op and whether you want to do it Offline or Online.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTell me your thoughts about this pitch in"
mtkhyv,Visual Novel except you’re not the main character. And whoever is . . . doesn’t like a happy ending,"I’ve got this idea. The game starts out as a regular cutesy visual novel. You play it thinking you’re the protagonist, but you quickly realize you’re not. Whoever is the real “player” is sadistic and is attempting to break down the other characters in horrifying ways.\nIts your job to keep the characters alive. You do this by having them all become aware that they’re in a game.\nHowever, the game can’t handle this. With you changing it to be sweet and the “player” fighting back the horror, it soon begins to glitch and the psychological horror ensues.\n\nI don’t have much planned yet, but any advice on or any other ideas would be great!"

mtgukr,"A Paint Themed Third Person Looter Shooter, but the loot is paint","Okay, so here’s my idea: this game is a looter shooter about a group of cartoon characters that must fight off an invading army that steals color and muddies it into browns, blacks, grays etc.\n\nHowever, things like weapons and gear aren’t the loot your gathering, but rather differently colored paint. Enemies will drop viles, bottles and buckets colors of differently colored paint, and the paints each have a different effect, and you can either mix identical colors to create stronger ammo of a specific type, or mix different colors to make new ones with a combo of effects (like burning bullets that also stun enemies or ice rounds with increased knock back)."

mtbrha,Massive ultimate online multiplayer military game with multiple playable roles,"In an essence, think of it as a combination of games like Digital Combat Simulator,  FPS games like Tom Clancy's, world of warships, etc.\n\nLet's say you and your friends play together as a team to eliminate some bad guys in another location somewhere in the world. So, some can play as infantry while someone flies the helicopter and other aircrafts such as fighter jets or cargo as pilot,etc. \n\nAnd have different versions of earths as game lobbies, a certain number of people play on earth lobby #1 others play on #2 and so on.\n\nMaybe, the initial few versions can be just be limited to small maps.\n\nBut the game should also have atleast a decent level of realism, physics (especially aircraft and ships; DCS has a good level of realism and physics), procedures, etc.\n\nCreating such a game would require years of making, tons of money, experienced experts in many fields and just about an insane amount of resources. It would be the ultimate culmination of fps gamers, flight simulation community and others.\n\nThere's already a lot of people in these communities and I think some may have also had a thought of such a game. \nJust imagine csgo, R6 alone have such a huge community and what would happen if we combined them. \n\nIt would surely get the attention of everyone cause there has never been such a game ever!(One of a kind) And this concept also has huge potential for revenue generation.\n\nIf someone does make this into a real game in the future please let me know!"

mtadlq,continue my idea pls,So i have an idea of a cop in a small village ([https://drive.google.com/file/d/1n7k1zlGCiXvsCfXSCLwuMbPaCW7OuSNS/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1n7k1zlGCiXvsCfXSCLwuMbPaCW7OuSNS/view?usp=sharing)). In every house he needs to do a task (a task is just a simple 2D game). If he finished the tasked successfully he gets a piece of a radio transmitter that is broken. If he gets all the pieces he can fix the radio transmitter to call a boat to pick him up. The problem is that the theme is kinda cowboy village and i don't know any fun tasks that he can do. Can you help me out? BTW the task needs to be in 2D else the game would be too complicated for me
mt9qnv,A new type of vigilante game,"I think games where you play as superheros and vigilantes are cool. But you are stuck in the same situation almost every time. Either you have something like infamous where your new to the hero/villian stuff and your character is created based on your choices. Or you have games like batman where you are a well established hero and you just follow whatever has been created for you. But what if you had full control over your character, you customize your suit and hideout, and choose whether you are a hero or villian. But you also have to make some form of commitment to your characters day life whether it be actually playing or choosing from a list of options to see what kind of job you work to see how you make the money to afford your little ""hobbie"" and what kind of connections you make with people. The best way I could imagine this being done is having an option to free room as your casual self to meet up with people and use your connections to benefit yourself in your hero form. If something like this exists and its not some dinky online game please let me know, otherwise I would like to hear people thoughts in this idea and possible elaboration."

mt573k,Sid Meier s Pirates / Uncharted Waters / Atlas - historical hybrid,"A historical multiplayer survival and building sand box with the Caribbean and South American coastlines with the world map view similar to Sid Meier s Pirates , the alliances and politics and sea myths of Uncharted Waters Online and the sandbox , crafting ,taming and open world qualities of Atlas. The islands and land would be totally explorable as open world , the navigation on sea would have a world map like Sid Meier s Pirates or Uncharted Waters Online for long distance voyages to eliminate the long hours of sailing in Atlas but there would be no instant teleportation with ships.\n\nAlso the option to go out of world map and into first or third person view and see your ship in third person while you sail anytime you want for when something of interest is happening ,maybe some things are only visible while in first or third person views only , whenever you sail in first or third person view the speed of the ship would be as realistic as possible. Sea battles or Sailing in ports would always be first or third person.\n\nEvery company/guild in server would have to choose an alliance to a historical country like in Uncharted Waters were you have England , Spain , France , Holland , Portugal or more. Players would be also able to just go rogue and become pirates with its advantages and disadvantages. The World map would have a power and influence map to show the results of the player driven actions deciding which nations are doing best and the more influence your nation of origin has the more benefits your guild gets. It would have solid system in place to make sure all nations have the same amount of players more or less on server.

Your guild s name would also take points in some short of hall of fame for influence in your nation and also as formidable foe in your enemies hall of fame. The territory region of every nation would have a starting area for each nation that can never be wiped out but other regions could be won or lost depending on guilds/companies winning , surrendering or being wiped.

This would make it possible to have boss fights in Atlas and Ark styles but keep it as realistic as possible with mythological and legends that make sense into the game but general tone of the game and events would always be historical. Uncharted Waters online manages to do this. The mythological creatures should not be common , actually they should be just boss fights maybe or just very rare to encounter. Also having passive random events like a ghost sighting or similar lure at some places in certain times that would also be rare to encounter that would give a slight mystical feel to the game sometimes. There would be different types of horses , farm animals , pets etc for taming all with their strengths for farming or fighting and also wild animals that roam the map that you can hunt or tame for resources.\n\nIt would be cool to have such a game were History and Sandbox come together in an age of sail , exploration and colonial setting with a hint of myth It would satisfy the itch of many people with various tastes in my opinion."
mt551w,If Sid Meier's Pirates/ Uncharted Waters / Atlas hybrid Survival Game,"A historical multiplayer survival and building sand box with the Caribbean and South American coastlines with the world map view similar to Sid Meier s Pirates , the alliances and politics and sea myths of Uncharted Waters Online and the sandbox , crafting ,taming and open world qualities of Atlas. The islands and land would be totally explorable as open world , the navigation on sea would have a world map like Sid Meier s Pirates or Uncharted Waters Online for long distance voyages to eliminate the long hours of sailing in Atlas  but there would be no instant teleportation with ships.\n\nAlso the option to go out of world map and into first or third person view and see your ship in third person while you sail anytime you want for when something of interest is happening ,maybe some things are only visible while in first or third person views only , whenever you sail in first or third person view the speed of the ship would be as realistic as possible.  Sea battles or Sailing in ports would always be first or third person.\n\nEvery company/guild in server would have to choose an alliance to a historical country like in Uncharted Waters were you have England , Spain , France , Holland , Portugal or more. Players would be also able to just go rogue and become pirates with its advantages and disadvantages. The World map would have a power and influence map to show the results of the player driven actions deciding which nations are doing best and the more influence your nation of origin has the more benefits your guild gets. It would have solid system in place to make sure all nations have the same amount of players more or less on server.

mswu5a,Fully modular world,"Hello, I'm an intermediate game developer looking for ideas and I want your opinion on it.\n\nA game where the player can fully customize the world, himself and weapons. Player starts as a wizard with nothing but a simple wand, but thru defeating monsters in an open world can obtain attributes to change different things from the world structure and weather to improving its own body and weapons. But every change can lead to an outcome, for example changing the season leads to evolved and different monsters and messing with the world structure (changing its composition, changing physics...) could anger non aggressive npcs.\n\nI'm imagining a top down 3D  (mostly because I don't have any 2D experience) cubic based world with some survival mechanics like the ability to craft some attributes for the weapons. The weapon modification system would be similar to Noita's spell system where you can customize wands projectiles, their characteristics and etc. but with an emphasis on combining several weapons to maximize their different reactions.\n\nThe world would be randomly generated with random already existing attributes so every play-through would be different."
msvkzu,An action rpg game where you’re a mummy necromancer,"Feel free to use this idea.\n\nI envision an action rpg where you’re an ancient Egyptian mummy (undead) trained in necromancy.  Your attributes and skills would parallel those in Dungeons &amp; Dragons, and your skills would be similar to the necromancer in Diablo 2.  As you kill enemies (which replenish over time), you gain experience, go up in levels, and master new skills. You would wake up in an ancient tomb, and fight off other undead, as well as creatures from another universe. Later, you would tunnel down into caves deep below the Earth, far lower than a living human could go.  Your mission takes you miles under the surface of the Earth, and darkness is a key element of the game, similar to Diablo 1.  Eventually, you battle the living brain that commands the undead and the other creatures.  After killing it, the end of the game depends on your alignment.\n\nStory: The game is set in modern times. Scientists begin experimenting with Interdimensional travel, and inadvertently open up a portal to another universe. Strange beings emerge, and they travel far underground, where they bring the dead back to life as undead, which begin an assault on humanity.  You play the role of the mummy. Waking up in a buried ancient Egyptian tomb, you have no memory of your ancient life, aside from your knowledge of necromancy. Early on in the game, you encounter the demon lord Orcus. He gives you your memory back, and reveals his plan. You learn that you were an evil necromancer in ancient Egypt, and have spent the past 3192 years in Hell. Orcus has brought you back so that you can defeat the interdimensional beings, seize control of the undead that are ravaging the surface, and lead them to victory over the humans. He wants an undead world, and you will be his puppet ruler. At this point, you can choose your alignment:\n\nGood - You decide that this is a new beginning, and want to make up for past mistakes. You fight to save humanity.\n\nNeutral - You reject Orcus’ plan, but you don’t really identify with humans either. You plan to defeat the Interdimensional beings only so that you can live in peace far beneath the Earth.\n\nEvil - Accepting your true self, you commit yourself to Orcus’ plan, and long to rule over an undead world as emperor!\n\nThe ending depends on your alignment:\n\nGood - After seizing control of the undead, you drive their souls out of their bodies, forcing them to return to the afterlife.  All over the world, the undead collapse, and humanity is saved.  You at last depart your body, and your soul ascends to Heaven, having been forgiven by God.\n\nNeutral - After defeating the enemy, you can rest underground and live in peace. The undead still attack humans on the surface, but with their leadership shattered, humans have a better chance of survival in this new era.\n\nEvil - When you seize control of the undead, you lead them to victory over the humans.  The Age of the Dead has begun, and you, Emperor Decrepus, shall rule over them for all time!  Earth will become an outpost of Hell!\n\nMummy (D &amp; D) : [https://dandwiki.com/wiki/Mummy\_(5e\_Race)](https://dandwiki.com/wiki/Mummy_(5e_Race))\n\n[https://i.pinimg.com/originals/88/33/83/883383e03702c7c33c814287709a2d52.jpg](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/88/33/83/883383e03702c7c33c814287709a2d52.jpg)"
mssw1f,Interactive Story that determines your life,"Before anyone rolls their eyes, yes I was thinking it could be in the style of Life is Strange, Beyond Two Souls, Heavy Rain, etc. but I realize this is an indie thread so a renpy style could work too. \n\nI had an idea of what if the story starts with your character dying in some way that could of been prevented. (a car crash while under the influence? Murdered?) and you end up fighting for your second chance at life in the purgatory world, or whatever ‘realm’ the waiting one is that determines if you go to heaven or hell. Or? What if you have to do a multitude of ‘tasks’ to prove you’re worthy of a second chance at life. The decisions you make eventually determine your outcome of spending the rest of eternity in the after life or being able to hit a “reset” button on life and wake up from this coma your character is in and have no memories of how hard you fought to get that opportunity. It’s like a deal with fate. \n\nI apologize for this sounding scrambled and probably unoriginal. But maybe somebody will somewhat understand what I’m trying to get at. I’m not the best at explaining my thought process. I was hoping the whole point of the game is for the main character to realize their mistakes they’ve made on life and how it’s impacted not only themselves, but others around them. Causing their death, and maybe even someone else’s."

msmek8,Age of Empires? How about Age of Dots?,"I was a big fan of the Age of Empires games throughout the years growing up. Even though the games themselves grew in complexity throughout the years, there was always something very satisfying about how simple the mechanics were in the first game. There have been a lot of games that resemble this style but just haven't captured the execution simplicity. (They eventually remastered it which made me very happy.)\n\nThis idea is something I have been grappling with for a while now. I really wanted to use it as a way to break into game development, but I'm having trouble figuring out where to start based on how I want it played.\n\nThe idea of the game is to take the concept of the simple 2D IO games and combine it with the mechanics of Age of Empires. The workers/citizens/troops would be team colored dots, trees triangles, buildings squares shapes, etc. Very simple, flat, 2D design to allow for massive scale battles and multiplayer battles. Each team has a color. Each map and its resources are randomly generated on start. Zoom in and out to see world/factions.\n\nI want varied troop creation (maybe different altered shapes), civilization upgrades (changes in color palette), and a zoomable world map with massive PvP/PvC campaigns.\n\nTheres a lot to build on this idea, but the general idea is to STAY SIMPLE and keep things scalable.\n\nLet me know what you think, or better yet, go build this if you think its a good idea and keep me in the loop.\n\nP.S. After a quick google search, I found that AOE falls under the ""Historical Real-time Strategy"" category."
msmbx3,Zombie apocalypse but they’re smart,"So, imagine zombies that are hungry for brains, but instead of roaming around randomly they can communicate, use guns, farm humans, build tools, form organized armies...\n\nThere could also be the brainless beasts so common in the genre, but they’d be dominated by the smarter zombies who would use them as their frontline, entertainment or whatever.\n\nIntelligence would make them way scarier! Also, transmission wouldn’t happen with a bite, are you still living in 2019 or what, it’s airborne transmission or no deal!"

IDK, I just want a cute RPG with anthropomorphic animals and a town that grows with you the longer that you play, with some customization options as well!"
msli1f,Godzilla pvp,"Alright I'm going to pitch a video game idea I had in a dream,\n\nGODZILLA: ULTIMATUM.\n\nThe game takes place in New York and will be a semi open world pvp/pve experience. You will either take the role of godzilla or over 40 different civilians after a radiation leak gave them unique and ever randomized effects.\nThe game once again would be co op and offline if desired for practice because you will only have 2 lives per game.\nWill there be a story? Yes. The story in my mind is godzilla came from the ocean and demolished a newly built nuclear power plant of of the coast of Wagner Park, you will have a branching story line of three different outcomes. monster (godzilla), human (pacifists), beast (bloodletter).\nThe monster position will help godzilla when needed to defend against the corporation who put the nuclear power plant on Manhattan.\nMore ideas soon."

mshpku,Call of Gruty?,"This post isn't serious in the slightest. I'm thinking of it as an FPs where you play as Gru and use his freeze-ray to trap enemies. Knowing that Gru is 14 feet tall, there could be a 2-hit combo mechanic where Gru freezes an opponent and then punches them, breaking the ice (and them). After you complete the FPS campaign of going throughout the Despicable Me city causing GTA-V level mayhem, you finally face off against the final boss: Vector, on the Moon. After you beat Vector by freezing him and allowing him to die in space and float away, you return to Earth and unlock Dr. Nefario as a character, where you use the Fart Gun to the same effect as the freeze-ray, but rather than trapping enemies in ice, it traps enemies in a stun (like the stink bomb in Bully/Canis Canem Edit). It's FPS and Freeroam, a lot like RDR2."
msgljw,The Matrix Online 2.0,"Gta online version of a matrix video game. \n\nit would be a prequel to the movies.\n\nyou can activate slow motion like in the max payne 3 multiplayer. anyone entering the slow mo bubble would also go into slow motion. this prevents players on the other side of the map from randomly entering slow motion because someone activated it. this youtube video explains it [https://youtu.be/Px\_TF7D2OEg](https://youtu.be/Px_TF7D2OEg)\n\nyou can activate slow mo when driving for better car handling. \n\njump on top of an 18 wheeler, activate slowmo and dive off of the top and shoot agents. \n\ngameplay is a combo of max payne 3, gta and enter the matrix gameplay. you can wall run, dive, etc.\n\nhand to hand combat is like mad max/batman games. \n\ncustomize your character, vehicles, weapons, apartment, etc. \n\ntakes place in an earlier version of the matrix, thus you can't do certain things like spawn unlimited ammo and guns, because it hasn't been figured out. this is just to prevent plot holes, because in the film, Morpheus is able to spawn an unlimited amount of weapons when he is showing neo the matrix. It would also explain why you see a forcefield around someone activating slowmo. \n\nIt would be cool if wb games made this."

msfk0w,FPS where the only weapon is a revolver with multiple type of ammunitions,"# Core idea\n\nSo I was thinking that a cool mechanic that we haven't still seen yet would be to have an fps with only a revolver as a weapon and as the core mechanic being the fact that there would be many different types of ammunitions that you can chamber in each slot as you see fit ( for example ammo type A in the 1st 3rd and 5ft chamber and ammo type B in the other 3), this would create a customizable pattern of combat given a good range of options, let me give you some examples of what effects these special bullets could have:\n\n# Examples\n\nExample 1:\n\nIn the first chamber the player puts a bullet that deals less damage but breakes the armor of the enemy that it hits, following the first shot the player fires the second chamber containing a bullet that deals a high ammount of damage to unarmored targets so that the first bullet opens up damage potential on the enemy and the second one delivers a bigger punch than it would on it's own\n\nExample 2:\n\nA bullet (calling this one ""**primer**"" for clarity) that when shot on an enemy doesn't deal damage but sticks to the surface and if shot with a second type, it explodes in an area applying the effect of the bullet it was shot with, like, the primer gets shot with an incendiary bullet and it explodes setting all the nearby enemies on fire.\n\nExample 3:\n\nA nice thing would be to also have combos that involve more than 2 bullets, for example shooting an enemy with an incendiary bullet that ignites the target, then shooting a primer followed by a chain lightning bullet (a litteral lightning shot from the barrel of the revolver that can't hit weak spots but bounces of to the nearest enemy and applies the debuffs of the first target to the second) that, on impact makes the primer explode, hitting with lightning multiple enemies AND setting them on fire.\n\n# Mechanic management\n\nNow that I've given some examples on the workings of some bullets, let's talk about how the player could choose how to set up the bullet order:\n\nThe best way to do this system justice would be in my opinion, to have a menu where you choose what bullet goes in what chamber creating a configuration that everytime you reload, the bullets would default to the order chosen in the first place, for example:\n\n(I will use only letters in place of the bullets to shorten the description)\n\n|Chamber 1|Chamber 2|Chamber 3|Chamber 4|Chamber 5|Chamber 6|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Bullet A|Bullet B|Bullet C|Bullet B|Bullet A|Bullet D|\n\nYou empty the mag and when you reload you'll find the same types of bullets in the same order as before.\n\nI'll write a bunch of bullet ideas just for fun below:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n| Shepherd |Bullet that when shot on a target, all the subsequent bullets home in on the target|\n|:-|:-|\n|Frost Bite|Ice bullet that chills the area that it hits making affected pieces of armor brittle and slowing the movement of the enemy hit|\n|Convergenge|Shoots a sphere that slowly floats forward following the direction of the crosshair, when shot with other bullets it stores them inside and when the player reloads the sphere explodes causing the effect of all the bullets in an area.|\n|Blood leacher |Bullet that deals no damage on impact but hooks on the target and makes it constantly spill blood for X ammount of time, if the target dies during this period the player regains health|\n|Nailer|Bullet that has the highest knock back potential and if the knock back of this bullet pushes an enemy to a wall it pins the target to the surface for X ammount of time|\n|Inexorable |Bullet that debuffs an enemy with a death mark, if a second enemy gets this debuff in any way, all the damage that the first target takes is also applied to the second.|\n|Flusher|Bullet that when shot causes all the remaining shots to be fired in a shotgun rose pattern emptying the mag with a lot of power but low accuracy and range.|\n\nThanks for your time and let me know what you think!"
msfbco,I feel like this has already been done. But here goes...,"It would be a platforming type game but it's interacting with your desktop. So basically like how you can manipulate files and such in OneShot except your character can also interact with windows you have open and use them as platforms. Perhaps interact with stuff within those windows as well?  But the point is to create a garden and just kind of grow your garden and collect plants. No enemies, nothing. Just some platforming aspects and calmingness. Maybe if the calm and zen garden stuff isn't for you use this idea: You are a little person within the computer who must execute tasks that we normally do within our computer. For example unpinning an app from the taskbar. But it's not as easy as that because you have to avoid enemies(?) and so on and so forth. I don't know how hard it would be to actually make that and so far  i haven't found a way to on the internet so I'll tag it intermediate. If you do know how to make this game please leave a comment telling me how to or telling me that you did. Thanks!"

msdbvs,"This is the game backstory I made in about a day or 2 IDK if it's good no stealing it plz but what u guys think? should I add something? also, the game is an fps, and it's like destiny and destiny 2.","Name of game-the darkness within → The world was infected by darkness in a lab called techtron labs on every planet. Researchers were working on a mysterious orb that fell from space(as people were told). As they work they find out it's very dangerous and needs to be disposed of. Inside the orb is a parasite that feeds on people's happiness and moral judgment (it makes people insane). What they didn't account for was that destroying it would release an unstoppable particle of the symbiote. This creature had infected everyone on the planet. First, there was the stage of losing their ability to have feelings then they had an urge to kill then in the final stage they had no recollection of who they were. The survivors call them psychists. There were few people who survived the chaos but there is a reason they weren't affected. These people were already insane or had no feelings. These people were already crazy in some way or there were the lucky ones. They had not been affected because they were immune. They were able to have no symptoms and survived those who were immune were called the elected. They had been chosen to take part in research in trying to find a cure for what they called the darkness. Little did they know the darkness wasn't the bad guy, it was the survivors. The planets were chosen to take part in this experiment to see if people were worthy of being alive but not for earth. The experiment came from techtron labs. There was a secret government operation that techtron labs had planned. They would send a made symbiote to every planet to see if life on the planet was morally good or bad. If they became insane they were good but if they didn't they had no effect. The people who survived would be known as the killers of the world. The people who survived had experienced powers, an effect that no one expected not even the living scientists. Knowing that, they try to create more symbiotic creatures and send them into an advanced portal in one of their labs. The portal leads to a place where they colonize and the infection spreads. This area is called the shadow realm. After the attack, the people who gained powers split into groups based on their powers. There were 4 groups: the warrior, the assassin, the brute, and the wizard. Their powers were based on their levels of psychosis. The warrior doesn't stop killing people but they do hesitate on who. They are known to be brave and strong but also feared and in this sense crazy. Then the assassin will kill anyone and not care. They have no morals and don't care who they kill. They will do anything that includes injuring someone even if it's a joke. Then the brute who will rip anyone in half doesn't care about anything and is only in it for themselves. They value strength and have no judgment. Lastly, the wizards are the elected and they are immune but at the same time, they don't care about people. They are distant and they are most likely lonely. They act normal though. All regular weapons in the world are transformed by the blast into magical weapons. Techtron labs has many facilities and are known as the first to bring us to space travel by a 6 pilot spacecraft. They also created the unlimited power thruster engine using lava canisters. This was a big thing for us because it brought new metals and elements. It also brought new capabilities in weapon technology and telecommunication. This allowed people to talk from planet to planet. It also created travel in other forms. Some scientists had finished creating the first-ever teleportation circle. You step in one end and come out another end. This had been changed into a second portal to the shadow realm due to the symbiote infecting the electronics. This had been unknown (till the player finds it) to people that this would be the first portal to another part of the universe and is really a part of another solar system. Which means the second form of interplanetary travel in other universes. We discovered 2 new planets that were made we call vb1734 and another called planet volcanock due to its volcanic activity. This is later shown up in the world a lot because people have obviously explored them. Volcanock is known as a lava mining site due to techtron labs extracting lava-like we extracted oil. This allowed people to have more jobs and for new weapons to be formed within the canisters. Using a molding method where they freeze the lava and use lasers to cut out the shape. This was hard to do because sometimes if not done properly the weapon would crumble into pieces. After the molding is done then they add some of our old minerals and some of the new ones found. This then hardens the lava so it won't crumble to pieces after they are done they add detail and some electronics and the gun is completed. This was both a lab/factory and a research station/mining facility. Then on planet vb1734, there was another lab but this lab was burned in an accident which was then being rebuilt before the explosion. The building was never finished and the lab was left stranded. (until the player finds it then they find a dungeon and a free gun.) The planet was a secret no one knew about. Only one person had a map. (the person dies in a fire.) and the map was split into pieces. On 4 microchips was put 1 map piece each. The map pieces were then scattered on the earth, Mars, Neptune, and mercury but never made it far. Techtron labs had created many new creatures, The shadow keeper which was a keeper of the shadow realm. The shadow turrets which is a ball that had 2 balls orbiting it. The shadow crawlers which would run at you then attach to your face and poison you. The shadow worm which will burrow underground then pops up and hits you. The spikers which are spikey creatures that would shoot you with their darkness balls. The runers will walk and explode into a small rune that would suck you into it taking damage. The shadow zombies which were unlucky dead people brought back by the symbiote. The ghosts are pretty simple to explain on their own. All of these creatures have one thing in common they want to kill. \n\nMy question is do you think techtron labs will succeed in their evil plot to end the world or will we find out and stop them? Will we have a hero or villain as the main character, and will you ever beat the game?"

ms9t2y,A game where you play as Nosferatu,"It would not be open-world but at least hub-based (like for example Dragon Age Inquisition or Dishonored)\n\n**General info:** Set somewhere in the 1800s, you play as Nosferatu himself. The setting could be in Romania and you could later unlock (like in the movie) Germany, where there could be variable towns and areas.\n\n**Story:** I suppose that following the movies' story would limit the game a lot, but it could borrow some elements for sure. It could predate the movie's story, before Thomas Hutter went to meet Count Orlok, or better it could totally disregard the movie's plot to make one of its own, where as Nosferatu you try to seize control over the Carpathians, while civilians and some sort of army tries to kill ""the vampire"" that infests the area, but no one knows it's Count Orlok who is really the vampire.\n\n**Gameplay:** The idea behind the game is that it's a third person action RPG, but a lot more sophisticated. It will play a lot like the Batman Arkham Series where hiding and instilling fears in your opponents is key. Also some ideas from Dishonored (again) could be used, like the abstract quest system, and the overall traversal around the areas that allows for freedom of approaches. By killing enemies in open combat you can unlock combat skills, and by being stealthy and drinking the enemies' blood would make Nosefratu stronger and unlock a different tiers of skills that have to do with stealth and transforming into animals.\n\nAlso it could have a main hub like the Styx games where you collect your powers and rest, as well as upgrade your vampiric powers, as well as customize the castle. \n\nTransforming into animals would have its uses, like for example transforming into a bat would allow you to reach high places, and also infiltrate houses and spy upon enemies and civilians. Transforming into a rat could allow you to enter homes and sewers too. Maybe also transforming into a canine would allow you to ""befriend"" people and make them approach you to pet you. There would be a lot of approaches for different scenarios\n\nAn interesting mechanic would be the day and night cycle. At night you are at the most powerful, but as the dawn approaches, Nosferatu would become weaker, and if you are caught outside at day, you soon die. So you have to enter the sewers, or enter a building to protect yourself from the sunlight. Drinking blood makes you somewhat resistant for a limited time, but not much.\n\n**Music:** My personal opinion on music is that it should be reminiscent of the old movie of 1922, with some horror abstract music as well. Screechy violins, moody strings and a genera sense of old school horror.\n\n**Graphics:** They don't need to be state of the art graphics, but they need to have very good reflections and lighting mechanics. Murky waters on the streets, the moonlight passing through clouds, trees and buildings, and the patrols' torches illuminating have to look almost artistic. An extra would be that you can play the game in a sepia or black and white mode (like Ghost of Tsushima did)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's all so far. I am an avid horror fan, and for me Nosferatu is by far the most horrifying and grotesque monster of the older films."
ms8sfq,"A dangerous checkpoint racing game on extremely open courses; when the checkpoint is reached, its replaced with a new checkpoint somewhere randomly ahead on the track. This leads to everyone still behind to cut off-road across the track to reach the newest checkpoint first.","* The track is relatively safe &amp; simple. Driving *off* the track is tricky and dangerous.\n* The circuits have tons of curves and bends, and you can go as far off course to get to the next checkpoint (or if you are really far behind, further ahead where the next checkpoint might spawn).\n* Cars take damage that can affect performance. If you're driving off-track, you'll be assuming many more risks.\n* Reaching a checkpoint awards 1 point. First player reach the point limit wins.\n\nI'm going to be honest: I never played Midnight Club Racing, but from what I barely remember this might be how it played? Let me know if this is true. I mean the part about a checkpoint disappearing and spawning somewhere else as soon as someone reaches it. Personally I imagined something more like Star Wars Pod Racer or F-Zero in which the vehicles are fast and fragile, except you don't have to stick to the track at all."

Half-charged means you can slow down, and fully charged means you can freeze time around you for 5 seconds.

What kind of obstacles could I add? Should I add more enemies and so on.."
ms31b7,How would you design/replace cappy in super mario odyssey?,"You were just instructed to create some sort of core mechanic for super mario odyssey. It has to tie in with the capture mechanic, which was already established.\n\nRules:\n\nYou can’t just copy cappy from the existing game\n\nIt has to tie in with Mario’s character design (no giving him a battle axe) and also needs to be able to work for all costumes\n\nIt should aid in movement and combat, and be ranged to hit enemies easier.\n\nShould aid multiple problems at once.\n\nShould be able to be used anywhere (no grapple points) and should not use a 3rd person aiming system like splatoon or fortnite.\n\n(This is just a thought experiment to see how people would do things differently)"

mrolxo,Snake Battle Royal.,The classic game Snake should get the 100 player treatment in the same way Pacman or Tetris did. \n\nSeems like it would be fun to try and cut off other players while trying to collect body segments to make your self longer.

mrk2nu,Red dead 3 concept,"Ive had this idea for a while but never had a place to tell anyone about it until now, also thinking of starting a petition till rockstar notices....hopefully..\n\nAnyways, the rdr3 conept.\nWe had cowboys, twice now. We had many gta's (aka gangs and mobsters, and prob more in the future) so... Why not pirates?\n\nI mean, i think it could work right? with dutch and the gang already going to tahiti (or getting stranded on that island), its possible that pirates could be a thing in the same universe not to mention all the pirate related easter eggs in rdr2 AND 1, just imagine how cool it would be to drive a boat/ship across the sea, or even riding a horse on land with a gang of pirates, catching deep sea wildlife, preforming robberys in whatever cool outfit you had. Etc etc.\n\nAnd it would be so easy to connect the other 2 games before it. Maybe even a story mission where you and your pirate gang go to blackwater.\n\nSo, as simple as it may sound rn, what do you guys think, should i start a petition or something so ""MAYBE"" rockstar wil notice?"

mri9u9,Random Game Idea,"Game Title: The Courier\n\nStory Plot: Not much of a plot, but here; It's World War 3 and Nuclear weapons are practically waiting to be fired, so armies fight overseas to take control of the enemy's Nuclear missile controls. You play as the Courier, a marine spec ops unit that carries large packages of ammo, weapons, and other gadgets around a hostile environment to operatives and squad camps. You survive in a hostile land carrying packages dodging animals and enemies.\n\nGameplay: Taking a lot from Death Stranding, you carry several packages with various items in them to their destination. The more you pack onto yourself, the harder it is to keep the characters balance and the more damaged the packages become, lowering your overall score and reward. You can also run into wild animals and hostile enemies, who will attack you. With some upgrades, you can use a taser, pistols, or grenades to stun or kill enemies, flares, flashbangs, or whistles to scare off animals. You can't kill a lot of animals because you'd then get hit with a fine for animal cruelty unless you do something like throwing a dead deer to a lion to escape, that's fine."

mqwnl0,An olen world jjba: golden wind based game.,"So, as I said, it's only a based game, it does not have to be anime-styled. So, i will say things unorganized, because it just popped in my head, i didn't plan it out at all. So, you would play in Italy. At the start of the game you could play as a human or a stand master. You would spawn randomly somewhere in Italy. You would have to live your life normally throughout the whole game. Make money, Have somewhere to live, eat, maybe have families, e.t.c. But you somehow would get involved in the Passione (or whatever the gang would be named). For example getting high reputation or like in the anime, you would need to get in contact with Polpo. Then you would join a gang, or if your reputation is high enough, make your own. There would be gangs (By the way it's a multiplayer game), and you would need to get higher and higher reputation to climb the gang leaderboard untill you are the boss. Either you could befriend the boss, or overthrow him. (The boss would be a player too) The boss could control Italy through the gangs. You would need to gain reputation in secret, so the police can't tell what's going on. When you get in jail, you could either wait or break out. This game would be half roleplay, half normal game. I know, the explanation is very rough, but I hope at least some of you get my idea. Also, there would of course be a lot of things bad in this idea, but it just popped in my imagination, also if it would exist, probably they would be solved somehow. Have a great day everyone!"

mqp043,Coop game that is based around running a space ship,"After playing the board game ""Space Alert"" and the video game ""Faster than light"" I had the idea for a (local) coop game where you and your friends are a crew on a space ship running missions while trying to keep the ship in one piece. \n\nThe main screen is a floor map of the ship. There are several rooms in the ship that have different purposes. You have the bridge where you can navigate the ship and fight space battles, an engineering room where you have to keep fueling the reactor for maneuvering and firing the lasers.\n\nEvery thing is displayed from a top-down perspective and players move their figures around on the ship.\n\nOne requirement I have for the game is that it has to be playable as local multiplayer.\nThis is where the problem lies.\nOn one side you want to be able to walk around the ship and do the different tasks during battle but the battle mechanics should also be interesting. You should be able to select targets, fly maneuvers and so on. But the map of the ship has always be in the front of the players to walk around, feed the reactor, repair damage etc. That means a battle view screen or something like that won't be possible as it would obstruct the view for the other players inside the ship. \n\nDoes anyone have a good idea how to combine a sophisticated battle system while still being able to walk around the ship?"
mqojtj,2 vs 6 Turn-based Horror multiplayer game,"CONCEPT  \n\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \nIn this Horror game There are 2 ""chasers"" and 6 ""slayers"" The chasers goal is to kill the slayers and the slayers need to kill the chasers before they get to the slayers. \n\nAt the start of the game you can choose a character based on what side you are on. if you are on the chasers side you choose the chasers. If you are on the slayers side you choose one of the slayers. \n\nThe chasers and slayers will be spread around a large to medium sized map. They will be put at random spot around the map there is a lot of fog of war to deal with. For slayers their task will have a marker in the direction but not fully highlighted to them until they get in their view range. When chasers get into a slayers area the slayer will hear Slaughter noise, the slaughter noise is different for each chaser. \n\nEach slayer has a different task before they are able to kill the chasers. The slayers main goal is to get a ""god weapon"" to kill the chasers. Before they get the ""god weapon"" they do very minimal damage to the chasers. Each slayer has a skill, They can be from healing other slayers health bar to tanking damage for an ally to slowing the hunter down. While in war mode each slayer gets abilities based on their ""skill"" and weapons. \n\nAnd each chaser has specials abilities to help them kill and hunt down the slayers. \n\nThe game is played based on a timer, you put your movement and actions in and when the timer reaches 0 all players turns will play out at the same time. if 2 slayers are on the same tile one of them will move (random). if a chaser and slayer are on the same tile or a slayer enters a chasers attack range They will enter war mode. (treat the normal game like a top or side down view while war mode is like for the king type battle) This is where slayers and chasers can kill each other. During war mode all players in the game are running of the timer still but players in war mode will have a different set of actions. Players in war mode place an action (they can attack, use skills, abilities, and Run away) these attacks are all based on a 20 sided dice, if the dice is below 5 the attack will miss, if its between 5 and 10 the attack will do 50% less damage than normal, if the roll is between 10 and 15 the attack will do its normal damage, if the attack is between 15 and 19 the attack will do 15% more damage, if the roll is 20 it will do 50% more damage. Supportive actions and running away will at be done on a normal dice 1-2 will miss, 3-4 will do normal amount, 5-6 will do extra running away will only work if its 5-6. Allies can join in the battle if they are in range of the chaser or slayer.  \n\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \nART SYTLE DIRECTION\n\nThe art and animation style will be very fluid.   Very dark and spooky with a scary music and sound theme.  \nThe game will go form top down view to a battle like for the king type battle.\n\nI would love to hear anybody's thoughts ik this is long so if you take the time out of you day to read this thank you so much! i would love to expand on this idea!"

l0wds5,Post-apocalyptic game where you scavenge procedurally-generated abandoned houses for supplies and in the process get a glimpse into the lives of the people who used to live there,"You play as one of the few survivors of an apocalyptic event that wiped out most of humanity, wandering around a deserted city trying to scavenge supplies to keep yourself alive against the threats of the post-apocalyptic world.\n\nWhat makes the game stand out is that the supplies are found by breaking into any of the (hundreds of? thousands of?) long-abandoned houses and apartments in the city, whose insides are all procedurally generated. While you are searching the rooms you catch small glimpses of the lives of the people who once lived there: a family picture with one of the faces scratched out, a diary hidden under the daughter's bed, an engraved wedding ring on top of a dresser, a grave for the family dog in the backyard.\n\nThe exact nature of the apocalypse and the threats you need to face can be anything: weather, zombies, monsters, etc. They are mostly there to add challenge and give you an incentive to go scavenging inside the houses, and to create a contrast between your character's present life and the lives of the people who lived there before.\n\nOf course, the game would rely heavily on the writing and on the procedure for randomly generating the houses, which would have to avoid repetition and strive for some degree of realism. It would be nice to have some variety between houses in terms of previous inhabitants: families, couples, single parents, bachelors, elderly people, people of different economic backgrounds. Ideally there should also be some interconnectedness between different elements within the same house; for example, in the house with the dog's grave in the backyard the daughter's diary might include the day her parents brought the dog home for the first time. There could also be interconnectedness between neighboring houses; for example, an engraved wedding ring matching the one on the dresser might be found on the floor of their next-door neighbor's bedroom, indicating that they were having an affair."
l0urp5,"Horror, Action game","I have had this idea for quite a while now and I only really think about it while I am walking my dog.\n\nMy game idea is a Single player / Multiplayer game based in a small rural village. There will be A runner and 2 or 3 farmers (the chasers) I have not thought of the main objective but the goal will be to access something inside one of the 3 farms. \n\nAs the runner you will have to collect weapons, food and other general supplies. You will have to hide and most importantly, run from the farmers. You would be fast and weak.\n\nAs the farmer you will have to find the Runner, you will be big and strong but slow, there is a chance of having a quad bike, you must track down the runner and catch or kill them, you could set traps or distractions. The 3 Farmers could either work together to catch the runner, or they could work alone.\n\nThe runner would have to remain quiet and would have to leave clue to where they are, they can hide in houses, sheds, inside a school or in the woods. Their resources would be limited, limited ammo, limited food and water, limited storage, you get the point. Looting houses or shops would be almost essential so you could not spend the whole game hiding. The runner would have to be careful. Footsteps can be heard. Tracks can be followed, and any lights you leave on or doors you leave open can and will give away your position.\n\nThe Farmer(s) would be able to have an update every few minutes of the rough area the runner is in. On the odd chance the Farmer will have a quad bike the runner will be aware of this by the noise and the headlights that would beam in the sky.\n\nIf you were to play this by your self you could be a runner with AI farmers, or the other way round.\nI think the multiplayer is pretty self explanatory, Real people will play the Runner and the Farmers. Proximity chat is optional.\n\nIf you are wondering about the type of landscape I am thinking of you can look at ‘Spittal in Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire’ on google earth\n\nThis is my first time so please be harsh, I need constructive criticism\n\nPlease give your view on this idea in the comments👍👍"

Run, jump duck and intuitively user your arms to attack and defend.\n\nIn your dominant hand you've got a gunblade and in your other hand you've got a small shield. Despite the simplicity the combat could have quite a lot of depth. \n\nThe shield could deflect projectiles (back at enemies if you aim well). Powerful projectiles and attacks would require you to use the shield's momentum to fully block and you could also shield strike enemies. Maybe the grip button could be used to throw the shield like a boomerang causing high damage but leaving you vulnerable until it returns.\n\nThe gunblade could be swung like a sword as well as using the trigger to shoot, maybe the grip button could be held down for an alternate fire mode such as charged shot or autofire. The blade could also be used to block/deflect it could potentially hit projectiles back at enemies faster than the shield but would require more precision.\n\nIn Melee the blade would do more damage than the shield and have more range but the shield would stun enemies and leave them more vulnerable to the blade.\n\nTo keep things fresh and fun there would be upgrades and temporary powerups in various places but never in a way which interrupts the flow of combat."
l0iaaw,An RPG where each Party Member's sanity effects battle,"Every party member's abilities cause them pain or side effects, affecting them in different magnitudes  corresponding to the power of the abilities.  \n\n\nSanity affects each member differently according to their personality, a more aggressive character would have higher damage but have defense drops corresponding to their sanity, while a more passive character may lose heart in battle and slow down, or weaken their attacks. Like emotions in OMORI.  \n\n\n(Maybe some abilities can have a configurable power used, where effectivity increases along with Sanity lost.)  \n\n\nAt a certain point, you might lose control of the characters due to their sanity, and may attack party members or harm themselves.\n\nTo counteract this, certain actions can be done in and outside battle to ease each members sanity, such as taking a break, meditating, et cetera. There should be some items or actions that can be used to calm members down in battle, some more effective only for a certain party member due to their personality traits or personal likes/dislikes, so learning each character's personality is useful.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMaybe some abilities can be extremely powerful, but permanently affects the user's stats or minimum sanity threshold. Think like the JOY pills from LISA.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSanity may not need to be completely negative, think of it as stress, an acceptable of amount of stress would focus a person, making them more effective, although too much can break them.  \n\n\nThats all from me, have a nice day yall :)"
l0d8m2,Apocalyptic/Post apocalyptic game set in our timeline.,"So. To make the idea work in a timeline compatible with ours, instead of Covid, we got a different virus, more viral, but instead of causing an infection like Covid, it causes people to lose their minds.\n\nA sort of viral mental break, if that makes sense. Driving it's victims slowly hysteric, paranoid, and eventually, psychotic.\n\nPretty much unstoppable and passed on by careless human transmission.\n\nThis would cause everyone, including the world's leaders to go into a full on nuclear attack on each other.\n\nOnly the most isolated populations would survive.\n\nSome Amish, potentially.\n\nSome communes spread across the world.\n\nThe Faroe Islands, maybe. Iceland, maybe. Greenland, maybe.\n\nSome other small countries, maybe.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe point of the player in this game would be to either partake as a member of any of the factions standing. Taking on a role or multiple roles in helping their community survive, evolve, as well as taking on the struggles and adaptations necessary to survive in a world gone to shit.\n\nI could very well forsee the first 50-100 years happening in almost total darkness, which would mean only the ones well prepared and equipped to take on this kind of event would be the ones to prosper. That might upon further inspection rule out the Amish as their lack of technological awareness would most likely be their downfall."

kzzcvc,A new type of RTS (possibly),I’ve noticed that historically their are conflicts between two states with the goal of gaining a third entity as a client state as opposed to conquering or annihilating the third entity. I think this could be a fun core mechanic for an RTS game where players don’t get eliminated but instead when their army is defeated in battle they become the client state of the conqueror.
kzu02n,Game idea I once had (simplified),"So before I get into the idea I want to make it clear that I have given up on game design a few years ago so if anyone likes and wants to use this idea for any reason feel free to do so.\n\nThe game would be set in a future setting (the world would contain both magic and advanced technology) where a dictator has declared war on the world and has taken over almost everything. you play as a specially made soldier who doesn't remember his childhood and was trained to be the very best. You had been tasked by this dictator to lead an assault on the last 3 areas that haven't been taken over.\n\nThe areas would include:\n\n* a few small villages surrounded by mountains with a huge forest that separates them and is protected by a powerful Guardian of the forest (The Sanctuary)\n* an advanced city of hackers where hacking has become so advanced that they use hacks in the real world (Hackcity)\n* a stronghold where refugees are protected by a once rich yet mysterious man that has tried his best to save as many people as possible.(The resistance)\n\nThe game would have a unique mechanic where you choose which area you go to first, second and third but the order of which would impact the other areas, and the ending.\n\nThis would be a game similar to dark souls where you equip your character with gear and weapons and you will be able to hire people to help you take over these territories while fighting bosses.\n\nAs previously mentioned the most unique mechanic would be that the order tou take would impact the ending of the game kind of imitating undertale in a way)\n\nIf the game was made this would now go into spoiler territory (but since it isn't it doesn't matter).\n\nThis is how each area would go:\n\n**The Sanctuary**\n\n* The main story would be that as you slowly take over the city the forest Guardian sends beings to stop you. At the beginning he would simply make the forest attack you, send small tree creatures, basic stuff. I won't put in too many details so I'll just get onto the bosses.\n* Boss 1: the hunter and his wife from the first town who would use his shotgun and his wife 2 revolvers to shoot you while sending wolves at you.\n* Boss 2: a giant living tree sent by the forest Guardian to defend the third town\n* Boss 3: a damned spirit that was brought from hell by the guardian after the take over of the first town to try and convince you to stop(follows you almost from the start), when seeing that his efforts weren't doing anything after the take over of the third town he would grow to a massive size and begin to fight you (a boss a few minutes after another boss to out simply)\n* Boss 4: a powerful weather serpent made of thunder clouds that prevents you from going to the last town safely forcing you to climb a mountain where 3 statues of the godly serpent reside. There a battle would start where the serpent would take over each statues to protect its weak body from projectiles until finally being defeated.\n* Boss 5(final boss): the guardian, after the take over of the final town all that is left is to kill the forest itself which the Guardian lives in and protects, this would be a 2 stage fight that would have 2 endings if this is the final area you took over, if not the fight would be a 1 stage fight where the guardian dies at the end ( the ending are one where you kill the guardian and another where u end at the first stage by realizing what you are doing is wrong and joining the guardian to end the reign of this tyrannical dictator)\n\n**Hackcity**\n\n* this city would be a heavily advanced tech giant ( a massive developed city) where almost everyone is a professional coder and is run by the master hacker, to get to the master hacker the player would need to make his/her way into the places with the core computers to put themself in the virtual world and destroy the guardian programs that create a field protecting the master hacker's tower. Now onto the bosses.\n* Boss 1: a Virus with a material body that would duplicate and use stuns and slows in the fight\n* Boss 2: the player would enter being surrounded by 4 literal trojan horses that would send slow moving homing projectiles. To defeat the boss you would need to attack the correct trojan horse in order to break it (there would be a small difference that indicates which is the correct one)\n* Boss 3: This boss would start with the game crashing and an error message would pop up, if the player didn't exit the game after a few seconds the player would be able to move again but with an error message still on the screen, if the player keeps moving you would see behind the error message, the boss battle against the glitch  would occur once the player starts shooting at the error message destroying it and revealing a glitched orb. The battle would be simple with the orb spawning enemies and turning into an error message to gain a shield after taking damage\n* Boss 4: This would be a battle against the program itself, rather than fighting a physical boss it would simply be you trying to exit the virtual world while the program changes your controls every minute and occasionally spawns an enemy or 2\n* Boss 5(final boss): the master hacker, the final battle would have the master hacker use various hacks such as aimbot, walking through walls, invincibility, flight, teleportation, etc. The master hacker would actually be aware that he is in a game and at the half way point would freeze your character forcing you to enter the source code and delete the freeze character code to continue the fight. If this is the first area after the final battle you would actually have to try and kill every enemy in the entire city as the master hacker would program this objective before death so you can't escape. If it is the final area he would also abuse the load and save mechanics of the game aswell as change your items to make you weaker.\n\n**The Resistance**\n\n* this area would be less taking place in the stronghold itself and more the player taking out he major people from the resistance. Now for the bosses.\n* Boss 1: the resistance army general, this boss would have you take on the biggest army in the resistance that includes tanks, armoured trains and helicopters, the general would be a buff soldier with an upgraded machine gun acting as a one man army, he would also use grenades and a shotgun.\n* Boss 2: the engineers, the main weapon makers they would hop into a massive mech before the battle that is heavily armoured with a flamethrower, missiles, plasma blasters, and a shock shooter.\n* Boss 3: the mistress, this would be a woman skilled in sword fighting, you would have to fight her and her apprentices as she uses her high tech dual sword and throwing knives to fight you.\n* Boss 4(final boss): the leader, this fight would take place on the elevator taking you down to the stronghold as the leader attempts to stop you from entering, at the start he would disarm you from all your long range weapons in a cut scene so this would be a purely melee 2 stage fight with a physically strong man skilled in melee combat, in the second stage the man would reveal that he is a cyborg and would have all his stats buffed significantly aswell as using laser eyes aswell as a shockwave by punching the elevator floor. If this Is the final area the elevator would having hazards such as saws and electrical fields. Once the boss is defeated he would explode. The ending if this is the final area would also have a cut scene with the elevator stopping and as your character makes his/her way into the stronghold the leader would stand up to crush your neck from behind with his cybernetic hand, killing you and saying ""you can't defeat me"" in a menacing yet tired tone.\n\n*I didn't want this to be too long so I left out many details I thought of, feel free to ask any questions and any feedback is more than welcome as I know that this idea is by no means amazing and I possibly didn't explain it too well. Thank you for reading*"
kzjyhn,I want to make a game with a Cupid/Angel Character. Do you mind if I get some feedback?,"So basically I want to make a game for Valentine's day about love. I'm currently designed around the Cupid character. So far I only have a few gameplay concepts.\n\nA Hack and Slash/Platformer with Cupid. The main goal would be to reassembled the shattered master heart and killing depression. The player would take control of cupid along with cupid's bow, Sword, shield and wings. Cupid would only have one HP before death and enemies would be designed to fall to certain techniques/combos.\n\n I have had many ideas with this concept with one having the player control two characters with the analog sticks and using combinations of team attacks/synergy to fight such as using the 2nd character's launcher move to launch an enemy up in the air for the 1st character to dash to. this could also help in platforming with using team up moves. this also gives story ideas such as Cupid's heart being broken or maybe its a classic spin on Cupid and Psyche. \n\nA Final idea I have is a 3D Bullet hell game sort of like this [example](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1222050/Touhou_Mechanical_Scrollery/). Now this game would take advantage of cupid's wings and arrows. I would also give cupid a mini shield ability for obviously reasons. This would share some mechanics from the hack and slash concept above with the difference being the enemy design, flight being the focus and move set being more aerial moves.\n\nI did set up on my base character controller but I kind of struggled with nailing down what the game's core actions would be there's just too many possibilities but I think playing as cupid and spreading love/hope in a way sounds interesting to me. \n\nI would love to hear any thoughts and opinions on this and especially on these concepts or maybe what you would find fun."
kzhcrj,A tactical pvp war game inspired by medieval warfare maps,"I watch a lot of “historical battles” videos on youtube, like this one[like this one](https://youtu.be/hXI-jhRrwNk) - I like how “clean” the battles are, much easier to focus on the tactical elements than, say, Total War.\n\nWould you play a wargame (pvp or single player) in that style? If not - why not?"
kzgfh9,An RPG where every Item can be used as weapon.,"Pixel graphics, exploring, crafting and grathering items. You start with Basic stuff. Rock and stick. Battle system would be like in pokemon games. You can use items in combat in 2 ways. Throw at enemy, use in melee and - for special items - use/consume. Items would have attributes like: Better use in: melee/ranged attack. Large map. Quests. And RPG stuff. Most items would have ""Physical"" attribute, but rare, endgame items ""Non-physical"" that are useless on most bosses and enemies but strong agnist late-game creatures.\nI could help making game sprites and music."

kzbcv1,I have an idea for a pastel gore simulator,I want my game to be about a cute Docter pastel working at an emergency hospital but sometimes will kill the victims she thinks is unworthy of surviving. There will also be surgery so you can also kill them there. There should be an option to kill or cure/help the victim. If you choose to help the victim your reputation will go up. But if you kill the victim your sanity should go down and your reputation will too. If you lose all of your sanity it's game over!
kz8f9m,Play as a cute mischievous cat,"You play the game as a mischievous cat. You get points for all things you do wrong; pee outside the box, knock stuff over, bite, snarl, ambush, etc. An set  of cute actions are also available. Your owner also has tolerance points. If you do too much bad stuff and not enough cute stuff, you go back to the shelter and ""lose"". So you have to tread a fine line between how much crap you can get away with compared to how much cute stuff you have to do to keep a roof over your head."
kz7o8s,"Casual mobile game: randomly match two or more players and show them a set of choices. If they all make the same choice, they all get a reward, else they get nothing. They cannot communicate.","Basically, a coordination game. Perhaps there's tags like in Omegle. As for what the choices are, I can see this being used for any kind of polling, as a way of gamifying it. One obvious notion for a prototype is to just get random imgur images from the internet, maybe four at a time (can those be filtered to get rid of NSFW ones?), and have the players choose from among those - likely the funniest or most aesthetically pleasing would tend to win. With more than two players, unanimity may not be necessary - rather, the reward may be proportional to the number of other players who made the same choice.\n\nWhat I'm not sure is, what the reward should be or why it would motivate someone to keep playing. It seems too simple. Collectibles of some kind? Resources for use in other minigames? I dunno, give me all your suggestions. If enough people think it's a good concept I may actually try to get a team together to build it."

kyvrzr,"Parents are not home, left alone you hear a knock on the door, the electricity stops, and heavy footsteps can be heard in the hallway it's time to run","3D game, with graphics like outlast 1, horror survival game,and it would be first person, where a madman enters your house and wants to kidnap you because you look like his dead son, the goal would be to restart the electricity and call the police to save you, no  you can't escape by running away from the house because the house is in the woods far from the city and you couldn't stay outside for long because it would be winter, the house would need two floors to have space to run and hide, one of the mechanics should be holding your breath when you hide so that the madman does not hear you, by taking objects you could make simple traps to slow down the madman, it would be interesting to be able to make diversions by making noise to attract  madman in another room, another mechanic would be the timer that shows you when parents come back home if they come back they are killed by the madman."
kytxq6,(AAA) The Flash,"Basically you play the flash with star labs and all of central city in the game aswell, the story would be played out in a structure like spiderman ps4, obviously a different story but in the structure. There would be speedster races like in the show, quicktime events could be use to capture the other or avoid capture during the races. When killed or taken, there could be a cutscene like batman arkham. Like spiderman Ps4 there could be small crimes, like thefts that you could stop. For dlc or something you could go to earth 2, and cities surrounding central city on earth 1. There could be a skill system or some sort of system where the more you run the faster you actually get, i know this might make the game seriously laggy because it would have to load the city really fast but these are all just ideas. There could be appearances of the green arrow and supergirl. Again like spiderman ps4, there could be alternate suits, maybe not suit powers but suits for sure. And thats it im 98.7% sure no one here will want to create this because its such a big game, but i just had the idea so i wanted to get it out -Myriddian"
