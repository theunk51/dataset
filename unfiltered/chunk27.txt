604z54,MTG Moba?,"I know people don't like to hear about MTG being used for another game genre, mostly because of the history, but hear me out.\n\nThe majority of arguments against this that I see are talking about how the customization available in MTG wouldn't exist in a Moba.\n\nThat's where deck-building comes in. Whenever you play a match, you have a hand of 7 cards. You can place any combination of cards you want, assuming your mage has the right colors and you do not exceed 4. Each duplicate of each spell reduces the cooldown, but takes away space from other spells you may want. Like Magic TCG, you can get these with boosters, but unlike TCG, you can get some just by playing.\n\nI have two ideas:\n\n1) You make your own characters. You can make any combination of colors, and you can make any amount that you need. Each character has separate progression (like [SAS 4](https://ninjakiwi.com/Games/Action/SAS-Zombie-Assault-4.html)), and you can earn spells this way, separate for each account.\n\n2) You play as the famous Planeswalkers. They have unique traits, attacks, what not. But the deck-building as stated above still applies.\n\nOne thing I want to point about: Minions, Forts, Keeps, Cores, ARE ABSOLUTELY OPTIONAL. We're dealing with the most powerful mages in the multiverse, here. The possibility of just a map, and having a 5v5 deathmatch is entirely possible. \n\nHave any ideas of your own, or hate mine? Feel free to talk about them in the comments.\n\n"

602q81,"Drop it or keep it, does my game idea suck?","I have been on and off with the idea for a year or two now, my idea is an mmorpg turn based game that is multi-platform. Imagine final fantasy classic with the ability to join fights (think toontown how you joined fights) and play together(each person does a move), it's mostly made but the main hurdle is the battle system and adding content like art and story, does this sound interesting to you or should I just drop the idea completely?\nThe artstyle is going to be 2D and similar to maplestory as well..it'a supposed to be a very social game and you are encouraged to play together. \n~~~~\n\nI also have this mechanic where if players die their character turns into a mob and they have to start over, that mob goes to a map called a graveyard and if the mob is beaten by any player the player that beat that mob gets the strongest equipment the player had and the original player gets their character back, however when you are in the graveyard you cannot tell how strong a mob is or what it looks like unless you are friends or the owner of that mob.\n~~~~\n\nFor the storyline, the basic is that it is a generic fantasy mmo except some NPCs become self aware and realize that this mmo is a game, so you get to choose between convinving NPCs that they are in a game or not. For example, the first NPC you encounter is a tutorial NPC called Bob who actually looks just like a player and throughout his quest line, he is upset because the game devs called tutorial NPCs useless, so they scrapped him and he became a player instead. When you finish the quest line, he becomes a player helper and you get the player helper tag, which allows you to help new players, but to him he thinks it means he's an NPC now.\n\n\n~~~~\n\nPlease give me your feedback. :)"

A game like this but akin to clash of clans; you build your own castle to defend and try to knock down others at the same level as you. There would need to be upgrades and unlockables as you gain more xp and progress through levels.

5yahd2,An Explore 'em Up [AAA],"This is something I've wanted to see for a while.\n\nThe core idea is this: Most modern AAA RPGs treat navigating the world as almost a UI issue, something that should be done with as little thought as possible. It's more or less impossible to get lost in say, Skyrim, Dying Light or Shadow of Mordor... you have the in-game map that shows your position, quest markers for where you need to go, and a compass showing both north and whatever your objective is.\n\nI'd like to see a game where you take all of that away, and make exploring/navigating the world part of the challenge.  This would be a *lot* of work. You'd need to make all of the quest dialog work with the map to make locations findeable, and the map itself would need to be varied and interesting enough to make navigating it possible.\n\nI'd see it as having a Dark Souls-style save/death mechanics (actually, Dark Souls does basically exactly what I describe, but without many quests or much open space, and such intense combat that navigation becomes secondary.) By making players return to discovered points in order to save their progress, it makes being lost actually tense and dangerous. I think a Dying Light style ""dangerous nights"" mechanic could also be cool, as getting lost in a dangerous area at night could be pretty terrifying.\n\nI think it would be fun to learn to survive in a world like that - learning to tell direction by the position of the sun or memorizing a constellation or two at night, finding your way to vantage points in order to organically survey the terrain (rather than have it filled in for you Assasin's Creed Style), maybe even using dropped items as breadcrumbs.\n\nIt would also make the world feel deeper. If the only way to discover a cave or ruin is to actually notice the entrance yourself, then it's always going to seem possible there's more to discover. Hiding just a tiny number of tough-to-locate dungeons/whatevers with their own stories could convince the player's psyche that they're everywhere, and that the world is even richer than it is.\n\nI also think it could be a good way to trick players into engaging with the story/setting. It's so easy to miss much of the plot/setting info in an RPG... this way, you'd have to absorb some of that information because you need it to find your way around. ""Talk to the court magician of King Alfonso"" requires you to actually learn which region Alfonso is King of, find the capital, etc. \n\nActually, now that I think about it, The Long Dark does exactly this, and I'd say it works really well... but due to the scope of the game there just isn't that much to find or do while you're exploring (and no quests/lore.)"
5y7m0c,An RPG where you play as a Native American hunter and the main bad guys are the white people who have just invaded his land • r/CrazyIdeas,
5y73j9,A Crafting centered augmented reality mobile game in the same fashion as Pokemon GO,"This is an idea I had quite a while shortly after Pokemon GO was released in my area. Then I watched this vid from Extra Credits which inspired me with similar ideas: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94KwB205DDk\n\n****\n**SUMMARY**\n****\n\nIn this game, instead of roaming around the world to find pokemon, you roam the world to gather materials for crafting, this can be either mining, harvesting plants, and fighting monsters. You can either sell this materials to the marketplace or to other players, or to craft gears, both cosmetic and functional, consumables, and furnitures for your home.\n\n****\n**BASIC GAMEPLAY**\n****\n\n* Roam around the map and a gathering spot will start to appear around you. Tap on the spot to enter the gathering minigame, the minigame differs depend on what type of activity you are doing. \n\n* For example: In mining, you have to tap at rocks to reveal the mineral inside while avoid tapping the mineral itself, which will affect your score. The better your score; the better your yields.\n\n* Gathering spots come in tiers, as you level up, higher tier gathering spots will start to appear, which yields higher tier materials.\n\n* You have a list of recipes which can be used to craft items, recipes are unlocked by leveling up, but rarer recipes can also be found as quest rewards.\n\n* Earn XP by roaming, gathering, crafting, and questing. Earn enough XP to level up which unlocks more recipe, allow you to gather higher tier materials, and more difficult quests.\n\n****\n**PLAYER HOUSING**\n****\n\n* Every player starts with an item that allows them to claim land on their current location, note that you CAN place them on top of other player's land (Since you are most likely sharing land with people living in the same building as you)\n\n* After claiming your land, you can claim another land after 24 hours, doing so will unclaim your old land but items you placed inside your land remain unaffected. This feature is so that you can still access your land when you are travelling or moving.\n\n* You can build walls and add furniture or trophies into your land, turning it into your personalized house, most of these furniture can be crafted while trophies can be found either from killing powerful monsters or completing certain quests.\n\n* Your land can only be accessed by other players that were in your friend list. On the other hand, you can enter a friend's land if you are in range of them.\n\n* While in a friend's land you can tap on a furniture to get a more in depth description. Otherwise, just watch in envy for their architecture skills or huge collection of trophies.\n\n* Land size is limited. But you can buy larger land with real money.\n\n****\n**BUILDINGS**\n****\n\nLike in Pokemon GO, there are Pokestops like buildings scatter around the world such as:\n\n* **Marketplace** You can sell any unwanted materials or finished goods to an NPC merchant for Gold, or you can buy some common materials from them too.\n\n    * However, the NPC merchants were totally ripoffs, to get better value, you can set up your own shop in the marketplace, and visit other player's shop that was set up in the same marketplace.\n\n    * Setting up shop costs gold, and there is a time limit ranging from an hour to a day, the gold per hour cost is more expensive the longer you set up shop.\n\n    * You don't need to be near the shop to manage it, an automated avatar will be your shopkeeper. Which will wear the same cosmetics as you.\n\n    * However you can't add/remove items and adjust price after you set up shop.\n\n    * When the shop timer expires, all your unsold goods and gold will be returned to you, even if you are not near the marketplace. If your shop sold everything, it will close shop immediately and give you your gold.\n\n    * You can only set up one shop in a marketplace, however you can set up another shop in another marketplace even if you have a shop active. (If you allow it, you can buy more shop permits using real money)\n\n* **Arena** In the arena, master craftsmen hire gladiators to test out their equipment on each other. This is essentially the Pokemon Gym.\n\n    * With a small sum of gold, you can hire a gladiator to challenge other gladiators, equip and customize your gladiators with your gears and watch them battle.\n\n    * When your gladiator wins their challenge, you gain prestige, they will stay in the arena for more challengers, with each win you gain more prestige.\n\n    * After a period of time or after your gladiator was defeated, your get rewards base on your prestige, usually materials or recipes. Higher prestige have a higher chance for better rewards.\n\n    * Each arena has multiple tiers, which are based on their equipment tiers, you can only fight gladiators wearing the same tier equipment as you. Each tier also offer different rewards.\n\n****\n**GEARS**\n****\n\n* Your avatar can customize their range of gears from hats to shoes which you can craft, however all of these gears are cosmetic and offer no stats.\n\n* The only gears that give stats are in your main and off hand slots, usually your weapon for offensive stats and an off-hand equipment for defensive stats.\n\n* Two handed weapons also exists, usually these have both offensive and defensive stats.\n\n* Weapons range from swords to spears to staves to axes to wands to knives etc. Weapon types differ in stats slightly otherwise are just mostly cosmetic.\n\n* Same goes for off all hand equipments such as shields or off hand daggers or magic orb or gauntlets etc.\n\n* **Offensive Stats**\n\n    * **ATK -** Damage you can deal.\n\n    * **ACC -** Chances to HIT.\n\n    * **Elemental ATK -** Elemental property of the weapon\n\n* **Defensive Stats**\n\n    * **HIT -** Your bonus hit points on top of a fixed base amount\n\n    * **EVA -** Chances for the target to MISS\n\n    * **Elemental Resistance -** Resistance to certain element.\n\n* When I am writing this I have several ideas how elemental mechanics work, I typed and deleted them out several times until I realized fuck it just leave it vague.\n\n****\n**QUEST**\n****\n\n* When roaming you have a chance to receive a quest, you can choose to accept or refuse it.\n\n* Once accepted you can cancel it anytime.\n\n* Quests can range from after walking ?km then fighting an aggressive monster to have ?? number of materials in your inventory etc.\n\n* Most of my quest ideas are similar to the video above from Extra Credits, so yeah you get the gist.\n\n* Sometimes there are event quests that are only for a limited time, these usually rewards special trophies and gears.\n\n****\n\nWell that's the gist of my idea, hopefully you get what I tried to say, there's probably more but I decided to stop here. Have a nice day!"

5y5lt3,Fantasy Co-Op Dungeon Crawl [Intermediate],"I really like Co-Op games like Terraria and Minecraft. I really like rogue-like dungeon crawl games like Binding of Isaac. I really like fantasy themes (i.e. clerics, mages, warriors, rogues, etc.) with a focus on the holy trinity of heals/DPS/tank.\n\nSomehow this game doesn't really exist.\n\nI'm thinking of a procedurally-generated dungeon crawl with an overarching story that a Co-Op party takes on playing fantasy-themed classes. Ideally combat would be intense, something like Nuclear Throne. The game would also have RPG elements with stats, gear, talents, and EXP. Additionally, there would be puzzle elements like in Trine, traps, and of course epic boss fights with scary orbs to dodge.\n\nGraphics could be pixelated. Actually, this would be preferred. POV is top-down, again like Nuclear Throne or Binding of Isaac."

5y4i28,What Dying Light 2 should be [AAA],"For the unfamiliar, Dying Light is a dumb but actually really fun zombie apocalypse/parkour thing.\n\nOne of the things I like about it is that the city you play in is littered with all kinds of little modifications made by survivors - boarded over windows, street blockades, various traps to kill zombies, razor wire'd fences, little bridges and shit between buildings to make it easier to stay off street level, etc.\n\nOne of the things I *dislike* about Dying Light is that you never build any of those yourself, outside of in a few very scripted ways. I let that thought soak in my head for a bit, and this is what I came up with: *Dying Light 2 should be a strategy game. Sort of.*\n\nSo, instead of starting off in a city already prep's for zombie survival, you get a set of mechanics to let you build traps, ladders, modify fences, etc. At first, you're doing this just for your own use (build a ladder to get somewhere you need to be, build a trap somewhere you commonly get into trouble, etc)\n\nThe city is divided into ""zones"", and there's a control mechanics (like in every sandbox game ever), but it isn't a straight binary thing - instead of just being safe/dangerous, each zone tracks how many traps, hiding places, parkour features, barricades, whatever you've set up. As you rescue survivors, you can send them on scavenging/other missions (sort of like Assasin's Creed murder missions), where their chances of chances/survival go up the more developed that part of the city is. Eventually you could take it even further, and assign people to a guard tower, set up patrols, etc, and ""civilize"" an area. As a capstone you might even be able to fully secure a section of city, as some zone borders would be ""securable"" with mini-quests (electrify a secion of fence, blow up a bridge, whatever.)\n\nThe whole time you're still mostly being a first-person parkour zombie warrior, but you're also gradually becoming leader of this little society, managing your growing team of survivors, etc. More adrenaline-focused players could still just murder everything, but I think a lot of players would get into the management side, in between the action/horror tasks they undertake personally."
5y3ape,Vietnam era game. [AAA],"I was thinking of game set in the Vietname era or sometime from 1960-1980. The game would be set around trying to capture a flag and get it lowered, but there would be a large amount of people defending (this might be far fetched but I was thinking maybe around 100 - 300 defenders and the same amount of attackers) and also a large amount of players attacking. The defenders would get maybe 2 respawns, attackers get up to 10 respawns. The defenders would have more health, deal more damage, and have the advantage of a defensive position. The attackers would have 10 - 15 respawns but not as much damage or health. The attackers would be trying to overrun fire support bases like these: http://www.hill4-11.org/Louis-Bohn-010.jpg http://www.washington.edu/alumni/columns/march14/images/vietnam.jpg The attackers would try to get to the middle of these places and lower the defenders flag, the defenders would try to kill all of the attackers. There would be a decent amount of customizations for your character, and there would be plenty of choices of weapons. You might get special power ups such as napalm strikes or airstrikes. I believe it would be pretty cool but I don't know if all of the players (up to 600) could be handled well. Any tips to make the game better would be appreciated thanks!"

5y2h1f,Ghost in the Shell type game,"This could already be thing. An rpg game set in a cyberpunk future, very much like a Ghost in the Shell setting. I suppose there could be a main storyline like Fallout or Skyrim. (Plot is an afterthought in my mind lol). There would be a black market with actual rising and falling prices. This could allow you play as a drug dealer/manufacturer, arms dealer, etc. Play a role in policing or avoid the police. Also you can upgrade your personal body with cybernetics, yielding different stats. These upgrades could be sold at hospitals, or much cheaper on the black market, but for a higher risk in getting caught. There could be drivable vehicles like motorcycles and cars. I guess I'd listen to feedback do determine whether or not the map size could be a large city or multiple cities. Another cool feature for money; you could do underground illegal jobs, or if you feel like playing a police officer, you could be bribed to look the other way or help a heist. Also a playable lottery would be cool. So all in all its like a cyberpunk/vaporwave/aesthetic rpg revolving around crime like gta. Thoughts?"
5xyzkf,Simultaneous-Turn Online TCG/CCG With Unique Resource Mechanic,"So I was thinking in the shower the other day about how all TCG's/CCG's give one player the advantage by nature by allowing them to go first and gain the tempo lead, or else go second and gain the resource lead (in games where such a lead is provided), and that this sort of random 50-50 RNG is both unhealthy, unfair, and entirely unavoidable.\n\nThen, I had a stroke of brilliance: what if you had the players' turns happening at the same time?\n\nI came up with a whole intricate resource system and pacing mechanic on the spot. After I got out of the shower, I did some quick research into it - the idea of a TCG/CCG with turns happening simultaneously - and found that there's exactly one card game out there right now that makes use of this idea: Infinity Wars. After another quick bit of research, I found that the implemention of the simultaneous-turns idea was radically, *radically* different from what I had in mind, so this idea is still very much different enough from Infinity Wars to be its own distinct thing. For one, Infinity Wars has a bunch of different levels of innate priority when resolving various actions that determine how cards and effects interact, while my idea pretty much all operates on the same plane of priority, with very few exceptions. (Infinity Wars also has priority switch from player to player each turn, which my thing absolutely does not have: players are given equal priority.) Additionally, Infinity Wars has about a dozen distinct ""phases"" in its turn system that dictate when in the turn you can, say, summon creatures or cast spells or attack. My thing pretty much doesn't have that - it's all one big long turn with no distinct phases, where you can do whatever you like in whatever order you like. Infinity Wars also doesn't have *true* simultaneous turns: in Infinity Wars, one player's actions always happen before the other player's, rather than the actions being played out at the same time, and priority alternates each turn. And, finally, perhaps the biggest and most important difference is Infinity Wars' combat system. IW has two lanes: one for attacking, and one for defending. Creatures in the attack lane may only attack, and creatures in the defense lane may only defend. There are no such restrictions for the idea I'm about to drop.\n\nKnowing that the basic idea was original enough for there not to be a bunch of games already out based on the concept - and knowing that the one that was was radically, *radically* different from what I had envisioned - I set to work on a more in-depth ruleset within the hour, with help, feedback, input, and criticism from some of my other friends who play TCG's/CCG's. This is what I came up with:\n\n#BASIC STATS\n\n* 60 cards in the deck, at a minimum.\n\n* 4 copies of each card per deck.\n\n* Draw 8 cards on turn 1.\n\n* Draw 1 card per turn, at the beginning of each turn.\n\n* Max hand size is 8.\n\n* Max HP values for each player are 25 --&gt; 30 --&gt; 35 --&gt; 40, increasing as they level up.\n\nAll fairly standard numbers for online TCG's/CCG's.\n\n#WIN CONDITIONS\n\n* You lose if your HP hits 0.\n\n* You lose if you run out of cards to draw during the draw phase of your turn.\n\n* You lose if a card's effect/ability text says so.\n\n#HOW SIMULTANEOUS TURNS WORK\n\nBoth players have infinite actions per turn so long as they have the resources and cards for it. There are no limitations on the number or power of creatures summoned or spells cast per turn. \n\nAt the beginning of the turn, both players play out all the actions they want to happen during their turn - summoning creatures, casting spells, drawing cards, etc etc. Their opponent does not see any of this. After they are done queueing up and playing out all of the actions they want to take during their turn, they hit a button that says ""Done"" or ""End Turn"" or something to that extent. Once both players are done queueing up all of their actions, the ""actual"" turn begins, and each players' actions are played out in the order they were queued, at the same time as the opponent's actions. \n\nFor example, on turn 1, Player 1 queues up the following:\n\n1. Summon an Elf on lane 1.\n\n2. Summon a Gnome on lane 5.\n\n3. Cast a spell to buff the Elf.\n\nMeanwhile, Player 2 queues up only two actions:\n\n1. Summon a Skeleton on lane 1.\n\n2. Summon a Skeleton Archer on lane 3.\n\nThus, the actual turn will look like this:\n\n1. Player 1's Elf and Player 2's Skeleton are summoned across from each other in lane 1, *at the same time*.\n\n2. Player 1's Gnome is summoned in lane 5, while Player 2's Skeleton Archer is simultaneously summoned on lane 3.\n\n3. Player 1's spell is cast, buffing the Elf. Since Player 2 did not take a third action, there is no corresponding move from P2 to be played out simultaneously, so Player 1's spell is cast without contest.\n\n#RESOURCES\n\nThere are five resource types in this game: Light, Dark, Fire, Nature, and Water. Light has an advantage over Dark, Fire has an advantage over Nature, Nature has an advantage over Water, and Water has an advantage over Fire. (These advantages don't come into play at all in gameplay unless there's a priority dispute, which will be explained further down below.) All fairly standard stuff: you've seen it a million times. Light, Dark, Fire, Nature, Water - that's basically a blatant rip from MtG, right?\n\nThe twist is that all decks have access to all five resource types at all times, regardless of the resource types actually present in the deck. For example, even if your deck was purely Dark type, with no cards present from other elements, you would still have access to Light, Fire, Nature, and Water resource types.\n\nEach turn, both players gain 1 resource of each element, and 1 ""colorless"" resource. (So, I guess technically there's six resource types.) In addition, if there are 3 or more cards of a given resource type in your hand, ***OR*** 5 or more cards of a given resource type in your hand and field combined, you gain 1 additional resource of that type. (This is to help mono- and bi-element decks stand up to four- and five-element ones.) This ""elemental boost"" happens passively, without player input, and can only trigger X times per level, where X is the level of the hero. (This point is elaborated below.) Elemental boosts are always redeemed in the following order: Light --&gt; Dark --&gt; Fire --&gt; Nature --&gt; Water. So if you only have one elemental boost available to you, and have 3 Dark cards and 3 Nature cards in your hand at the start of your turn, you will gain 1 additional Dark resource and no additional Nature resources.\n\n#TRANSMUTATION\n\nThis is the other major twist to the resource system in this game. Once per turn, at any time, you may ""transmute"" to create 1 resource of any type of your choice, with the exception of colorless resources, by using either 2 resources of any type (they do not have to be the same type), OR using 1 colorless resource. In essence, transmuting consumes either 2 resources of any type OR 1 colorless resource in order to create 1 resource of your choice, except for colorless. For example, I could transmute 2 Water resources into 1 Fire resource, or 1 Nature and 1 Light resource into 1 Dark resource, or 1 colorless resource into 1 Water resource. However, I CANNOT transmute 2 Fire resources into 1 colorless resource.\n\nTransmuting takes up one action during your turn, at whichever point you chose to do it.\n\n#LEVELING UP\n\nBeginning on Turn 3 or later, players are given the option to ""level up"" at any time during their turn. The maximum level is 4. Leveling up costs 2-4 resources of the player's choice (the resources can be of any type, and do not have to be of the same element): the resource cost is equal to the level the player is trying to get to. For example, if I were trying to level up to lv2, I would have to pay 2 resources of any type: if I were trying to level up to lv4, I would pay 4 resources.\n\nRegardless of the point in the turn the player chooses to level up, leveling up ALWAYS takes up *the first action of the actual turn.* Even if the player hits the ""level up"" button as, say, the 6th action of their turn while queueing their actions, the ***first*** action of the *actual* turn will be something along the lines of ""Player 1 chose to level up!"" followed by the resources for leveling up being deducted from their pool. This gives the other player a slight tempo advantage during that turn, as whatever the first action of their turn was will be uncontested, and all further actions of the player who is leveling up will be offset by 1 action later than their opponent's corresponding actions.\n\nHowever, the level-up declaration at the beginning of the turn is just that: a declaration. *The player does not actually level up at the beginning of the turn: they only pay the cost.* It is only a notification and a deduction of resources, along with a sort of tempo handicap for that turn. The *actual* level-up occurs at the *end* of the turn, after all of the actions of both players have been completed, ***if and only if the player took no damage during that turn.*** If a player who is trying to level up takes any damage during the turn on which they are attempting to level up, the level-up is canceled, and the player does NOT get the resources they paid back.\n\nThis means that players have to think long and hard before attempting to level up: you can't just level up all willy-nilly at the first opportunity. You must first put yourself in a position where it is unlikely that you will take damage on the coming turn, then ask yourself: what moves does my opponent have available? How could my opponent deal damage to me this turn? Is he even capable of dealing damage from this position? And, if so, what are the chances it'll happen?\n\nIf you try to level up and fail, you may not try again for 1 turn. (e.g. Player 1 attempts to level up on turn 3 and fails, so he may not try again on turn 4: he must wait for turn 5 before he can try to level up again.)\n\nIf you *successfully* level up, you may not try to level up again for 2 turns. (e.g. Player 2 successfully levels up on turn 3, so she may not level up again until turn 6.)\n\nAfter you successfully level up, your max HP increases by 5 (lv1: 25 HP, lv2: 30 HP, lv3: 35 HP, lv4: 40 HP), and your actual HP is also healed for 5. In addition, you gain 1 additional colorless resource and 1 additional transmutation per turn. Thus, the number of colorless resources gained per turn AND the number of transmutations available per turn are always equal to the level of the player. A level 4 player will gain 4 colorless resources per turn and have 4 transmutations available to them: a level 2 player will have only 2 of each per turn. On top of this, your ""elemental boosts"" for the level are reset, and you gain new potential elemental boosts equal to your hero's new level. (For example, at level 1, an elemental boost can only occur one time at max. If you get an elemental boost at any time, you cannot trigger another boost until you level up to 2. At this point, you gain 2 elemental boosts that can be redeemed passively by fulfilling the requirements, and so on at levels 3 and 4. If you do not redeem all boosts available to a particular level, you do not retain them when leveling up: the number of boosts available is hard reset to the new level number.)\n\nThe strength and cost of your cards do not increase when you level up.\n\n#BOARD LAYOUT\n\nBoth players have five slots on their side of the board to summon creatures on. These five slots face each other. (This is a pretty standard board layout: it's basically Mabinogi Duel, or Yugioh without the spell card zones.)\n\n#CARD TYPES\n\nThere are two types of cards: creatures and spells. They do exactly what you would expect them to do.\n\nSummoning a creature or casting a spell takes up one action. As stated before, there is no limit to the number of actions allowed per turn, so long as you have the resources and cards.\n\nSpells have effects like ""Deal 5 damage to target creature"" or ""Target creature gains 2 Attack"" or ""Draw 1 card"" and such, which take effect immediately - at least on the action the spell was queued for.\n\nCreatures have four stats: Attack, HP, Defense, and Armor. (Defense and Armor are optional stats that most creatures do not have.) Attack denotes the amount of damage the creature deals when it attacks. HP denotes the amount of damage a creature can take before it is destroyed. Defense is like a secondary pool of HP: if a creature has Defense, damage is deducted from its Defense pool rather than its HP pool until it runs out of Defense, at which point damage begins to be deducted from HP as normal. (The reason for having a distinction at all is so that you can have tough, beefy creatures that don't actually have much HP, but rather high Defense stats. For example, ""Armored Knight"", with 10 Defense and 5 HP, has the same effective durability as ""Gnome Warrior"", who has 15 HP and no Defense stat. However, ""Vampire"", which has the effect, ""When Vampire is summoned, drain 10 HP from the creature in front"", would be able to drain 10 HP from Gnome Warrior, but only 4 from Armored Knight.) And, finally, Armor decreases all incoming damage by the specified amount. (For example, if Armored Knight instead had the stats 7 HP, 5 Defense, and 2 Armor, all incoming damage would be reduced by 2. If Armored Knight were to take a blow from a Skeleton with 4 Attack, it would only take 2 damage, reducing its stats to 7 HP, 3 Defense, and 2 Armor. Armor is not deducted by attacks. It is a continuous modifier on incoming damage. If the Armored Knight were to then take a second blow from the Skeleton, it would still only take 2 damage rather than 4, reducing its stats to 7 HP, 1 Defense, and 2 Armor.)\n\nCreatures do not heal between battles or at the ends of turns. All creatures are summoned exhausted unless otherwise dictated by a card's ability. All creatures are unexhausted at the beginning of each turn unless otherwise stated by a card's effect. Many creatures have special abilities that can be activated at any time, with restrictions such as ""Once per turn"", ""Pay X resources of Y type"", ""Exhaust this creature"", etc. Activating a creature's ability takes up one action. Activating a creature's ability does not exhaust the creature unless the ability states that it does (and many do).\n\n#COMBAT\n\nCreatures can only attack the slot in front of them unless a card's ability dictates otherwise. If the slot in front of a creature is empty, it attacks directly instead.\n\nCreatures may only attack if they are unexhausted. (Various abilities or card effects may exhaust the creature before it can attack. For example, a creature with the effect: ""Once per turn: Exhaust: Gain 1 Nature resource"" would not be able to attack the same turn it activated its ability.) Attacking exhausts the creature. In addition to attacking, creatures have the following combat options:\n\n* Attack: Deals damage equal to the creature's Attack value to the HP or Defense pool of the creature in front. If there is no creature in front, the damage is instead dealt to the opponent hero.\n\n* Defend: Exhausts the creature and halves all incoming damage dealt to that creature for that turn. (If a defending creature has armor, the damage is halved *after* deducting armor. e.g. The Armored Knight with 2 Armor from earlier, when defending, would take (4-2)/2 = **1** damage from the Skeleton, not (4/2)-2 = 0 damage.) Creatures set to defend will not deal battle damage.\n\n* Block: If an incoming attack would hit your hero directly, the creature will move to block the attack, moving to the space in front of the attacking creature and taking the damage in your stead. Creatures set to block will not deal battle damage. Creatures queued to block may only move 1 space, to adjacent lanes: e.g. a creature in lane 2 set to block will only move to block incoming attacks from lanes 1 and 3. If there is an incoming attack from lane 5, the blocking creature in lane 2 will not be able to move to defend you. Blocking exhausts the creature, but only in the event that it moves to block an attack. If there are no incoming attacks to block, it will remain unexhausted. (Because combat actions require the creature to be unexhausted, a single creature cannot move to block multiple attacks in succession on a single turn: once it has moved to block once, it cannot move to block again.)\n\n* Evade: If an incoming attack would hit the creature, the creature moves to an adjacent empty space, dodging the attack and allowing it to hit you directly. Evading exhausts the creature, but only in the event that it moves. (Because combat actions require the creature to be unexhausted, a single creature cannot evade multiple attacks in succession on a single turn: if the creature evades one attack, then is attacked again by another creature on the space that it moved to, it cannot evade the second attack.) Creatures set to Evade will not deal battle damage. When queueing a creature to Evade, you can choose which adjacent empty space it will move to if the spaces on both sides are empty. If the space you chose to move it to becomes unexpectedly occupied during the turn, it will move to the empty space on the other side, if that one is still unoccupied. If both spaces become occupied, the creature is unable to evade. Creatures can only evade to adjacent spaces. (e.g. Even if the space on lane 5 is unoccupied, a creature on lane 2 will not be able to evade to lane 5.)\n\nCreatures *only* deal battle damage if they were queued to attack. If you attack an opponent creature that the opponent did not command to attack (e.g. because it was exhausted from using its ability), your creature does not take damage from the attacked creature.\n\nAll combat takes place at the *end* of your turn, regardless of when the attack/block/defend/evade commands were actually issued within the turn. All attacks take place *only after all other actions of your turn are completed.* For example, if you queue a creature to attack on action 1, then queue five further actions before ending your turn, the five non-attack actions will be executed first on actions 1-5 of the *actual* turn, and the attack will occur on action 6 rather than action 1.\n\nIf one player queued less total actions than the other player in addition to queueing attacks, their attacks will happen first. For example, if Player 1, who controls creature A, has 6 actions queued for the turn, with the 6th action being an attack by creature A on Player 2's exhausted creature B, and Player 2 has 12 actions queued for the turn, creature A's attack on creature B will occur *on the 6th action of the turn* rather than on the 13th: the creature does not wait for the opposing player's turn to finish. Thus, attacks happen after all actions of *your* turn are completed, not necessarily all actions of the turn in general.\n\nHowever, if Player 2's creature B was unexhausted, and Player 2 queued an attack with creature B onto creature A as their 12th action, *creature A will take damage equal to creature B's attack value when it attacks creature B on the 6th action.* In addition, creature B's attack will no longer occur on the 12th action: it was ""moved up"", in essence, by being attacked by creature A. Its attack occurred outside of Player 2's usual strike phase, due to the battle occurring earlier than expected thanks to Player 1's preemptive strike.\n\nSo, if two creatures are both queued to attack each other, they will trade blows, each taking damage equal to the other's attack, regardless of whether one attack was queued to take place before the other. If one attack was queued for action 5, and the other for action 8, they will trade blows on action 5, and the attack on action 8 will no longer occur.\n\nFinally, *attacks cannot, under any circumstance, occur prior to action 3 of the turn.* So if a player queues an attack as their first action and then immediately ends their turn, the attack will not occur until action 3 of the ""actual"" turn, and the player will have no moves for actions 1-2. This is to give the player who is under attack two ""safe"" action phases during which they can remove the attacking creature, block the open lane, or otherwise neutralize the threat. This way, players have room to maneuver around threats and safely level up: otherwise, I could simply sacrifice all actions of my turn in order to attack on the first action, thereby preventing my opponent from leveling up and robbing them of the resources they paid, in addition to stopping them from leveling up on the next turn.\n\nAttacks occur in whatever order they were queued in. So if there are 13 total actions queued in my turn, 10 of which are non-attacks, with actions 3, 7, and 12 being attacks, then the 10 non-attack actions occur first on actions 1-10 of the ""actual"" turn in the order they were queued in, after which the attack that was originally queued for action 3 will occur on action 11, followed by the attacks that were queued on actions 7 and 12 occuring on ""actual"" actions 12 and 13, respectively.\n\n#HEROES\n\nThere are an assorted variety of heroes in the game - essentially playable characters - each of whom has their own unique special effect/ability. Many can only be activated once per game. A few can be activated once per turn. Some can be activated multiple times per turn: some are even passives that are always active, without having to be manually activated. For example: ""Once per game: Pay 4 colorless resources: Return target unit to its owner's hand."" or ""Once per turn: Pay 1 resource of any kind: You may transmute one additional time during this turn."" or ""Up to three times per turn: deal 1 damage to target unit and this Hero"" or ""When you draw a Light card: Reveal it: Gain 1 Light resource"" or ""When an opponent creature is summoned: -2 HP to this Hero: -1 Attack to the summoned creature.""\n\n#RESOLVING DISPUTES\n\nYou may be asking yourself: what if two contradictory actions are queued at exactly the same time? e.g. Player 1 casts a spell on action 3 with the effect: ""Destroy target unit with attack 3 or lower"" while Player 2 casts a spell on action 3 with the effect: ""Increase target unit's attack by 4"". Which one resolves first? Who gets the priority? Does the unit survive or die? Or, alternatively: on action 1, Player 1 casts a removal spell on Player 2's unit B, while Player 2 activates unit B's effect on that same action 1. Does unit B get to activate its effect before being destroyed by the spell? Or does the spell destroy unit B before it has a chance to activate its effect?\n\nWell, this is the hierarchy for resolving any such disputes. Yes, it is long, and yes, it is complex, and yes, it is a bit confusing at first glance. But see, the whole point of making this game have simultaneous turns was to remove the inherent advantage given by going first or second: in essence, there should be no ""Player 1"" or ""Player 2"". Both players are equal, and no one player should be favored by the game's RNG over the other. Thus, the goal of this priority hierarchy, and the reason why it is so complex, with so many levels, tiers, and failsafes, is because I want to make sure *it never gets to step 11.* The chances of having to resort to step 11 are astronomically low, and that's how I want it to be.\n\n1. Hero abilities take priority over everything.\n\n2. If both abilities in the dispute are hero abilities, or if neither of them are, the action of the player who is higher level takes priority.\n\n3. If both players are the same level, the action or ability that is higher cost takes priority. (The cost of creatures' abilities are calculated based on the cost of the ability itself, not the cost of the creature: for example, if a creature that costs 3 resources with the ability: ""Once per turn: Exhaust: Gain 2 Light resources"" activates its ability at the same time the opponent uses a removal spell on it that costs 2 resources, the ""cost"" of the creature's ability is calculated as 0, the cost of the ability itself, rather than 3, the cost of the creature that has the ability: thus, the removal spell, which has a cost of 2, is given priority, and the creature is destroyed before it can use its ability. The player who owned the creature does not gain 2 Light resources. Therefore, creature abilities, as a general (but not absolute) rule, will almost always lose to spell abilities if both are activated at the same time, as creature abilities generally do not cost as much as spells to use.) (Additionally, if one of the actions in the dispute is a creature combat action - e.g. Player 1 attacks directly on action 4 with a creature that costs 6 resources and has an ability that costs 3 resources, and on that same action 4, Player 2 casts a removal spell that costs 5 resources on the attacking creature - the ""cost"" of the creature is calculated based on the summoning cost of the creature rather than the cost of its ability, if it has one. Therefore, the attacking creature in the above example's cost is counted as 6 rather than 3, and thus it takes priority over the 5-cost spell. The attack goes through to hit Player 2, then the creature is removed by the spell.)\n\n4. If the costs of the disputed actions are the same, then the one with the elemental advantage takes priority. (Elemental advantage hierarchy is: Light &gt; Dark, and Fire &gt; Nature &gt; Water &gt; Fire. All elements &gt; Neutral.)\n\n5. If the elements are the same or neither has the advantage (e.g. Light vs Nature), then the action or ability of the player who has more resources takes priority.\n\n6. If both players have the same number of resources, then the action or ability of the player who has more actions queued for that turn takes priority.\n\n7. If the players have the same number of actions queued, then the action or ability of the player who has more cards left in their deck takes priority.\n\n8. If the players have the same number of cards in the deck, then the action or ability of the player who has more cards in their hand takes priority.\n\n9. If the players have the same number of cards in their hands, then the action or ability of the player who has more cards in their grave takes priority.\n\n10. If the players have the same number of cards in their graves, then the action or ability of the player who has more creatures on their field takes priority.\n\n11. If both players have the same number of creatures on their field, then Player 1's action or ability takes priority.\n\nAgain, the goal is that there are so many failsafes, things will never get to step 11. There isn't supposed to be a ""Player 1"" and ""Player 2"" in the first place, but it seems there's no other way to resolve this. If anyone can come up with any solutions that aren't pure RNG, please let me know.\n\nSome alternative step 11's that my friends and I came up with (though all of them are just different forms of RNG):\n\n11) One player is red, and the other player is blue. The colors switch every turn (e.g. the player who is red on turn 1 becomes blue on turn 2, and then red again on turn 3). If disputes reach step 11, the red player is handed priority.\n\n11) A coin is flipped in-game, each side with one player's name on it. Whoever's side lands face-up is handed priority.\n\n11) A coin is flipped in-game, and one player picks heads or tails immediately prior to the flip. If they get it right, they are handed priority: if they are wrong, the other player gets it. (The player who gets to pick is determined by whoever clicks the option for ""heads"" or ""tails"" in the popup window first. Keep in mind that people will always be at different places in the turn, since different people will have different speed settings (e.g. some people will have it set to play the turns out slowly, so they can read through all the cards and effects being thrown around and whatnot, while others will have it set to go fast because they know all the cards and abilities already) and due to differing latencies in internet connections along with distance from servers, so. Basically whoever has it set to go faster and thus reaches the point in the turn where the dispute occurs first will get to pick heads or tails before the other person.)\n\nAnd that's about it! I hope you guys enjoyed reading through my idea for a simultaneous-turn digital online TCG/CCG. (You probably did, if you've gotten this far.) Anything on top of this is extra, and not really central to the core idea of the game. However, if I were to make this game myself, these are the cards I'd include...\n\n#CARD IDEAS\n\n(Absolutely none of which were ripped straight out of Mabinogi Duel G1.)\n\n(Costs denoted with ? can be paid for with resources of any type, including colorless.)\n\n(I've run out of characters here, so I'll post the rest of the card ideas - including all the spells! - as a separate post in the comments section below.)\n\n* Creatures that have ""Flying -X"" have the option to attack directly, even if there is a creature in front. If a creature with Flying chooses to attack directly, it leaves its space undefended, so the creature in front of it will also attack directly if the opponent had an attack queued with that creature. The -X, if there is any, denotes how much less damage the creature deals if it chooses to attack directly via Flying (e.g. a unit with Flying -2 deals 2 less damage when attacking directly via Flying than it would normally deal without using Flying).\n\n* Drain: Steals the specified stat, increasing both the effective and max stat of the draining creature while decreasing the corresponding stat of the drained creature by the same amount. HP cannot fall below 1 via draining.\n\n* True damage: Deals damage directly to HP, ignoring Defense and Armor values.\n\n* If a card has ""Exhaust:"" written before the ability, then exhausting the unit is a condition to be able to use the ability. Therefore, if the unit is already exhausted, it will not be able to use its ability, as it is unable to fulfill the requirement of being switched from unexhausted to exhausted status. HOWEVER, if, instead, a unit's effect says ""this creature becomes exhausted"" at the end of or as a part of its ability text, rather than having ""Exhaust:"" written beforehand, then the exhaustion of the creature is not considered an activation requirement of the ability, but simply one of the effects of the ability. Therefore, if a creature's effect text says ""this creature becomes exhausted"" as part of its ability, then *the ability can be activated even if the creature is already exhausted.*\n\n* Note that many Light cards that heal do not specify that they can only target friendly units. Many of them can also target enemy units for healing, which can be useful to destroy or deal damage to some Dark creatures that are vulnerable to targeting from Light effects.\n\n* Note that some cards do not target units, but rather the spaces the units are on. Abilities that target a space do not target the creature on the space, and additionally, they can be used on empty spaces (e.g. if you think your opponent will summon something there at some point during the turn).\n\n* Abilities that say ""adjacent units"" or ""the unit in front"" do not target.\n\n* Abilities that do not specify ""Once per turn"" can be activated as many times as the player likes in a given turn.\n\n* For abilities of the format ""When X happens, Pay Y resources to do Z"", the ability activation is automatic and non-optional unless it specifically states ""you *may* pay Y resources"", and the resources for the cost are automatically deducted if you have them. If you do not, the effect fails to activate.\n\nCard Name|Type|Element|Cost|Attack|HP|Defense|Armor|Effect/Ability\n:--|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:\nElf|Creature|Nature|1 Nature, 1(?)|1|9|0|0|You cannot transmute.

5xxm32,Is this game already in existence?,[deleted]
5xx72a,Need ideas for a game played on a hex grid,"I just coded myself a little hex grid library out of boredom (but mainly procrastination) and I want to put it to use but don't have any ideas. I don't want to do a civ clone or a standard turn based strategy game as there are already great ones available (openciv, wesnoth...) and since what I'm going to do will probably be really small, it won't be able to compete with these so it would be great if it could serve as a proof of concept for some cool and different idea for a game or a mechanic.\n\nI'd like to do something fantasy themed (I'm leaning towards DnD/LotR/Discworld). Otherwise I don't really have any idea for a innovative concept/mechanics/system that would work on a hex grid."
5xwxkk,Turn Based Futbol,"I downloaded [Turn-based racing](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.TBRlabs.TBRacing) and it's fun considering what else could be done with the concept.\n\nI think the next evolution would be Futbol since TBR, as mentioned above, doesn't have responsive AI. I also like the dual window UI of TBR despite that it needs some bugs squashed. TBR also revolves around single laps; is there a way to further refine controls on something like this so that it becomes more fluid?\n\nTBR also feels extremely generic. I can only stand playing it like once  a week. It needs a bit less Gran Tourismo and a bit more Asphalt. I'd like to see this feel like the old Blitz (American) Football series as far as flashiness goes.\n\nI'm not sure if a manager mode would be worth it on a game like this, since it would be set apart from the novel component of the game. And Turn Based Futbol Management seems meh - how would that work in a similar way? I'd prefer to see a Fantasy league playing as a minigame rather than Mgmt. Perhaps some basic RPG elements.\n\nBy the way, how do seemingly all FIFA games have all teams and rosters? That seems a massive undertaking, and probably licenses are expensive? Also, I imagine made up players to not be well received, so this is a big hurdle to overcome. Help?"
5xwp1s,Open World Ecosystem Survival Game,"An open world environment where a balanced ecosystem of AI species are eating each other, eating plants, and evolving. The player's goal is to survive by hunting animals that evolve ways to defend your attacks, and escaping carnivores, who are also changing to adapt to their prey's new features. "
5xvs6h,Open World Police/SWAT Game,"This is a really quick idea that literally just came up in my head. I'll probably flesh it out soon. **Basically, the game is like a mix of Grand Theft Auto's LS/LCPDFR mods and sandbox RPG games, with optional co-op.** You always have an AI partner, but your friend can replace them.\n\nSo in the overworld, a city and nearby rural area, there are a bunch of randomly generated petty crimes (burglary, assault, etc.)  and violations (parking meters, disorderly conduct, etc.), that sometimes have multiple parts to it, like a small story, and you rank up based on how many crimes you successfully completed by following the police rule book. Rarely, more extravagant crimes occur like a bus hostage crisis, a suicide bomber, or whatever. You can call in a certain amount of backup and certain kinds of support based on your rank.\n\nSome buildings and houses are able to be entered and have much more complicated mission progressions. The missions involving interiors are handcrafted for either maximum replay value, or maximum player enjoyment. Sometimes it's just a bank robbery, sometimes a hostage situation, and other times it's whatever you can think of.\n\nThe map is separated by districts with their own crime families. Sometimes families bleed into other districts, and try to take them over. By clearing up crime in each district, the district gets visibly cleaner and nicer, but less crimes occur.\n\nEach crime has a chance that you're able to interrogate people like in LA Noire to progress the mission. How you complete missions (either fail or success) affects your relationships with each individual family, civilians, and the police. Once you complete missions, you get Prestige Points and earn Ranks, which is basically just an EXP system. Upgrades include damage reduction, better accuracy, better handling, and stuff like that.\n\nShooting is slightly realistic like in Red Orchestra 2 (free-aim hip fire and fixed-aim iron sights), movement is responsive like in Max Payne 3 (no jump-diving though), and vehicle handling is very basic but believable like in Grand Theft Auto and the older Need for Speeds (can drift pretty easily)."
5xueqy,game of voting on how many votes each player gets,"Votes are not used up. They can be moved any time.\n\nEach player starts with the same number of votes.\n\nYour number of votes is always rising or falling, depending if more votes are on you to rise vs fall.\n\nEach player's number of votes gradually changes until either someone has most of the votes (since you can vote to raise your own number of votes or your friends) or some balance of power forms (similar to Mutually Assured Destruction).\n\nThis could be displayed as size of circles or height of bars or numbers, around each player. Left and right click could instantly change your vote on any player.\n\nIt needs something for them to fight about, to make the votes matter for more than just having more power to vote about voting."
5xseou,I N D U C T I O N - Based on a dream,"I had a strange dream last night and it inspired me to seek out this sub and post the following:\n\nThe game would be made for PSVR, but here's the catch, it mixes regular 2D gaming with the headset.\n\nYou begin the game in 2D using the regular PS4 controller, you're a lowly programmer working for a mega corporation. You have the strangest feeling that you're being watched and at times guided.\n\nThrough a series of odd events you find yourself in a room with a setup similar to the Animus in Assassin's Creed, there is an unusual headset.\n\nYou walk towards it and you're compelled to put it on, at this point you wear the PSVR.\n\nYou open your eyes in the VR world but everything is black, you can hear a strong breeze all around you.\n\nA voice tells you to open your eyes...you're several hundred feet up in the air, you're falling towards a strange geometric city, you see a transparent ethereal girl who tells you to hold her hand, which you do.\n\nThe two of you fly over the strange city then you land..she walks away and dissolves..you awake..\n\nYou take off the PSVR and continue the game in 2D.\n\nThe game flips between the two modes, each affecting the other in increasingly meta ways.\n\nI even had the idea of using the PS4 camera at one point to stream to the headset so you literally see yourself wearing the headset, if that's possible.\n\nThe game's title would be INDUCTION.\n\nAnd that's that."
5rwzwd,MMO or fighting game idea,"This is my idea for a mechanic in either a mmo or a fighting game. Essentially there is a ranking board. For example lets say you are  rank 109. You can challenge 108 to a battle. (If it is a mmo then you would have to find them.) Now if you beat them, they go down x number of ranks (Don't know how many but more then one so that two player don't constantly fight each other) but if the guy above you wins,  they can challenge the guy 10 ranks above them.  As a intensive to fight the guy that is trying to take your spot. The higher rank you are the more in game rewards you will get. Now after a certain point, player might lose incentive to fight the people ranked below them so maybe in the top 25 you get huge rewards for beating the person one rank below you. Now if it is a fighting game  I was also thinking of giving the top ranked players an automatic invite to the world championship. So, what do you think?"

5ruwrp,Roguelike adventuring game where the world remains the same after death and new games are always started by converting an NPC to the new player character,"edit:\n\nMy gut says this would be best top-down with a randomly generated world with a mix of towns and wilderness areas (such that in any given game you won't encounter all of the types) and randomly generated NPCs/relationships/factions.  Kinda like Dwarf Fortress adventure mode but scaled back in a ton of ways (just the world).\n\nGameplay I'm thinking action oriented like Rogue Legacy, Enter the Gungeon, that sort of thing (though not room-based).\n\n&gt; how would you handle storyline?\n\nFor plot I was thinking standard roguelike, so emergent story built by a combo of starting conditions, what you end up doing, and imagination.\n\nThere could be plot/quest lines that last however long, but really it should be a great feat if your character survives a while (so any one character won't experience many if any entire plotlines).  Perhaps old age death occurs after about an hour or two of play so even incredibly rare and spectacular accomplishments (you're the king of the entire realm!) aren't something you settle into forever.\n\nMaybe you could ""retire"" your current character to let them live on, but permanently remove them from your options in the future?  Maybe you could play as your own child, if you have one (and thus have a longer time to play before old age death!)\n\nedit2:\n\n&gt; You would need a rational for having new NPCs arriving into the game world to replace the characters constantly dying.\n\nMy thoughts are birth-then-coming-of-age (can't usually play as children), migration"

5rrrq7,What's the most ambitious game you've ever thought up that you still thing is obtainable?,"And **No.** Don't just start brewing up something right now that lists off everything on http://yourgameideaistoobig.com/ Actual game ideas you had or still have. \n\n___\n\nMine I just recently came to the realization that it probably won't happen; an open world platformer. But a *huuuuge* open world platformer, I mean I wanted this to be the size of a *continent,* a huge area where all the roads between cities and towns were levels. I remember doing the write up and math on it and just between the overworld there was something like 500+ maps that I planned to all make unique, across what was supposed to be several small states' sizes of areas. But then I thought, ""well we can't just have it all take place in the overworld! there has to be dungeons!"" so I started planning several dungeons, doing basic layouts, then were throwing them like darts on a dartboard to places and said I'd figure them out later or I would copy paste elements of one dungeon from one area and just put it in all the dungeons in that area because they were to have similar *themes* and *history.* \n\nThen I started thinking up quests, the *main* quest, which would give players different options- but no, that's not enough. I need to think about giving the players a ""my game"" feel- so I came up with six *different* main stories, which would cause you to go down branching paths! And characters from one story line where you were allies would become enemies in others! But then also, came the fear of, ""well players are going to see all this and think *I know what this game is doing. They packed so much stuff in one flat plane that it has no length to it, no duration. They made six three hour stories rather than making one twenty hour one.*"" So then I started padding all of them, really stretching it along, I would take players on a grand tour and by god I was going to make them kill every single enemy in the opposing army in a 1v1 duel one-at-a-time if I needed to. \n\nThen stemming from that came the ""combat"" system. I don't remember how this came about but it was some convoluted effect similar to a card game like that old *game boy advanced* Kingdom Hearts game, while also a splash of ""dark souls"" as if I even knew what that meant. It was, per encounter you would start with your deck, and draw four cards. Well each card had three functions, the first a passive, the second an active, where if you pushed the numbers 1-2-3 (the three cards in your hand you could correspond) then it would activate its ability- but if you waited and it got to the 0 slot in your hand, whenever you did your next attack it had *that* as an attacking ability as a modifier on whatever weapon you had equipped. *Theeen* if that wasn't enough, your character would toss the card out- throwing a small particle away from your person which- if caught- returned the card to your deck, whenever you used one you'd draw a card so long as there still are some left. Run out of cards, instant death. \n\nI just have loads and loads and *loads* of notes on this, I put so much preparation into it and actually am really proud of my planning... But this game is never fucking happening. I would need a team of people who all share the same vision as many-many-years-ago-me did and that's not going to happen anytime soon. I'm not saying I've abandoned it, like all good things waiting to make a rebound, but I like to think I'm a lot more rational now and am looking to do other projects before starting that monster. \n\n___\n\nSo what are your ideas that you flew so high they burned up?

5rncd0,Iron Wings - Dogfighting in a Fantasy World,"**World**\n\nIn the world of Iron Wings people born without magical abilities are usually resigned to a quiet life in the country, but our protagonist was born with an intellectual curiosity and a desire to tinker. \n\nWhen he was young he was orphaned by an attack on his village by the evil Dragon King. He was adopted by a sorcerer who fostered his love for engineering into a full profession. Realizing he would need powerful materials and devices to ever get justice for his family he set out into the deepest parts of the world.\n\nIn an abandoned cave he unearthed an ancient relic several times larger than a normal man. It was forged from strong iron and had massive wings. After realizing he had discovered a weapon of war capable of flight he knew it could be enough to take down the Dragon King.\n\n**Gameplay**\n\nThe flight mechanics are the bread and butter of Iron Wings. Every moment is spent in the plane so movement is quick and fluid. The biplane is equipped with a front-facing machine gun, and you can also drop hand bombs from the cockpit. \n\nThe plane is also capable of dodging laterally and upwards very quickly to avoid damage. \n\nThroughout the game you can acquire various upgrades through exploration and combat. Such upgrades include homing ballista bolts, armor plating, tow cables and turbo. \n\n**Enemies**\n\nThe primary enemies of Iron Wings are the bosses. Bosses come in a variety of forms both on land and in air. Some have inherent weaknesses like bombs or being tripped by tow cables. As a boss centric game there will be 10 bosses and several mini-bosses throughout the game world. \n\nYou must defeat 4 specific bosses to obtain the the power to face the Dragon King and end the game."

5ret3v,Game idea,"Well, before I go on I must say that I have no story for you, just a game idea. I'm sure you've all know what League of Legends is right? But I have seen many attempts of develops making it a game directly. My idea is that you first create your own character (with the choice of several classes or maybe within the story it begins to create your character traits?) and level it up through the campaign (which would relate to the lore). After a while they would hit a relatively low level capable and then start actually playing the MOBA part of it. Also allow the person to create a few different characters. And then basically copy LoL from there. Another cool feature could be that they are able to write their own backstory of their character which others can see through profile. This allows for character development and attachment to the overall game. "

5raclj,Ambitious survival game idea inspired by an old RTS game.,"I will start with some information on a hidden gem released in 1998; Populous: The Beginning. Not many people are aware of this game but it's a fantastic piece of work which was just unlucky with the release timing and was overshadowed by other games in that era which took the throne.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nPopulous: The Beginning is a god-style strategy game in which you play the role as a shaman with the goal to obtain as many followers as possible to regenerate your mana faster and learn new spells in order to obliterate all opposing tribes/shaman.\n\n**Check it out: https://gaming.youtube.com/game/UCGmbg8pwa06-i-jgstCvTNQ**\n\n***\n**Concept**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nA survival game set in the middle ages or tribal ages similar to that of Populous. Each new world or map would be randomly generated and should naturally decay over the course of a preset time configured by the server. The end of the map cycle could be in the form of a harsh winter season or something more drastic like natural disasters.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nAt the beginning of a map cycle when players begin connecting to a server they will be randomly chosen to spawn as a Brave or Shaman but there will always be significantly less shaman than braves, for every 2 shaman there will be 10 braves but always at least 2 shaman. This is a tricky thing to do considering some servers might have a poor overall population but the calculation would be based on how many players have logged into a server during a map cycle and not based on live/online players.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAs a player spawning as a brave it would be similar to your typical survival game but without any individual progression such as attributes or an XP system. It will instead be fairly simple survival mechanics similar to Rust. Harvest, Craft, Hunt, Build, Survive.\n\nAs a player spawning as a shaman things will not be like your typical survival game. These characters will be the only females in the game and can wield magic with their main resource being mana. Shaman players will be physically weaker than braves, will not be able to build and their crafting knowledge will be limited. They start with at least one or two spell knowledge but with very poor mana regeneration. Shaman players will be able to destroy braves with their spells if they don't miss, but once their mana is regenerating they'll be very vulnerable to physical attacks from brave players.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBoth sets of players will be able to play however they like but will always lack progression if they avoid cooperating with each other and this is where the game will shine. People are always upset about the Kill On Sight nature of survival games but this game will be the polar opposite while still providing that vital PVP aspect.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIt is the goal of a shaman player to recruit as many brave players as possible and they would do so by using a clan system. For every brave player who joins the same clan as a shaman player, then the shaman player will grow stronger through mana regeneration and in turn will be able to unlock certain progressive tiers in which brave players can continue to play the game.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe map/world would be littered with obelisks, totems and other mythical objects which if stumbled upon by a clan they can choose to worship the object for a set amount of time in order to unlock a new spell for their shaman or another tier for the brave player (Solo shaman players will not be able to worship these objects). It should be a decent amount of time required to worship the objects to allow other clans to intercept and contest the objects. When worshipping these objects it would give off a magical aura into the sky to make others aware.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAs clans unlock more of these powers their shaman will grow stronger and will essentially become a raiding tool. The objects can also unlock tiers for braves which would be in the form of granting your braves the power of a warrior, fire warrior, spy or priest similar to that of Populous. Once the shaman commits a player to a tier they cannot revert back and must be careful not to change all of their braves otherwise the clan will be left without any builders or utility. The tiers will be very simple and again will have no individual progression like attritube points or XP etc.\n\n* Warrior will obviously do more damage than a brave.\n\n* Fire warrior will launch fire projectiles from both hands setting things ablaze or doing decent damage\n\n* Priest can convert NPCS and can maybe cast a kind of corruption on enemy players\n\n* Spy will have some smart mechanics in order to infiltrate enemy clans\n\n***\n\nI hope you enjoyed reading my idea! I just felt like sharing this idea and I'm not expecting anything to come of it, I just thought it was a great concept that I had to get off my chest."

5r5mur,A game about game development that accurately represents it's own development process.,"And if the process changes over time, the game's design should change too. "
5r5lz4,Action Game Idea,"My second idea is a lot smaller. Either for beginner or intermediate developers.\n\nIn this game, you play as a supernatural villain (not sure exactly what kind of creature, outside from being bipedal and androgynous), almost twice the size of an average human. This being has fallen from the sky and has landed on Earth. As you progress through the game, you learn more about the character, as well as events that lead up to the game as well as how it plans to leave Earth.\n\nThe genre of this game is an isometric beat-em-up, in a pseudo 3D appearance (think of Donkey Kong Country &amp; Sonic 3D Blast). The look and feel of this game is envisioned to be very dark and retro, like Doom, but perhaps not as violent.\n\nYour character is on a path of destruction as you tear through mobs of police and militia armed with firepower. Your character uses a combination of power, agility, and magic to eliminate enemies as you progress through maps.\n\nAs you grow stronger, you unlock new attacks, powers, &amp; abilities, to add depth to your move set &amp; create devastating combos.\n\nAt the end of every map, you encounter heroes that serve as powerful bosses. Each boss will feature a backstory as well as an animation that explains how they are called upon to fight your character.\n\nI expect this to be priced in the range of $15 and $20 that would be available for download on PC, PS4, XB1, Switch, etc.\n\nAnd as always, any feedback is greatly appreciated."
5r576t,Horror/Survival game in the setting of a massacre.,"Usually, horror games have those monsters or insane psychos who try to kill you. However, I was thinking of something more realistic. I probably sound crazy, but I had this idea of a game where the player is a Jew in Nazi-Occupied Europe during WW2.\n\nThe premise would be you are a survivor of a massacre (could take place in a village, Jewish Ghetto, etc.) and you must simply escape to some haven. Player must stealth their way through horrifying sounds and sights of the deaths of fellow civilians. There will be squads of Germans who will patrol or search for you and will either shoot you on sight, or capture you for an undetermined fate. I have no other specific ideas, but an improvement to the general mechanics and elements of usual horror or survival games would work. Also a good story that I can't think myself would also be great.\n\nIn the end, the setting could be anything. Could take place in Japanese occupied lands in ww2, Cambodia in the 1970s, Rwanda and Bosnia in the 1990s. Just thought I'd like to add an idea to this sub. If there is a game like that though, I'd be interested to hear."
5r55af,Introducing Myself &amp; My Initial Game Idea.,"I am a graphic designer and a writer. I have appreciated video games for most of my life, &amp; my dream job one day is to write for games and movies. I am learning how to program, but I can't say that I'm in a position to design my own games. However, if there are any developers who are looking to hire somebody to write them a script or design video graphics, (ie: menus, huds, intros) send me a message.\n\nOne idea I want to talk about is very ambitious. The ""flair"" is between experienced and AAA. I know it's almost impossible &amp; would cost possibly millions, but I hope just the concept of this idea can get it off the ground and can persuade the right people that can make it happen.\n\nI am a huge fan of fighting games. I am aware that they are not the most popular of genres today, but I would love for developers, even western developers, to try their luck with at least one game.\n\nThere's a 3D fighting game that I envision. I have tinkered with this idea for many years, in the form of a game proposal document of about 20 pages. I have a catchy, classy name for it as well. This idea is set in an alternate reality of California and features several fictional celebrities, athletes, and business owners as the game's cast of characters. Among those characters are also some unusual professions, such as a tennis player and a cosplayer, that mesh into their styles of fighting. Each character would have a unique set of moves, along with several strengths and weaknesses. The project even has a plot, along with stages and character backstories.\n\nThe gameplay of this fighter would feature just four buttons: Punch, kick, throw, and counter. I feel that this style is so simple and arcade-y, yet so full of depth with versatility &amp; spectacular looking combos.\n\nI would also like this game to be eSports-centric, and feature unique multiplayer modes outside basic PvP. For example, players form into teams and fight each member of the opposing team; the team with the most victories wins.\n\nIt's a pretty big idea, I know. My current plan is to put together a teaser video &amp; put the project up on a crowdfunding site, where the money would go towards the team's compensation. The best case scenario would be to find a publisher to fund the project. I also have ideas for stretch goals and would have plans to distribute the title on PS4, XB1, Switch, and PC/Steam. I am even open to the idea of releasing the game in parts over time, where the complete game would cost $50-60 in total.\n\nIf any developers are intrigued with this project, leave me a message. Otherwise, let me know if there is any criticism or advice you may have, and thank you for your time!"

5r2zz5,Hundreds of players are in charge of various parts of the cell and must cooperate to stave off cancer/viruses (or opponent cell(s)),"This game could be though of as an MMO, but an unusual one because each player is performing a specialized role to serve the cell. Likely this would work well as an io game and be one large (100s of players) faction against another. \n\nAn important feature is that the game would not make compromises to a casual player -- all parts of the cell are named by their correct terms and interact in a fairly realistic portrayal of how cells actually function. But this also isn't an educational game slyly trying to teach players about Biology. Instead, it's a fun game in it's own right and learning some Biology is a positive consequence of playing.\n\n[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQGOcOUBi6s) might give you an idea of what I'm thinking here. In terms of player roles, there would have to be some chain of command, but this should be largely player-based and not a rigid system built into the game. For example, if a few players wanted to branch off and form their own mini-faction, they should be able to do so. I realize this is still pretty vague, but it should be a good starting point for discussion."

5qyar9,Cell-RTS strategy .io game,"One of the interesting ideas I had for an .io game was to have an RTS game in the same vein as Solarmax. Basically, the map consists of cells that can be taken over by units that the player can control and order to move between the cells. As players take over more cells, they gain faster production of units, and a greater unit capacity. However, as a player gains more territory, they will have greater difficulty defending it and ordering their units around to defend against many players at once."

5qvvwp,The Empires of the Old World,"The simple concept is this: You are a commander of an army, in VR.\n\nSet in the Napoleonic Era, this game would be similar mechanically to Total War. The catch is that you are a commander on the battlefield, in first person, overlooking the battlefield and making decisions based off of what you can see and what your staff can report upon. Things like battlefield smoke, weather or landscape features would all contribute to your ability to spot the enemy and act accordingly. Using scout units is crucial, and information stream becomes slower as your army advances away from you. The game quickly becomes a frantic chase for information, all the while your army has to fight out in the open.\nThe graphics can be rather simple, even to the extent of simply making polygonal shapes instead of actual people. Though I used Total War as an example the game would not need anywhere near this level of polish. Primarily, in this game you would have to order battalions at a time, and not individual units. While information coming in would be timed, the orders going out would be instant (since realistically trumpets, drums etc. could probably be used). A minimap would be updated only as information streamed in.\nIn the end, who wouldn't want to be a commander, looking over the entire battlefield and distributing orders. Napoleonic era is obviously just an idea, the game could be set in any time period."

5v0b98,Archery only FPS,"Bit of an odd one, but had the idea for a medieval FPS but almost entirely disregarding melee for archery.\n\nBulk of the fighting is done with bows, crossbows, slings, atlatls (A thing used to fling spears), and slingshots. Melee is still around in a weak tap to swing, not the focus at all. Each weapon also comes with a piece of gear, and you can select a character type to get slightly different attributes.\n\nBows are the good all rounders, good damage, reload, draw speed, so on. So any bows would be geared towards being versatile but they suffer from fairly short range unless you get good at arcing shots. Some could even borrow special abilities from other weapons like ricochet or DoT effects.\n\nCrossbows are the sniper equivalent. Slow reload, but massive damage and instant firing with an accuracy penalty if moving (No aiming down sights, this'd be the only weapon class that would even use it so why bother). Doesn't have much drop off, hence massive range but reloads slowly after a missed shot. Heavier ones would immobilize you when you reload, but lighter ones could be reloaded even while moving or using gear.\n\nSlings are hard to use, but rewarding. Wind up for a longer ranged more powerful shot, but get disrupted if hit during the swing. Let a sling bullet fly on a heavy arc, allowing close or distant shots if accurate and deal good damage. Most would offer a ricochet effect, allowing good slingers to arc or bounce shots around corners, or possibly hit an enemy from behind. Trade of being vulnerable during the wind up and being slowed significantly while doing so.\n\nAtlatls are the heavy weapons. Medium range, average reload, big damage, average wind up. Shots have very little arc allowing for the straightest shots, and can be used for utility by sticking spears in surfaces. Very visible and easy to see however, character making a grunt to give a verbal que a second before they loose the spear.\n\nSlingshots are for the speedsters. Low damage, fast shots, fast reload, short-medium range and a sharp drop off. Shares the sling's ricochet on most variants, are quiet, and can temporarily debuff enemies if shot in the correct areas. Such as a shot to the face to lower accuracy for a second, hitting the elbow to make them restart their draw or wind up, shot to the knee to slow, or shot to the throat for higher damage.\n\n\nHealth would be the same as any game, having tiers of health drops around the map ranging from small, medium, to large.\n\nAmmo is a factor, but can be collected from any dropped weapons just by running over them old tf2 style.\n\n\nGear is something that comes with a weapon, similar to how Splatoon does it. Gear is either reusable or on a recharge, being things like grappling hooks or caltrops respectively.\n\nGrappling hooks would have the obvious use of mobility but could also serve as a secondary weapon that drags enemies closer and damages them. No limits on grappling other than once it hits a surface it must drop on to a roughly horizontal ground to grab on to, allowing you to cling or climb up to it.\n\nWall shields are deployed, up to a few per person but only ever one charged. The shield can be moved if grabbed, being portable defense or to provide cover for as long as their HP holds up and the enemy's projectiles can't penetrate it. So while shields are effective against bullets and bolts, some arrows and most spears will go through them.\n\nCaltrops are barely visible traps that do minor damage, slow significantly in their area and a lesser slow after they've been crossed. However a player may only have one patch out at once, and aren't alerted when they're crossed except for a pain grunt from the victim if they're near by.\n\nBear traps have an obvious effect, more visible than caltrops but way more effective. They slow a target and chain them to only move within a small area until they drag themselves at the edge long enough. Can also be placed on walls for a move obvious trap that deals high damage.\n\nPochette Violin, an instrument which creates a sort of support role for team players. For the user they can play actively to gain a speed boost and slow health regeneration, the same being for nearby allies who also benefit from minor combat buffs like damage, draw speed, etc.\n\nSpyglass to mark a target. To help the team or for a sniper to keep an eye on someone moving in and out of cover. Just watch them for a couple seconds centered in the screen and they are temporarily highlighted. However the spyglass glints light is is fairly visible.\n\nPowder bomb, just a smoke screen. Neither of you can see through it, but good for escapes or blocking off snipers. Also teamwork to hide a trap.\n\nHoly symbols which are used for healing. Hold one up to an ally and heal them. Works on a tether so they have to stay close and in line of sight, but leaves a lingering regeneration. Very slow to take out or put away.\n\nMetal shield, something not suited for lightweight archers and takes both hands to use. However it always blocks damage if you're looking at the projectile.\n\nHawk, a bird of prey to attack enemies and take attention either to line up a shot or make an escape. Deals moderate damage over time but low health and can be outrun by more speedy characters.\n\nBombs, for the alchemists. Recharges fairly fast and you keep a handful at any given time for a reliable secondary weapon option. Short range but has an AoE, visible but high damage. \n\nShrubbery Suit. A stealth option, spend a few seconds using it to hide as a prop or piece of greenery on the map, attacking breaks it and you must wait before you get a new one.\n\nFire pots which can be used to douse the currently loaded shot with fire, enabling it to have damage over time and make a target very visible. However it must be used fast or your own weapon is temporarily disabled.\n\nLastly the character types, used to determine health, ammo, size, and speed.\n\nSquires are the tanks, wearing comparatively heavy armor and bulky. Due to this they are slow but have high health (No actual armor mechanic). Carries the highest amount of ammo and can give out ammo packs.\n\nRogues are small and speedy, but low health and unless using the slingshot or similarly light weapon they have little ammo and must aim their shots. Can draw and use gear faster.\n\nWardens are balanced, no strong stat, no low stat.\n\nSharpshooters are of course snipers. Smallest size, low speed and health, high ammo. Easy to hide but they suffer if they get caught and so should arc their shots to stay hidden. Passively increases the range of all weapons.\n\nTinkerers are oddballs. Medium size, high ammo, slightly lower speed, and slightly lower health. They are able to use ammo types to grant their weapon new attributes like ricochet, DoT, debuffing, marking, or making them leave a trail. "
5uz3st,Turn Based Homeworld,"Hello everyone. What do you think of the idea that is similar to Homeworld, that is a strategy game played in 3d space, but turn based on a grid? The inspiration was a game called Mag Blast (it's a card game). Let me know what you think."
5uycig,Main mechanic for a DMC/Bayonetta style game,"TLDR interesting decision making between sheathing/drawing your weapon.\n\nBasically had this idea when I was thinking of interesting ways to do health regeneration in these action games.\n\nThe main mechanic revolves around sheathing and drawing your sword. While your sword is drawn, attacking enemies will 'bloody' your sword, and this would be represented by an icon of a sword filling up. When you sheathe your sword, the blood gets turned into health.\n\n Because sheathing your sword is not instant (think Monster Hunter) and your moveset whilst sheathed is limited, you would have to find creative ways to mix sheathing into combos, or retreat to safety.\n\nAlternately, you can perform a special 'flick' attack that flicks the blood off as a projectile, stunning enemies, and the attack gets stronger/area of effect gets bigger the bloodier the sword.\n\nThis basically makes a core risk/reward scenario, having to choose between restoring health or doing longer combos. New players would probably sit on a fully charged sword until they get hit, then sheathe and draw and carry on fighting. Meanwhile more experienced players who knew how to avoid taking damage would have a tool to perform longer exciting combos, by chainging together normal attacks and 'flick' stuns.\n\nThere are ways this mechanic could go even further: certain enemies could have 'cursed blood' which would hurt you when you sheathe your sword! You would have to use the 'flick' attack instead, introducing new players to more advanced mechanics.\n\n This would also make fighting groups of enemies with normal and 'cursed' enemies all about hitting the correct enemies, because you wouldn't want to get a large blood meter ready to convert into health only to accidentally whack a 'cursed' enemy and have to throw all that potential hp away.\n\nIt could go even further, with certain enemies being immune to your normal weapon, and would only take damage if your weapon had 'cursed' blood on it.\n\nThats pretty much it. There's some extra fluff about other mechanics to make the game more engaging at a low level but this post ended up enormous anyway so i'll leave it at that."

5ux9yh,Jeb! Bush Based RPG?,
5uveoc,Cryptid Stealth Game Idea.,"Had a funny idea while watching TV one late night.   \n\nThere are many many stories of Cryptids (Big Foot, Moth Man, Chupacabra, and many more) that sometimes physically attack, if not stalk people.  These stories are obviously hard to be proven but that's not the thing. \n\nIn the game you would choose one of a few (in)famous Cryptids and in a large island map stalk and even kill people until you are left alone on the Island (objective subject to change). \n\nThe map would be an Island to essentially ""contain"" the player,  its more gameplay mechanics than ""lore"" or whatever.  Like how every GTA map is an Island.  No one mentions the fact your stuck on an island, you just are and can't leave it, even if you fly. \n\nThe map would mostly be wilderness of a few kinds, but I would imagine mostly forest like the north-west,  with plenty of mountains and a good amount of Swamp (Like mangrove swamps, like Florida and Louisiana) near rivers and the like.  Human civilization would be a few smaller towns scattered on the island with some homes further into the wilderness, even some farmland, ranches, and cabins.   One of the towns would be mostly surrounded by the biggest swamp on the island, with another surrounded by forest, etc.   The Map shouldn't be too big as you don't exactly have access to fast moving vehicles.   \n\nPerhaps a fast travel system for really long distance movement could be used.  \n\nEach cryptid would have its own stats and abilities centering around the lore of the ""real"" cryptids and sightings. But to balance them (as some accounts could be considered ""overpowered"")\n\nSome cryptids would be ""more fictional"" than others,  for example one mode you could play as The Rake, or other creepypasta monsters (But I feel Slenderman would be REALLY overpowered.  But if you stalk the target properly, it would be fun)\n  \nMoth Man could fly, Stun with its Red eyed gaze, and run quickly,  but is not able to take hits well or some sort of draw back. \n\nBigfoot/(any of its many variants in the world, such as Skunkape) could be extremely strong physically, able to hide itself in the forest/trees/foliage, but compared to the others, its slower (not to mention, grounded). \n\n\nThe game centers around Stealth followed by a kill.   But here's the catch.   You can't just outright murder someone as it would be penalized in some manner (less points, less fear, some sort of other thing you want to benefit you). \nYou would have to Stalk your target, freak them out, and as their fear level rises you would eventually attack or kill them at the peak of their fear.  \n\nThe Fear would spread around through other people in proximity to your target\n\nThe idea being you want to essentially cause the maximum amount of fear in your target before you kill them.   The best bet being you would do it when they are alone and separated from other people.\n\nIf anything, the overall goal for the game could be to scare every single human from your island (for whatever reason, maybe such monsters just want to be left alone).  \n\nLike other stealth games, you won't be able to take a hit all that well and humans being what they are... Some have guns.   The only time you want to be seen is when you scaring someone so staying out in the open isn't a good idea.   \n\nAs you go around scaring people eventually the word of your existence will spread (unless you are efficient enough to leave no one who saw you alive, you could slow down the process), people would become more paranoid on the island and there would be groups of ""monster hunters"" like those paranormal groups that hunt bigfoot or whatever who try to go out and find you (dead or alive).  Eventually, when it gets bad enough even police will get involved (initially being really skeptical, until enough of them see you and live to tell the tale).   In the end, people will evacuate from the Island if out of sheer paranoia and fear or the reports of large number of people going missing or dieing. \n\nThere are ALOT of legends of monsters from all over the world (if not the internet!). So the sheer number of different monsters that could be used would be staggering.   So there could potentially be a large number of ways to play the game with each monster being different.  \n\nSome monsters would just be a different skin (like the many different versions of Bigfoot.  Some are more distinct that others) but there are more than enough to make a lot of ways to play. \n\nJust an idea and it kinda spilled forth as I typed.  Apologies for rambling or any repeats. "
5uuvmf,First Responder: A fire safety game,"We are working on our final year game development project. We are developing a fire safety game and we are looking for feedback. The idea of the game is to promote fire safety and nightly fire safety checks before bedtime. \n\n**Game Title:** First Responder\n\n**Target Audience:** 17-18 Years\n\n**Synopsis:** Daniel is at home with his brother Sam. His parents are away on holiday. Daniel does a fire check before he goes to bed to remove fire hazards. While he’s asleep, his brother Sam messes his fire check-up. This results in a house fire. Daniel checks to see if his brother is home. He then locates the fire and accesses if it’s small enough to extinguish. It isn’t, he leaves the house and calls the fire services to deal with it.\n\n**Gameplay:** The player (Daniel) walks around the house before going to bed, looking for potential fire hazards. The hazards can be interacted with in order to ensure that they are not at risk of starting a fire. Sample hazards include plugs, candles, and an ashtray. After going upstairs to bed, a fire breaks out because of Sam, and the player must either put the fire out or escape, depending on the scale of the fire.\n\nClick [here](http://imgur.com/a/hy2xR) to check out the storyboard!\n\nClick [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1FcFgu7UM0) to check out the paper prototype walkthrough!\n\nAny feedback/comments would be greatly appreciated!"

If you feed and care for it as needed it may be a happy healthy critter, if you forget to feed it it may start to canabalistically feed on other starved and perished Tomogatchi bodies lining the streets, if you neglect its play it may strike out and become a serial killer, or perhaps it channels that crave for attention and becomes President Tomogatchi."
5unbol,Three Kingdoms,"'Three Kingdoms' would be the title, and I'd like to set the game during 540-576 AD, in Korea. I was thinking of an open world game where you start off as a peasant from your selected Kingdom (Silla, Baekje or Goguryeo). So to put it simply:\n\n* Start off as a simple, nameless peasant.\n* Option to choose your name (although VAs will still call you 'peasant' or 'master/mistress' etc., depending on your status).\n* Do missions in order to gain money and status.\n* Missions could be: mercenary work, escorting cargo or making alliances with one of the other Kingdoms.\n* Soon become a well-known figure of your Kingdom.\n* Create allies and enemies through your choices.\n* Either help or take over villages in need.\n* Your jobs should become harder in difficulty, and the hardest will be taking out the Rulers of the Kingdoms you are not affiliated with.\n* An optional quest may be to kill the Ruler of your own Kingdom in order to take their place.\n* Companions. however... I'm not too sure if it would be good to have these, but it's an optional feature if you guys think it would work.\n* Maybe NPCs that only appear during your missions in order to help you do your job? Mercenary work missions might be the only ones that shouldn't have NPCs helping you.\n* Blood/Gore is not really necessary for this but if you want it I think it would be a nice, added effect.\n* When text appears, I'd find it quite nice to have anime-style versions of the characters come up as stills. Almost like 'Corpse Party' does?\n\nI'll add more to my idea once I've thought of it - I had a dream of this game last night and I wanted to write it down so I didn't forget."

Goal would be to answer emails and calls as quick as you can to achieve KPI's.  (calls and emails answered using numbers on keypad for correct answers, voice or text for the calls.) Ends after 2 years, and depending on the outcome for the desired ending.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Owners View**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOwner prespective would be an Isometric View where you would have to bid on new accounts, buy hardware, desks, rent an utility's.\nDeal with problems by the owners of the accounts which are received via Email and Phone calls (keypad responses)\nEndings happens after an x amount of years, and once again depends on how you did reflects on how you finish.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThoughts, Suggestions, Violent Reactions?"
5uis9e,Where are the realistic survival games?,[deleted]
5ug6au,Why haven't we seen a sitcom model in a game yet?,"I'm not sure exactly how to word it, but a ""Sitcom"" model being a shorter mode then an episodic but more hard cut then simply atteibuting it to ""Days"" or ""Levels"". It feels like many game types and variants have ignored the gradiant between raw TV and raw gaming, and I think something closer to a middle would be an interesting stance. \n\nOn one perspective, we have classic games like 2D mario, which have ""Levels"", which tend to follow a linear path, but are nothing but raw gameplay. Then in another perspective is ""episodic"" games like Telltale games, which is larger, more robust and independent episodes in a shorter frame of time; each episode is very big but there are only around five. Then, in a similar but different side to that we have the ""dating sim"" model, like many dating sim's with branching path's, or even more appropriately, Five Night's at Freddy's, which moves time linearly but with little variation hold some small player choices. \n\nWhat I'm suggesting is a game that is mild in all of these directions: one that has shorter episodes, in greater volume, with primary gameplay and the ""talking"" sim of a dating sim, some minor variation in branches, and an overreaching plot. Like a sitcom. \n\n___\n\nExample: a game idea I've been brewing up has its roots in listening to various fictional podcasts, mostly being *Welcome to Nightvale.* Basing it off this model, it could be a game where each ""Season"" could be twelve small episodes rather than one large episode, and then releases the seasons similar to how Telltale releases singular episodes for it's games. The episodes would be shorter than the hour-long episodes of Telltale but shorter than something you can just scroll through while on the toilet, maybe close to 25-30 minutes. \n\nExcluding whatever game I was planning to make of this, why haven't we seen this model work here like it does in other media? Has it been tried before? "

5uf0dy,MMO RPG - Make MMOs great again,"Hello!\nI've been playing MMOs since I was 7 years old, and I've been the noob, the pro, the leveler, the raider, the pvper. Here's my 10 cents on a good mmo. (Which we desperately lack IMO.) \n\n/ Graphics\n-Sexy and appetizing graphics. (Apple is great at this, they actually made their laptops look like a piece of candy you'd want to eat. )\n\n-Very colorful (Ofc there should still be darkness in the game, it just shouldn't be implemented bland and boring.)\n\n-Round shapes and forms (Too sharp edges is distracting.)\n\n/ World \n-Big and open world.\n\n-Cool ways to travel quicker. (I.E: Ships/caravans)\n\n-A lot of variation in terrain. (To make you excited every time you reach a new place.)\n\n/ Factions\n- Good vs evil/ Kingdom vs kingdom/ Country vs country\n\n/ Leveling\n\n- You'd have to visit pretty much the whole world while leveling up.\n(This would make you integrate well, and give you a good relationship to the world.)\n\n-You should be able to level through a variation of Missions(questing)/Scenarios/Grouping up(Dungeons/Elite missions)\nand even pvping. It should naturally introduce you to all aspects of the game.\n\n- The game should get harder at a steady and fair pace, giving all new players a way to learn and get better at a fair tempo. \n\n-Leveling should also introduce class specific quests that indirectly helps you play your class. (Ofc I understand that there can't be too much of that since it'd require you to make alot of different quests, that only a part of the games population would allow to experience.\n\n-The game should get more epic as you level, and there should be cool rewards from reaching milestones.\n\n/ Gameplay\n-Auto attack function , target function even.\n\n-Abilities (even healing) should be manually aimed. (Kinda like league of legends skill shots)\n\n-Mobility in and out of combat. (Not too much and not too little.)\n - Some classes should be more mobile than others.\n\n- Fluent and interactive combat system. (It's incredibly important that the combat isn't clunky and feels too slow.)\n\n-Not turn based in any way, combat speed should only be capped by a GCD (Global cooldown.)\n\nClasses\n-Easy to learn hard to master ( This should be the main vision when creating classes.)\n\n-Class personification. (It's very important the players FEEL like the class they're playing.)\n\nEnd-game\n- There should be a continuous  stream of new content at max level.\n\n- The game should keep being interesting and accesible for bad and good players.\n\n-Pvp tiers. (Bronze, Silver, Gold..)\n\n-Pvp game modes.\n\n-Try and limit the feeling of ''there was nothing I could do in this situation.'' as much as possible.\n\n-High outplay potential for every class.\n\n-No pay to win.\n\n-Rewards should come from both grinding and skill.\n\n-Pve should be big group of 25-35 people (the number shouldn't vary.) or small group of 5 people. \n\n-Pve easy content everyone can do, hard content only skillful players will experience. (The game should get harder the further you progress, but there should also be new content everyone gets to experience.)\n\n\nMaking a good MMORPG seems pretty straightforward to me, and it baffles my mind why WoW is going in the direction it's going. (Solely aiming for the casual playerbase, instead of finding the golden middle ground of casual/hardcore)\nAlso it's incredibly frustrating to see how  every ''WoW-killer'' has completely failed at obvious stuff, that would never stand a chance vs WoW.\n(Wildstar too hard/no playerbase for normal players)\n(Tera too grindy/time sink)\n(SWTOR only easy end-game)\n(GW2 BiS craftable gear lmao) (No end-game)\nAnd ofc all the idiotic pay2win games.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

5uehye,Space colonization against technologically inferior species.,"So I am a great strategy games enthusiast and I have this idea floating around my head for a while now.\n\nYou guide the colonization effort of a small group at the expense of a planet inhabited by a species not yet capable of interstellar travel. The mission is to generate profit for the corporation sponsoring the expedition, by any mean necessary.\n\nThe main mechanic of the game is the management of the economics of the mission and political/social situation on the planet:\n\n- To survive the mission must gather funds from selling what it can gather from the planet. Here there can be a lot of variety on what can be found on the planet: natural resources are one possible export. Other revenue streams may be rare types of life forms, if the biosphere of the planet is particularly rich selling samples for scientific research would be possible. The indigenous population itself could be an asset, to be sold as slaves. Even food production can be a possibility if the planet is compatible with human life or with sufficient technology.\n\n- Funds can be then used to bring forward the scientific understanding of the planet, so unlocking new types of exploitation or perfecting the unlocked ones. Operations on the planet have of course a cost, as the maintenance of the orbital platforms, crew and security systems.\n\n- The natives have to be considered as well. Here there is a lot more variety that can be added as well, depending on the technological level reached by their civilization. To avoid reberllion and possible failure of planet level operations the population has to be controlled by infiltrating the government, direct military oppression or mind control technology or genetic manipulation. Of course the effects of the possible operations have to be limited by either monetary cost, diminishing returns or the limited manpower avaible for the expedition.\n\nThe expedition can fail for numerous reasons: uplifting of the population (either by sheer intelligence of the natives, rogue agents or simply by accident) and so escalation of the conflict beyond what can be handled by the player. Unprofitability of the mission, that forces the corporation to shut down operations. Rebellion by the mission crew. Sabotage by other corporations or foreign nations or political groups that condemn planetary exploitation.\n\ntl;dr a mash up between (James Cameron) Avatar, Xcom (strategic layer) and Evil genius."

5udw2m,Open world car mechanic / driving RPG.,"This would be somewhat niche but look at games like Car Mechanic Simulator, combine it with a little My Summer Car, some GTA V (decent selection of cars but would be about 20 base for this game, open world, big online), and lastly BeamNG (damage) and I think that'd be a great game. \n\nYou could even have a centralized ""year"" that servers can set, which releases new car models depending on the year.\n\nThis would include modding, so folk can throw in real world cars since I doubt the dev would get copyrights, etc. My Summer Car and Car Mechanic Simulator's level of detail for taking cars apart and putting them back together would allow you to fix your car, modify with aftermarket/spare parts, replaced damaged ones using a similar damage engine to BeamNG.\n\nI was thinking, you could even take on project cars. I've always wanted a project car game and the only two are My Summer Car (very basic) and Car Mechanic Simulator (hardly projects, they look very undamaged just rusted) and kinda/sorta Burnout: Paradise?\n\nI know this is a lot of ideas but as the flair says, this'd be at minimum Experienced. More or less it doesn't need a lot of features and actually could be streamlined by only having a few cars like Car Mech Simulator and leaving the rest to modders. Heck, this could be a mod to the BeamNG engine even."

5ubdnl,"Different universes, fighting monsters together (inspired by a dream)","So, before I start, I just want to let you know game developing is not my field. I barely play any video games, in fact. This is why I was quite surprised when I had this dream.\n\n\nFirst, I was controlling a guy in some kind of early Middle Age outfit, something made of animal skin. I think he had a wooden sword, too. He was in a forest. It was a third person view. Then, a monster appeared from behind a tree. My guy wasn't strong enough to kill it. After he had ran out of potions and was about to die, I had a window appear on the screen, that said something along the lines of ""Send the monster to someone else? -Yes -No"". I clicked yes, and a list of characters appeared. They were, I shit you not, from a lot of different places and times, and probably dimensions too. I chose to send it to a guy who was a sushi chef in California (don't ask) and the monster appeared on his table while he was working. That was the deal : if he defeated the monster, my character (the guy with the animal skin) wouldn't have to worry about it anymore. \n\nSo we have these characters from different universes, that are able to help eachother without even knowing about eachother's existence. They just know there is a monster, and they have to defeat it. Of course, they are all armed and they know how to fight. I thought this system could be fun too, since you could send monsters from a place (let's say, some distant planet with killer robots on it) to another place where they don't belong at all (19th century England). I just wanted to share this idea, in case someone wanted to make something of it. I know I won't. "
5ub3ee,"""Pharmacist Sim"".. hear me out.","Just found this sub looking for a place to post this idea.

I loved the characters and the humor, even though I didn't get the adult humor then. A simulation type game where you are an old timey pharmacist like Freddy was and you fill prescriptions for the townsfolk like he does a few times in the game would light up my life.\n\nTo be fair, I might be the few and far between that would actually enjoy this, but would I ever! If you don't know what I'm talking about, there are videos on Youtube of gameplay.\n\nP.S. if there is a game like this or you think I would like let me know too. :D"

5u46to,game involving multiple genres for maximum player involvement,"imagine you are playing a grand strategy game, let's say Civ5 for example: when you build a farm on the map, it will give you an average amount of resources right? But my idea is that, you  should be able to move in the farming world, farm better for yourself, manage crops, etc. and get more resources than average. After that you can get back to grand strategy, and moving your armies around.   Than comes the time when you attack somebody with your units, right? At this point you can move to the actual battlefield and be one of the soldiers. At this point you are basically in a FPS game. But you can get back to grand strategy at any time.\n  you can be a farmer, fps fighter, strategist, maybe builder, transporter, hunter and etc. All of that in a single game, with SHARED RESOURCES, that's the most important part. Players will feel that they are part of something bigger, grand strategy. The best part is that, there are already games that can be merged into one, not much work needed.\n I will be happy to help anyone for free if you like this idea."

5u2wxs,A midieval RPG/Survival/Strategy combo. (a combination of ideas from different games),"Hey!\nSo i've been playing a lot of games and still manage to feel like most games are lacking something... so i thought i would write down some things that i find interesting and fun that i would like to see in one game at the same time. (lots of things can be added too)\n\nwhats your thoughts?\n\n\n-Procedurally generated and open medieval world.\n\n--this will make the game replayable and not make people tired of the map. and exploration will still be rewarding, as you find new resources, dungeons, towns, etc.\n\n--many survival games have these features but they failed to attract with their content.\n\n\n-option to create your own town.\n\n--starting from nothing you try to survive and are able to start building small settlements which will later grow to be small town and even cities. \n\n--you attract settlers that pass by your town, ask citizens from other towns to join you, or give the options for prisoners/war slaves to help you build a town as a second chance to life.\n\n--build profession buildings to create jobs and settlers can start working.\n\n--settlers will be able to create their own homes and other necessary building, collect resources, etc. Basically do whatever is necessary to survive and live.\n\n--a similar idea is in a mount and blade warband mod called “nova aetas” where you can build a colony. It doesn’t have that much meaning as it does not affect the game.\n\n--as you are building you can assign people to become scouts and they can scout around the area and report any activities (incoming enemies, neighbouring towns, dungeons, etc)\n\n\n-option to join another town and work your way up.\n\n--“started from the bottom now we’re here”\n\n--you can work for a farmer/smith/whatever to survive, and you start working your way up by gaining more and more money and reputation.\n\n--an example is as in mount and blade warband where you can enlist in a lord’s army.\n\n\n-family and legacy system.\n\n--having a family you can make your name in the world and your kids can carry your legacy.\n\n--you will be able to train your kids in any profession/skill you want.\n\n--the higher your skill is the faster they learn and the better they become.\n\n--you will also be able to play as your kids when you retire or get killed (not dying of old age or maybe you can have it as an option if you want your character to die of old age...)\n\n--an example of this system is the guild 2.\n\n\n-world map\n\n--your map should show the borders of each city and diplomatic state.\n\n--you can assign mayors to each town, and give them orders on how to act.\n\n--create and secure trade routes between your towns/cities.\n\n--world map acts as a fast travel (like the movement in mount and blade).\n\n\n-siege mechanics\n\n--similar to guild wars 2 and elder scrolls online.\n\n\n-army set up\n\n--you should be able to train troops and assign officers that can command their own groups of soldiers. that way you can command the officers to do something and their groups will follow them.\n\n--you should send your officers on missions to prove their worth. You provide the number and type of soldiers needed for that mission for highest success rate.\n"

5tzrft,"Turn-based, Tactical magic and summoning pvp","The idea is to create a series of creatures and spells(much like in Magic the Gathering) and put them into a tactical, tile-based arena like in xcom. There would be no ""deck"". Instead, you would choose 30 creatures and spells and a character to play as. The character decides the spellpool you have access to, as well as maybe a unique ability or two. That character is the one your opponent wants to kill to win and vice versa. \nLet's call those characters Lords for now.\n\nSo, choose your Lord, choose your spells. You cannot choose more than two of the same spell. When you use the spell, whether it's a summon or other type of spell, it's done and cannot be used again. Just like Magic. The spells cost mana and you gain mana like in Hearthstone. You start with 2 mana and each turn you have one extra mana to spend. 1st turn 2, 2nd is 3 and so on. \n\n\nSpells are simply cast. There is no drawing. However, you still have a ""hand"". Some spells and abilities play off that fact, such as being able to view a few spells or alter stats by the amount of spells available and so forth.\n\nI forgot how to format, but I will come back and edit once I refresh my memory.\n\nThe creature stats are as follows:\n\n\n• Health\n• Attack\n• Defense\n• Priority(Turn Order)\n• Speed(Movement)\n\n\nEach creature will have an ability or a set of stats that gives it a niche. None will be obvious trash(like Magic creates every freaking set). Creatures are summoned through spells(Creature spells).\n\n\nCreature Defense subtracts from Attack. So, a creature with an attack of 5 would do 1 damage to a creature with a Defense of 4(assuming the creature does not have a relevant ability or enchanment on it).\n\n\nCreatures may also be able to fly, swim, burrow, phase through walls, etc. I would like for terrain to play an important role. \n\n\nI am not certain how I would like combat to be handled, yet. On the one hand, I could say creatures can choose to attack at any point during their turn. On the other hand, I could have all creatures attack and defend at the same time(again, sort of like Magic). I need more playtesting.\n\n\nNoncreature spells can be categorized by these terms: Enchantment, Incantation, Interuption, Reaction and Field.\n\n\nEnchantments are permanent effects on creatures or areas that can alter aspects and statistics of the game. They are cast on the turn of the Lord.\n\n\nIncantations are cast on the Lord's turn and the effects do not usually last longer than a single round(a whole cycle of turns). \n\n\nAn Interuption spell is cast as a Lord or creature takes and action and is cast and resolved before the action it interrupts.\n\n\nA Reaction spell is cast after a chosen action of Lords or creatures.\n\nA Field Spell is a powerful enchantment that alters the entire field. An example: Flood is a Field Spell that covers the battlefield in water. Some creatures may have abilities that activate during a flood and some spells may be easier to cast or gain additional effects. These effects may also include creating terrain or structures.\n \n\nI still have not figured out how to choose turn order for the Lords and I wonder if I could make some changes to creature stats to make it more interesting.\n\n\nWhat do you think? Would you play something like this?\n\n\n"
5tzrf8,Strategy / MT:G hybrid game I am thinking,"I was thinking of M:TG &amp; Mage Wars board game hybrid game. Here are the concepts\n\n**Core mechanics of the Game**\n\n* The game involves some strategy and CCG elements while removing random elements of CCG.\n* SPELLBOOK:  Players pre-select 40 spells to use before the duel. During the duel, the player can cast any spell in the spell book if requirements are met.\n* The player automatically gains mana which prevent loses due to mana flood/mana drought common in CCG games.\n\n**Mage Class**\n\n* The player will select a Mage Class\n* The Mage Class determines the following stats. HP, Starting Mana, Mana gained per turn, ATK, DEF, HP \n\n* HP. You lose the game if this becomes zero. You win if your opponent has zero HP.\n* Starting Mana .The number of mana you have.\n* Mana Gain. Mana gained per turn\n* ATK. Mages can perform attacks. Fight to the death if you no longer have spells.\n* DEF. Damage prevention when attacked. Has different DEF values for Physical,Fire, Ice, Earth ,Lightning, Dark, and Sacred (FIELDS) elements.\n\n* Mages can have different abilities depending on Mage Class. Some are passive and some are active effects.\n\n**Spells**\n\n* The spells have the following properties. Spell Cost, Spell Time, Spell Type\n* Spell Cost determines the mana cost and mana type required. The spell may require HP too.\n* Spell Time determines when the spell will take effect\n* Spell Type can be Sorcery, Summon, Enchantment, Hex, Construct\n* When the spell has been cast, it goes to the Discard Pile and cannot be used again.\n\n**Sorcery**\n\nTake effect immediately when it resolves. They may deal damage, destroys enchantments and hex, restores hit points, removes status effects etc\n\n\n**Enchantment and Hex**\n\nGrants permanent effect as long as the enchantment/hex is in effect.\n\n\n**Summon Spells**\n\n* Mages can summon monsters using summon cards\n* Monsters have the following stats: HP, DEF, ATK, Starting Mana, Mana Gain, Class, Color\n* HP, DEF, ATK same as players. The monster has unique mana allowing it to use special abilities.\n* Class is the monster class, like Beast, Demon, etc\n* Color is the monsters color\n\n\n**The Board**\n\n* The board has 4 monster for front lane , 4 monsters in mid lane and 4 monsters at the back lane for each mage. The player can summon them in any available position.\n* The mage is always positioned at midline, positioned between 2nd and 3rd monster and cannot change position\n* Melee attacks always target the most forefront lane. The midline monsters and player can be attacked if there are no monsters on front lane.\n* Range attack and spells at an additional range. If the opposing mage has monster at front, the range attack can target monsters/mages at front lane and mid lane but not the back lane. If there are no monsters at front, the range attack can target midline and back target.\n* Every cycle, mages and monsters gain 10 initiative. If initiative reaches 100, the mage/monster gains a turn.\n\n\n**Mage Turn/Phases**\n\n* Begin Phase. Mage gains mana equal to the mana gain and gains 2 action points (AP).\n* Any effects that takes effect on Begin Phase happens here.\n\n* Action Phase. Spend AP on the following actions\n\n* Cast Spell (1-2 AP). Spells to cast have action point, mana and life requirements\n* Attack (1 AP). The mage performs basic attack\n* Special Ability (1-2 AP). Use a class-specific ability. May cost mana.\n* Aqcuired Ability (1-2 AP). Use an acquired ability from contruct or enchantment. May cost mana\n* End Turn. Ends the turn and proceed to end-phase\n\n* End Phase. Ends the turn.\n* Initiative becomes zero. Depending on design, AP can be preserved to use for high level spells.\n\n**Monster Turn**\n\n* Begin Phase. Same as Mage\n\n* Action Phase. Monsters can use action points for the following\n\n* Normal Attack (1 AP). Initiative cost varies.\n* Special Abilities (1-2 AP) Use a special ability. Initiative cost varies. May require mana cost\n* Move (1 AP) The monster can move to frontline, midline or backline\n\n* End Phase. Ends the turn. Action points become zero. Monster retains initiative\n\n**Differences from Magic: The Gathering**\n\n* M:TG uses land to generate mana. The players are required to draw land cards to gain mana to cast spells. This game removes the requirement of Land cards to gain mana to cast spells as it is random. The mana gain is dependent on the Mage Class and removes the random element\n* M:TG cast spells are drawn from library randomly. This game allows the player to cast any spell from the entire library removing the random element.\n\n**Differences from Mage Wars board game**\n\n* Mage Wars is played on 4x3 board. The Mage and monsters can move in any position and may occupy the same area. This game, the Mage position is fixed. Only the monsters move and does not occupy the same area\n* Mage Wars only uses single mana resource. This game has 5 mana resource\n* Mage Wars allows the player to cast any spell(Mana cost is doubled for unsupported spell). This game limits the spell by color.\n* Damage dealing is dependent on dice-rolls. This game removes that.\n* This game attempts to simplify most concepts in Mage Wars that I find too complicated.\n\n**Sample Card**\n\nStun is a keyword that decreases initiative of target by given amount\n\n    +-----------------------------------+\n    | Armored Polar Bear           G: 5\n    |\n    |\n    |  (insert image here)\n    |\n    |\n    | Creature Type: Bear\n    | HP: 5     ATK: 2     DEF: 1\n    |\n    | Active\n    | Attack AP 50 INI\n    |\n    | Maul 1AP 120 INI\n    |    ATK + 2.

5tw7hp,Hotline Miami: The World is Yours,"Why not retell the famous film, filled with cocaine and thugs, in the Hotline Miami way? I feel like it fits rather well.\n\nThink about the story in Scarface. Tony Montana, a fish in a dredging of one of Fidel's prisons, is shipped over to America in the Mariel boatlift. He is giving a conversation by the border team, working out why he's there and then he is sent to Freedom Town. He murders a man for a green card and then spirals down, turning into a drug lord and killing off people like they were pieces of meat.\n\nBoth the movie and the game are graphically violent. Hell, I think anyone who has seen the film will remember the scene that was happening in Apartment 3c; a man brutally dismembered and killed by a chainsaw in the bathroom. The two are rather similar. \n\nAlthough Scarface never had a man in a chicken mask beating the everloving hell out of a mobster with a baseball bat, it does have a man being given a ""free helicopter ride"" with a rope around his neck. So, the two could be paired together.\n\nMy idea is to change the film slightly to fit with Hotline Miami's pace, let me run through it;\n\n\n""Montana comes off of the boat and meets with the two officers. Instead of giving him the rundown, asking him about his tattoo and his family, they cut away from that. They tell him they know he's a murderer, talking about his tattoo, and asking if he likes hurting people. After insulting him for a while, they eventually lead to his family, giving him rhetorical questions about his family that already are in America. \n\nThen, the little bombshell; 'We can assume you want a green card, right?'.\n\nWith this little piece, Montana says yes immediately. No one would want to stay in Freedom Town, no one would want to sit with the dregs of a Cuban society, not being able to sleep as the sedans pass on the highway above you. \n\nThe two officers pause for a moment, then placing a screwdriver on the table. They inform Montana that the next person to enter the room is someone who doesn't need to exist anymore and they place a screwdriver on the table. \n\nMontana accepts, grabbing the screwdriver. They let the other guy in, the door shutting behind him. Then the controls are over to the player and they are, if they want to leave the room, forced to kill the other guy. \n\nKilling him makes Montana drop the screwdriver and more dialogue to start up.\n\nOne of the officers gives him the green card, congratulating him on what he did. The other says a taxi is waiting for him outside. \n\nThe player will be given control again and they leave the room, going down a long corridor, passing other interrogation rooms. There could be scenes of violence in these interrogation rooms, similar to the player's, or simply people talking or brutality against the people that came off of the boats. \n\nMontana leaves the building, going to the road where a taxi is parked, entering the taxi will change the scene to an 'end of prologue' screen. \n\nAfter that, the storyline can continue as the movies does. Yet it would simply have more death and violence.""\n\nMy only other ideas are weapons and masks. \n\nWeapons:\n\n- Chainsaw\n\n- A machine gun with the option to switch to a underbarrel, single-shot grenade launcher\n\n- an Emmy-esque reward, yet it is based upon Altas with the Earth on his back. Similar to the ""World Is Yours"" statue.\n\n- Bag of cocaine \n\nMasks:\n\n- A balaclava made out of the Cuban flag\n\n- a mask made out of a cocaine bag\n\n- 'Big Meech' a leech mask\n\n\nDoes anyone else like this idea? Or is it just me?"
5tt2s8,Managing an autonomous dungeon raid,"I had this idea on my mind for a while. I assume most of you know dungeon raids from mmorpgs (e.g. wow).\n\n\n\nIn the game you get a group of characters with individual stats, classes etc. which are ai-controlled and act more or less autonomous. The player's job is to function as a non-physical raid leader, giving commands to the whole formation. The player might also be able to split up the group into different squads with different jobs. Some ideas of commands, which are assignable to the whole group or just specific squads:\n\n\n\n* prioritization of enemies\n* prioritization of characters to be healed\n* general playstyle: aggressive (high damage output, higher risk of dying group members), defensive (keeping everyone alive, saving resources), neutral\n* setting of rough behavior of individual characters\n\n\n\nI think group dynamics would be neat, too, e.g. causing nearby members of a ""one-hitted"" character to panic, which might be leading to the ""loss of aggro"" (enemies don't attack the tank anymore). Maybe some characters are getting rebellious because they don't get any loot, so they might ignore the player's commands.\n\n\n\nThis is just a rough sketch of the idea, it still needs a little refinement of the exact gameplay."

5tsfsb,A new and rewarding RPG mechanic,"If you know Final Fantasy 8 and the Pokémon GameBoy games, this is a bit of a crossbreed. Sorry for the long text, but english is not my native language and I'm having difficulties bringing the idea across (but it's simple).\n\n## Core Mechanics of a classical JRPG\n1. The characters have a level, which directly determines the player stats. The level increases by earning experience.\n2. The characters earn exp by fighting\n3. The characters can equip weapons and items \n4. The characters can use magic spells\n\n## What this game does\n1. The characters have no level and can't gain exp. They only have base stats.\n2. To improve the character, they can fight a special type of bosses, who become allies after defeat. Let's call them Mons.\n\nThe Mons can't actively battle, but they can be assigned to someone in the party. They have learnable skills and abilities which the assigned character can use. Examples for abilities:\n\n1. Increasing a base stat by 50%\n2. Paying less money in shops\n3. Finding rare items\n4. Character has first strike\n5. Immunity to an element (magic)\n6. Regenerating hp by walking\n7. Quicksave once per hour anywhere\n8. Poison enemies at beginning of fight\n\nThere could be 30 Mons, each one with different abilities and specialties (but way less than in FF8). Each character can be assigned a maximum of 6 Mons. The abilities may be stacked, so that a character can eventually be maxed out by say +30%hp +30%hp and +50%hp from three different Mons.\nThe Mons learn new skills by fighting, walking, completing sidequests, some kind of special item etc.\n\n\nIt's not necessary to catch 'em all, some may be part of the main story while some are optional.\n"

I know they dont have opposable thumbs, so their motor control is far less refined. I dont know if they see color, I dont know if they like music. I dont know what would be appealing to them. It wouldn't be a game in the normal sense of course. It wouldn't have to have a story, or inventory, or leveling up.  But maybe they would enjoy something like [audiosurf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tM8dXHq9uPw&amp;ab_channel=TheBestMuzik). Or combine that with Electric drums they can hit.

5th0g3,[Abstract] Pixel style game about dreams and depression,"Alright, so I'm no story writer, but I've had this one idea going back and forth through my head for a while now, and I've finally decided to make something of it.

In a journey through the deepest parts of his mind he attempts to wake up, but also learns about the true cause of his depression, along with many things about himself.\n\nEver since I had the idea, I had always imagined the game to be sort of Hyper Light Drifter style or something along those lines. I've been teaching myself how to do pixel sprites so I could accomplish that. I imagine that I would be able to make the whole game myself, though it would take me a good amount of time to finish it (not really a problem for me).\n\nAnyway, throw at me whatever you think.

Single server, multiple games, one derived protocol for communication.","This is something I had a little flash of an idea about and I do not think I have ever seen it done (most likely because of the complexity involved).\n\n\nWhat if there was a single server communicating with multiple games, but the games were built off a protocol of communication.\n\nThe protocol would have to be standardized to have games 'work' together. This would give each version of the game the ability to be completely different but while following the IO to the server it would be able to have the meta updates in the game loop change while mechanics of each game are completely different.\n\n\nThis might work the best with a rpg or roguelike. But think of the end works. You could play in the same game, but choose how you you want to play it. Tower defence, turn based, action rpg, strategy rpg, first person could tie in somehow to 2d.\n\n\nA submission of a game would just add a new dimension to the game play.\n\n\nThis sounds obtuse for an idea and I know there is no direct idea or identity for build but that is part of the sell, multiple indy devs could make their own and just adhere to the communication and handle the events from the server.\n\n\nJust a idea."

5ta070,Real-Time Horror Survival - Don't Find The Beast,"I've made a few assorted notes, detailed below. Tell me what you think!\n\n* Player is trapped in a something (I imagined bunker) with a beast.\n* Player has to survive a real-life amount of time before the door is opened and player is free to leave.\n* Avatar has real needs - food, water, bladder, calm, hygiene, energy. Food, Water and Bladder act realistically.\n* Food is scavenged from the area, and doesn't degrade so can be hoarded. Hoarding food attracts the beast, which can eat player's supplies.\n* Water has to be gathered in a container. Multiple containers means more water. Water doesn't attract the beast, but spilling it can alert it, as can dragging large containers.\n* Bladder... as you expect. Leavings can stink if diet isn't properly done.\n* Calm degrades over time, but can be temporarily enhanced by reading or appropriate activity (which may attract the beast). When it runs out, character enters a panic attack. QTE to control self, but automatically ends after a while even with total failures. Failing the event is very likely to attract the beast.\n* Good hygiene isn't always essential, but bad hygiene might attract beasts that can track by scent. Large water containers can be used to wash quieter; smaller ones can shower for a quick rinse, but will attract noise and waste water.\n* Energy determines the ability to do things. Tracked by a timer; when it runs out, the avatar falls unconscious and play is locked for a while. Time is added by eating certain foods (which decreases health, increasing the odor of leavings). Strenuous activities and panic attacks decrease energy quicker than normal.\n\n=====\n\n* The beast is randomly generated, with a few conditions.\n* The beast is always carnivorous, although consumption method may vary.\n* Primary hunting method may vary; possibilities include scent, sight, sound, fear.\n* Volume can vary; beast learns to quieten self as required.\n* Beast has food, bladder and energy needs.\n* Beast can starve to death if enough food is securely hidden for long enough. Another beast returns after 24 hours, leaving that time free to do whatever.\n* Any new beast is stronger than the previous. Beast strength is determined by duration.\n* After half the time passes, beasts gain the ability to fly and hunt from the sky. Betrayed by shadow, or observing from high places. May not occur in enclosed locations.\n\n=====\n\n* Avatar can hide in/under appropriate objects. Beast may be able to find if player frequently hides in the same location.\n* Avatar can safely sleep if beast isn't nearby, but requires a hiding place. Low hygeine can betray location to beasts, as can sleeping near food supply. Sleeping saves and closes the game, but the save includes the date/time of closing. Avatar can starve to death if player doesn't return.\n* Returning to a game after the character died shows a small montage of the beast, if the avatar was hunted. If not, it shows the avatar squirming in hunger in its sleep, and eventually stiffening before flopping in death.\n* Inventory is determined by clothing found; up to ten pockets, 1-5 controls all on left side and 6-10 shows all on right. No GUI shows inventory, player has to remember. Holding shift uses the right hand to search the items. Using the wrong hand takes more time, as does moving. Big items may take one or even two hands to carry, and won't fit in pockets."

Keep in mind I wrote this for myself initially so there's a lot of detail in here most people wouldn't care for, I had just thought someone might be able to take something from this and actually run with it.\n\n     Overview\n\nPOV will be first person for the most part but it has a twist which I'll explain later. Environment will be a medium sized open area, maybe some void like dimension resembling decrepit otherworldly woods, or a similar open area creepy place. Friendly and hostile NPCs will exist in this world, some friendly NPCs offering tasks to complete for rewards and some selling items that could benefit the player. \n\nThere will be crafting, but super watered down to the basics so that it feels more like resource management than gathering materials. I think this idea wouldn't work out nearly as well if the game was randomly generated in any way. It needs to contain stuff like location specific events that trigger under certain conditions with some being one time only events, and the ability to build anything anywhere. So, for instance, on each play-through landmarks and ""quests"" stay persistent, but considering the player has the freedom to build wherever and will experience different events between games the player will find things hard to experience all in one play-through, but it won't be impossible. \n\nThe game will have a day/night cycle and game-play completely differs between day and night. Players will need to keep themselves alive by keeping themselves fed, hydrated, and unscathed by the monsters, helped by adding onto the player made base along with a skill tree type system based on earned currency (EXP) pertaining to the action that caused the gain (for example, harvesting crops would give you EXP for the Farming skill tree, killing a monster gives you Battle EXP, building structures gives you Construction EXP, etc.). The goal in this game idea is exploration and building the perfect ""base"" which you'll need to stay alive.\n\n     ""Base"" Development (Third Person Mode)\n\nDuring the day cycle only, you can switch to a third-person perspective development mode where you collect resources, build (pre-made RTS style) structures, plant crops, and fortify/upgrade your base and have it so that players have to stand in some sort of relative proximity to the location/structure they would like to affect with a base development action. You have the ability to switch back to the default first person perspective when exploring beyond your base or interacting with first person perspective only interactables (Friendly NPCs, activating a structure's function, literature) during the day, more on that below. In this perspective you'd be able to build things like fences, watch towers, resource generating structures, traps, a safe house, and patches to grow crops as well as being able to upgrade structures after placing and being able to move structures after placing. Resource farming (growing crops, exploring) will benefit the player in earning materials for construction, keeping the player full and hydrated, and sold for in game currency. Beyond these features, other objects in game cannot be interacted with \n\n     Night (Monster Siege) \n\nAt night, grotesque horror like monsters come to try and kill the player who is are forced to stay in an FPS perspective until the beginning of the next day when they will again be able to enter development mode. Players will have the option to sleep in order to quickly progress to the next day cycle. Monsters have the ability to destroy defenses and crops even if you choose to sleep in an adequately fortified structure so the only guaranteed way to keep your base safe is to fight through the night or build defensive structures. Monsters are more forgiving when a player does choose to sleep and have a random chance of damaging structures, destroying crops or leaving the base untouched. If the player doesn't choose to sleep, monsters will appear once in a while. Certain structures the player can build can keep enemies occupied, can't be destroyed by enemies, damage/kill enemies, keep enemies out of your base until destroyed, etc.\n\nMonster sieges on the player base will be high intensity situations in that monsters can destroy your defenses and structures, and will do so if they know you are holed up in one. Keep the AI in survey mode like the monster has noticed some new buildings appearing on his turf and showed up to inspect for food - you. Most structures will include a spot or two in which the player can hide if they aren't currently being viewed by the monster. Staying hidden and quiet will keep the monsters in the ""curious"" state in which they will walk at a slow pace in outdoor areas and buildings with already open doors occasionally attacking structures and crops but rarely. Despite being hidden, though, if a monster gets too close to where you are hiding and you don't stay completely still and hold your breath the monster will find you. Say the player tries to hide while in a monster's view, the monster will break open the hiding place and attack the player. If the player is seen by a monster at all, the monster will go into a ""frenzy"" state, making a speedy bee-line to the player and will destroy anything in it's path (if it can) to reach you. If the player can manage to get out of eyesight of the monster and hide, the monster will then enter an ""aggravated"" state (which can also be achieved by making too much sound in close proximity, save for gunshots and other loud noises which will incite the frenzy state even at mid-range) in which the monster will attempt to break open doors to buildings and damage structures and crops more frequently than the curious state in an attempt to find the player.\n\n     Enemies Overview\n\nThis kind of game would greatly benefit from having more than just one kind of enemy in the game, and rather than having tons of squishy enemies have 1 tough to kill, hard hitting enemy appear near your base at night (and only every so often at that) with chances of higher numbers spawning getting significantly lower in chance with each enemy in proximity of player made structures the player is near, yet slightly higher depending on amount of loud noise (gunfire, bombs) generated in that same area. So enemies will be more similar to enemies in games like Amnesia or Outlast in that you don't necessarily want to fight them but rather stay away from them. This gives the game a more horror feel to it rather than another Forest game or something similar. I also want to keep an action element in the game by allowing players to defeat these enemies with traditional FPS means such as guns, melee weapons, and to keep that defense element alive have offensive type structures as well yet keep the level of difficulty in fighting these monsters high enough to encourage flight over fight even in mid-game allowing late-game play to feel more rewarding to the player. \n\n     Economy\n\nThe players can sell items from an obtainable box of sorts, being unable to sell items to NPCs. Selling items won't be the only way to obtain currency in game. Exploration, defeating enemies, and completing quests can earn you in game currency as well. My current idea in mind is maybe idols you can learn to build early on through the construction skill tree that you can ""offer"" items to and on the beginning of the next day cycle, in game currency is received when interacting with it with different currency gains earned depending on the ""mood"" and preferred items of whatever deity your giving offerings to. Also adding in a way to allow players to find out what mood and preferred items are for each, such as praying at the idol to find the mood (for example, when praying at an idol certain phenomena triggers that hints the mood of that deity such as a red hot idol indicating a bad or terrible mood depending on intensity, nothing changing indicating neutrality, and a soft bell sound after praying indicating a good or terrific mood depending on the pitch) and in game lore that hints as to what items each deity prefers. Currency can be spent at various merchants found in certain locations in the open world, with each merchant selling a different random set of items each day and trading for randomly selected item/s that they ""need"" each day. Merchants will discount or possibly give the player a few items they have for sell that day if you give the requested item to them.\n\n     Map Exploration\n\nThroughout the world will be certain landmarks such as abandoned houses, caves, and other horror inspired locations that the player can visit during the day, or night if adequately equipped to do so. Day light doesn't enter these interiors so players will usually run into some monsters resting for the day (random selection and amount of enemies selected in a certain range depending on size of interior once per day) but they are slower and weaker during the day so players can choose to try and take them on or sneak around them and search quietly. These places will most likely hold things like in-game literature on game lore, hinting at certain things like I mentioned in the economy section. Some won't have monsters at all, but rather NPCs that will give you tasks and sell/trade items. These places won't be random whatsoever and designed to be scary in their own way and NPCs would be unique with names and individual personalities so as to make the game more immersive. \n\nDay and night will also feel completely different in terms of atmosphere. During the day, soft music will play quietly in the background all while the players environment is bathed in revealing light. Also, other than some interiors, monsters won't be around whatsoever and the player will be able to explore the environment with ease. At night, though, even inside your house you'll feel uneasy. Low, atmospheric music will play as you can hear the different kinds of monsters occasionally wailing in the distance. You start hearing footsteps and strained breathing near your house, getting closer and closer, and suddenly something starts banging on your door. You know it hasn't heard you because you've been holding your breath this entire time. Eventually it stops banging on the door, but it hasn't moved. Suddenly, it bellows a horrid howl that makes your stomach drop and you can hear it finally making its way elsewhere."
5svu38,Cooperative horror game,"Hi there, first time posting!\nI'm not a huge gamer so I'm not sure if there's something already like this or if it would work well.\n\nWhat I thought of was a cooperative horror game for two, maybe three, players who start off together but get split up towards the start of the game, whether voluntarily or forcibly. They then have to survive the environment, solve puzzles and find their way back to each other. Perhaps they are in an intelligently shifting maze-like building (something like Layers of Fear) so they know that the other person is close, could maybe even hear their screams though the walls, but can't reach them.\n\nFor a while the players are able to communicate through voice chat or walkie talkies, but this suddenly cuts out, leaving them all alone. They may find a way to communicate sporadically (through notes or some such) and could be required to help each other solve puzzles. Idk I just really like the idea of having the comfort of playing with your friend being suddenly snatched away."

5sqe8x,Xcom/Fallout,"Basically XCom, but it uses the SPECIAL system that fallout uses. And it has the whole fallout storyline. The player is the overseer of vault 000; his vault is the only one not destroyed or taken over. You then systematically take over all the other vaults in the nation using your troops (with SPECIAL stats, of course) and whenever you command them in combat, it uses the VATS overlay\n\nand yes, I know fallout was a turn based strategy game at first."
5sq3sd,multiplayer RTS game,"So, I had this idea which is pretty much a multiplayer RTS game where there are 2+ teams of more than 3 players, against each other. The teams consist of an overall leader who is pretty much a general of the team and then the other members will be essentially majors, the general would have an overview of the galaxy 10+ planets (trying to keep multiplayer gameplay short as possible) and he would have to take control of the planets by assigning the majors to the planet to take control of it, the other team will be trying to take control of the planet too. The majors will go to the planets and build up their own units, defences and buildings such as factories and mines to create resources to provide for the team, the majors will have to request aid and extra resources from the general who will distribute where fit, the general will have to monitor all his majors and control his spacecraft which he will use to pick up recourses troops from planets his members are in, so he may have a member who has lots of iron at the planet they are in and another may be lacking in iron he will have to pick it up and distribute it this takes some time to travel from planet to planet and this is where his tactics will come in as one of his majors may request a retreat from the planet as the other team is taking control of it and they are losing to many troops and he will have to leave his member without iron to go and save as many troops and the major before the other team takes over the planet kidnaps or kills the major. the major must defend until the spacecraft arrives, when a major builds up his defences and the planet has essentially become self-sufficient with the troops/workers there then he may leave and either go and help another planet or take his troops and invade the other teams planet bases, moving from planet to planet is done again by the teams spacecraft.\nI can see this becoming very hectic fast so like a general be controlling his spacecraft at the other end of the galaxy map and one of his bases gets attacked then the major must defend his base for a decent amount or retreat and try and save as many recourses as possible.\n\nthe game don't have to be space, it could be earth with a like a boat to move around\n\nWhat do you think?\n"

You have turned thirty, but your best friend is less than a year younger. Since you're running out of options, you dedicate the next few months to sabotaging their potential relationships.\n\nI could see this either being a visual novel, OR a game playing more like Yandere Simulator (minus panty shots, murder, and the other more psychotic options). I also came up with a cute name for it. ""Forever Alone With You"""

5sjo3k,Humans vs Ghosts,"**Edit: Didn't know that I needed to be so specific, my bad**\n\nBasically this game is Ghostbusters meets Grand Theft Auto. There are two teams your character can be on:\n\n#Teams\n##Human\nIf you are a Human, your first goal is to work with other humans to become filthy rich. How you do this doesn't matter as the game is open world. You can even catch ghosts for a living, which can certainly help the other players. Your second goal is to protect you and the other players from possession. Seeing how the game is open world, there are several ways to do this, such as inventing machines that block out ghosts when triggered.\n###NPC Human\nNPC Human is a special team accessible only by an NPC being possessed by a ghost.\n####Stationary NPCs\nThe ghost knows what the character is programmed to say, and can modify the dialog. They can also modify their name, and they can change the position the NPC is standing in as long as it's not too far.\n####Street NPCs\nPlaceholder NPCs that serve to make the game feel less like a ghost town. *(Pun intended)* Ghosts can possess these freely.\n##Ghost\nSpeaking of ghosts, if you are a Ghost your goal is to haunt humans, from just being annoying, to downright murderous, to actually helpful. Again, how you do this doesn't matter. You can possess NPCs and other Human players. If a Human becomes possessed, they switch to Ghost mode until they find another body, or the Ghost leaves their body. If the body is abandoned by the Ghost, it dies until either the former owner of the body reclaims it, or it gets possessed again.\n\nIf a Human is killed, a Ghost can take over the dead body, unless you are said Human being killed. The only exception is if your body was possessed when you died.\n#Game Mechanics\n\n##Leveling Up\n###As Human\nEXP is measured by how much money total you've earned. $50 is one experience point. To move from levels 1-5 you only need 25 EXP. However, after that every time you level up the amount multiplies by 1.10.\n###As Ghost\nGhosts earn EXP by possessing. How much they level up depends on how much money the human has when being possessed. However, ghosts are harder to level up, because one experience point is actually $100. NPCs are worth nothing, however they can be used as a gateway into possessing humans.\n##Health\n###As Human\nYou start with 20 health points at level 1 (broke college student), but as you progress further in the game and acquire more money, your player level goes up making it harder to become possessed, especially by lower level ghosts.\n###As Ghost\nYou can't be harmed as you are just a soul. However, your level does still matter as you need to be at higher levels to possess higher level players.\n##Population Control\n* When 50% of the playerbase on a public server is ghosts, everybody except a randomly selected 10% of the existing ghosts turns back into a human, having their body automatically regenerated.\n * The host of a private server can do this whenever they want.\n* Depending on the money they have, humans who want to be a ghost can choose to kill their bodies for another ghost to reclaim, meanwhile the original owner is somewhere else doing stuff.\n* Depending on the money the ghost had when departing their human bodies, ghosts who want to be a human can create a new body for themselves and play as a human.\n * Also, if this option is not available for the ghost, there's always Street NPCs.\n* Each public server can hold 10-200 people.\n* Private servers can hold 3-25 people."
5si5p6,2D action game with one long boss battle,"Basically the way this game works is your character is told by a God that an extremely powerful villain is attacking and you have to stop him. \n\nThere's a short segment of fighting weak enemies to try and level up before the God says there's not enough time and just gives you all of his power.\n\nThe rest of the game is one long boss battle with multiple phases (with a moment to save between each phase) Some phases may have different styles of play. For example, a phase where both characters are flying might play like a bullet hell game.\n\nThe idea is to have the feeling of two super powerful people fighting eachother and constantly matching eachother step for step as they keep ramping things up.\n\n\nI'd be happy to hear any thoughts or ways to improve on this idea."
5sgeox,"Minecraft-like sanbox game, where the world wraps around","I actually know what would be needed to do that, but I`m not smart enough to do the game.\n\nIf you limit an integer to a specific length (e.g. 8 bits, which would be insane), you could instead of preventing overflow just allow it and the world would wrap around.\n\nI know there are some problems, but it should actually work for blocks after some fixes. ~~I just don`t know an easy solution for entities, because floats have got no overflow, at least not one like the integers.~~ But maybe someone finds that useful.\n\nEDIT1: For the entities one could just use fixed point numbers.\n\nEDIT2: I just mean horizontal wrap and no vertical one, beucause with that method this would result in the world floating above itself."

Also I'm thinking they should figure out how to do a subway surfer clone without the lanes, make some actual branching paths so we can have room for ramps and wall jumping and whatnot. "

5sd5yp,"""Creepy Bambi"" or ""A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing""","This is an idea I always thought would be awesome but super challenging because of a few self imposed rules I have about it. I would appreciate any ideas people have that fall under the ""rules"" for this game.\n\nThe game takes place in a cute forest with adorable animals (deer, bunnies etc).  Something happens to the animals which makes them stalk and attack you.  The idea is to make this game as intense and as freaky as you possibly can for the player, BUT keep the game still look happy with cute animals.\n\nA list of things to keep in mind to make it freaky.\n\n-Creepy animal animations, unnatural movement, twisting heads, deer crawling in treetops.\n\n-I think it is important that the player be very focused and wrapped up in the game.  This especially seems to happen when players are challenged.   \n\n-The animals could even be played by other players. \n\n-Creepy music, and also, happy music can be even creepier if used correctly.\n\n-[The Mannequin Easter Egg in Black Ops](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpuRkw0YWJo&amp;ab_channel=ghostxteengamer) comes to mind.  The world is bright, and the mannequins dont look scary under normal conditions.

5sbznb,Like Skyrim but better!,"So, first off, the title is a joke. Skyrim took hundreds of people and one hundred million-ish of dollars to make. I just wanted to trigger some people who know the amount of effort it really takes to make a game. :)\n\n**The Game:**\n\n\n\n**Backstory**\nA bland story.  You are a random adventurer in medieval times. There is turmoil in the land, because of bad kings and lords. Your goal is to unite the kingdom.  \n\n**Gameplay**\nThis is a First Person, Single Player game that is offline. The graphics would be similar to [this collection I made](http://imgur.com/a/WdoZ6) - Except the character models would be a higher poly count, something **closer** to [this](https://sketchfab.com/models/50068d0ab2734132804cffd4e2688d0c).\n\n**Part One: Quests**\nYou know you want to rule the kingdom eventually. The world is open world like Skyrim, and various areas are controlled by different leaders. As you make money and gain reputation, your first major goal is to either build a small keep, or take one over, so you start on quests and stuff. The quests are a much smaller part of the game than in Skyrim, there is not as many. Less side stories, less voice-acting and less interact-able objects like recipes, plants, crafting and weapons. Still some, but it's less of a focus, as you will see. \n\nYou can take a couple of routes to accomplish the same goal depending on play style. You can make money by hunting treasure, do quests for people to gain followers or to trade people for their skills.\n\n**Part 2 Castle Construction and Management**\nYou can either attack an existing keep or build your own.  When you build your own, you **design** it in first person view a bit like [Sanctum 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utQ3l3_J6WE&amp;ab_channel=deluxe345)'s construction. You will have to defend your keep throughout the game, so the Construction System is very much based around defense in a first person combat situation, which will be explained in Part 3. Also [Medieval Engineers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Q5GlYA8oU&amp;ab_channel=Draegast), but not as much variety, and much less destruction. \n\nYou don't just carry a bunch of stone and instantly build a castle.  You have to either hire people, or do quests to put them in your debt in the beginning.  You attract various types workers to your castle, they will build farms, archerys, etc. You can chose where these are positioned, but you don't get to design these buildings in detail.  This portion of the game is basically like a castle management sim.  You want to attract people to your castle, amass an army, balance the type of buildings you have, and defend against enemies.  \n\nYou also eventually attack other castles until you have it all. Diplomacy would probably play some role, alliances.\n\n**Part 3 Battles**\n\nThe side quests I described would mostly involve just a few people, similar to Skyrim in that respect. But when you prepare to attack or defend a castle, there would be planning and preparation, more buildup, and the fight would be more epic, something like [For Honor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnNT11XfRnE&amp;ab_channel=NeebsGaming) or [Chivalry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAarhmfnp40&amp;ab_channel=someshot) - But remember, it is single player, and less intensive graphics.\n\nThats the gist of it.\n\n\nSee also:\n[Mount And Blade 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pv2qb66PbUg&amp;ab_channel=TaleWorldsEntertainment)\n\n[Hyrule Warriors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB8rVWtbJTo&amp;ab_channel=ZackScottGames)\n"
5sao83,(Educational) Just an idea for a game that teaches Logical Fallacies.,"This game is not a wild and crazy dream idea. It game be made in a simple program like GameMaker, and could be a very simple game to make (in comparison to other games) This is an idea for a game which I think is super cool, but it's something Ill likely never do, so I wanted to share the idea because I love it..\n\nThe idea is basically you are a detective, like Sherlock Holmes. I imagine it like a 2D who-dunn-it mystery game.\n\nYou have to solve crimes by interviewing witnesses and lying. The catch is that anytime someone uses a [fallacy](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/system/App/Settings/size24x36posters/000/000/001/original/FallaciesPoster24x36.pdf), they are lying.  I was thinking if you call someone out as lying and correctly name the fallacy you get an advantage like they break down and tell you more info or something. This way if a person just guesses without thinking until they get it right, they are at a big disadvantage.  If the player stops and considers and chooses the right fallacy they gain an advantage.\n\nI like educational games, and what I really like about this idea is that I don't think the educational part would at all be forced.  It could be blended into the story and the game play seamlessly, and even enhance the feeling of being a detective if it was done right.\n\n\n[This](http://dontfallacy.me/) is a quiz, I found a bit similar to what I was thinking. [This](http://store.steampowered.com/app/302330/?snr=1_237_querypaginated__104_5) is a detective game a little bit  along the lines of what I imagined. \n\nIf you have any thoughts/variations/improvements on this, I'd love to hear them."

5s9057,First person detective game,"Most ""detective"" games are point and click with mostly static images. But this game will change that. The basic idea is that it involves using items to find others. For example, if you equip a brush you can zoom in on ""suspicious locations"" and find fingerprints on them. Or, you can use tweezers to find hairs or fibers. And, being you are a detective, you interview witnesses and suspects to find who did the crime. Being first person, there could be shooting or stealth sections, depending on whoever uses the idea.\n\n**Lore**\n\n\nAlthough any police story could work with this, my personal lore idea is that after a devastating war, whats left of America bans programs or files that can cause a security risk, leaving US citizens with only government websites or ones of large companies. This leads to the ""Funban"" era, a time where the illegal dealing of ""badvids"" and pornography is an common crime done by everyone, similar to how alcohol was still drunk during the Prohibition.  You are a detective sent to investigate the crime spree because of the Funban. In the game, this takes place in the late 21st century, where the Internet has been replaced by the AugNet, a augmented reality system in glasses or implants for the wealthy, used to ""improve"" experiences or browse the web on the go. This is done by accessing ""Nodes"", sections of the web that are owned by people. In the game you can use Nodes to distract enemies or to find out about certain people."
5s8wsj,Open World Superhero,"So I'll start off by asking to keep an open mind because any idea could become something completely original even if it's inspired by something already existing. I've read about Elder Scrolls ripoffs and that Bethesda doesn't check Reddit for ideas so save your breath. I just think this is a great idea and wanted to share. Also, I apologize if something similar has been posted I wasn't going to go through the entire subs.\n\n\nSo for those still with me...\n\n\nThe game starts out by creating your completely customizable character. You choose a species/race and then choose 3 core traits for your character to start with. Other traits will need to be built up from scratch.\n\n\nHUMANS: i.e. Bruce Wayne, Lex Luthor, Tony Stark, Starlord, Joker, Deadshot, Deathstroke, etc.\n\n-cognitive skills- enables the character's awareness of the superhero world. It unlocks maps and information about other superheroes that characters without this trait would have to unlock.\n\n-resources- lots of money (only particularly useful to start with for humans because others can obtain money quickly via their super powers)... but also the know how/where to obtain resources. Players without this have to start out stealing, working for money, and searching for resources/building networks.\n\n-fighting skills- self explanatory. Characters with this trait knows how to fight. Players without this trait will need a mech suit, weapons, or other resources to match up with other superheroes. Or learn how to fight.\n\n-weapons skills- This trait gives the characters advanced skills with weapons, i.e. accuracy, being able to lock on to targets quickly, etc... Characters without this trait will struggle with weapons until they build their skills. \n\n-pilot skills- Same as weapon skills. Characters with this trait know how to pilot mech suits and other aircraft. Characters without it will struggle until they build this skill. \n\n-stealth skills- I'm sure you get the idea...\n\n\nMETAHUMANS: i.e. Flash, Captain America, Aquaman, Winter Soldier, Green Goblin, etc.\n\n-super strength- Without a mech suit, counter super power, or alternate resource, a character with super strength will destroy you.\n\n-super speed- among other abilities...characters with this trait can rob banks/stores/homes and be gone within seconds for money, but not totally undetected. After the first time it will get a little more challenging to overcome traps at that same bank/store/home. Other characters with high cognitive skills and resources can catch these speedsters in their tracks for rewards when help is wanted.\n\n-telekinesis- typical. These characters can learn to fly.\n\n-aquatic- obviously everything aquaman... Additionally, only characters with this trait can access the underwater worlds of the game. Characters without this trait must obtain some resource that allows them to survive under water. \n\n-metahumans can also choose from human traits, but with only 3 options choose wisely...\n\n\nALIENS: i.e. Superman, Zod, Darkseid, Thor, etc.\n\n(this is where the idea gets a little ambitious)\n\n-Aliens start the game in their own open worlds.\n\n-Different Alien species have different default super powers so you'll choose the one that appeals to you. \n\n-These other worlds will have different Alien races within their species who will have different powers to choose from.\n\n-In addition to the species/race based super power you choose, you'll still have the option to pick 2 additional core traits.\n\n-If your alien character has high cognitive skills they will know of the other worlds (including earth) and be able to travel there if they have the resources and visa versa for humans/metahumans. It could require additional resources for characters to adapt to the environment on the other worlds.\n\n\nGAMEPLAY:\n\nThe game is set in a modern/futuristic interactive open world. Skyscraper cities (Metropolis, Gotham), underwater cities (Atlantis), cloud cities, etc...Based on whatever type of character and combo of traits selected you will be guided to a general area of the numerous open worlds that best suits your character to begin the story. Like any open world game, players are free to roam and cause chaos or play mini games, etc... Each area of the worlds has an established antagonist and protagonist that the user is able to choose to side with. The ultimate goal of the game is to assemble heroes (or villains) from all over the world(s) to fight the others and establish justice or chaos. The game is constantly evolving with new threats generated at random, so the world is never safe or under control.\n\nPS: I have no experience as a developer. I really just wanted to write this idea down and share it to see what people think. Please share your opinion!\n\n-JBG"

5s2utg,SimTower / Project Highrise type game in a Cyberpunk setting where you play as a MegaCorp making their headquarters,"Just what it says on the tin.\n\nMegaCorp archeologies are huge buildings that are essentially mini cities in and of themselves.  They provide everything a corporate wageslave needs - housing, entertainment, jobs, etc.\n\n- Ape the primary mechanics of those games flat out\n- Ape the basic rooms available, skin them cyberpunk\n- Extrapolate the size and scale of the tower to genre excess\n\nAs far as some thoughts on specific neat new things:\n\n- connections into the tower above (maybe WAY above) ground level, from very-elevated roads/rails, maybe docks for flying vehicles (fifth element style) or landing pads\n- security could be a focal feature, to prevent shadowrunners that become more common the bigger your tower - automated / remote-controlled drones, cameras, private security force\n- when starting a new tower, picking a city for it could change the art style (in the background, not in the tower), could have a large effect on the general demographics of people in the area, could determine what sort of external transportation options exist, etc.  there are quite a few well-established cyberpunkish art style archetypes and tropes.  "
5s2nhl,IO Style Multiplayer Pool and Soccer Game,"The premise of this game is that you are playing soccer on a pool table and each player is a pool ball. Instead of pockets there is one wider pocket in the center of the short sides of the table for each goal. It is turn based, and every turn all the player shoot their respective pool balls simultaneously. There is one ball that acts as the ""soccer ball"" and that is the one you are trying to hit into your opponents goal. Like other pool games you would be able to change the direction and power that you shoot your ball at. At the beginning of the game or when a team scores, all the players would be put in some pattern with the ball being placed in the center. I think the ideal turn time is around 30 seconds. It would be important to have a team chat so players could coordinate their movements and not smack into each other trying to go for the ball. The game could end after a predetermined number of turns and therefor a time limit, with possible overtime in the case of a tie. It could also be played to a certain number of goals.\n\nI think this system adds a lot of dynamic play. If everyone went for the ball all the time nothing would get done. Players could defend by tying to hit the ball away or intercepting the opponents before they could hit the ball. Player coordination is really key. In that sense there is a lot of strategy to it.\n\nOne thing I'm not so sure about is when a player gets hit or intentionally launches themselves into the goal. I think they should receive a penalty, such as being unable to play until one team scores and the next play begins. It could be strategic to eliminate members of the opponents team by hitting them into the goals. However, it also brings up the issue of team killing and trolling. Maybe if a player hits another player on their team into a goal, even if it was an ancient or they were knocked into that player by a member of the opposing team, the offending player would receive the penalty instead of the person who actually went into the net. \n\nThe game could be rendered in more realistic 3D with adjustable camera or just be 2D and top down only."

5s1zer,"Please post design ideas, not experience ideas","In the book ""Designing Games: A Guide to Engineering Experiences"" by Tynan Sylvester there's a paragraph titled ""The Fallacy of Vision"" (p. 304). It starts with a short story:\n\n&gt; *A young aerospace engineer is at his first day of work. He goes into the \nboss’s office with a gleam in his eye, and declares, ""I’ve got the greatest \nidea for a new kind of airplane.""*\n\n&gt; *The boss is intrigued. ""Explain,"" he says.*\n\n&gt; *The young engineer takes on a visionary expression and stares into \nthe distance. ""The passengers board hassle-free in five minutes. Then \nthe plane takes off, silently, with barely a bump, as the passengers enjoy \nmartinis in their private booths. As they soar over the Atlantic, a young \ncouple enjoys the view in one of the plane’s many bubble canopies, and \na cute kid gets a tour of the cockpit. The captain chuckles as the kid asks \nwhy they can’t fly to the moon. By the time they touch down, love has been \nfound, lessons have been learned, and everybody is ready for whatever \nawaits them at their destination.""*\n\n&gt; *The boss leans back in his chair and takes a long drag on his cigar. \n""You’re fired,"" he says.*\n\n&gt; &amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; This young aerospace engineer had a vision.

5ryvxs,An interesting mechanic/feature for a multiplayer horror hidenseek/tag game,"Games where one player is the monster and the others have to escape have been done before. BUT I had a dream last night that gave me an idea for a feature for one such game.\n\nLet players choose, or create and upload their own monster sound. The game could give you a library of stock options (monster growls, creepy giggling, ominous singing, etc). During gameplay, while playing as the monster, the other players hear this sound, and it gets louder and louder as you get closer (but it's only in mono, or otherwise won't let the players know EXACTLY where you are). Some people would use something funny, some would use something creepy, really it's up to them.\n\nOr, rather than just a single audio file, letting people choose a small collection of audio of audio files that the game randomly cycles through, so it doesn't get repetitive.\n\nThere'd have to be a process for the files to go through so that they never exceed a certain DB level, and also to cut out excessive dead space. That wa players can't just put in a library of silence, and then suddenly an earth-shattering ""JOHN CENA!!""\n\nAnother idea I just thought of: Let players choose which sounds play depending on how close they are."

5fe6ln,Working with Wife's idea-- An ordinary Squirrel.,"Hi r/gameideas! First time poster here, trying to get some creative insights for a project I'm calling ""Get Squirrely"".\n\n**The Background:** Long story short, I’ve been learning how to code and wanted to make a game while I learned. I ask my non-gamer wife what to make a game about, and she says it should be about a completely ordinary Squirrel that collects acorns. So I start thinking how to make that fun… Challenge accepted.\n\n**Name:** Currently calling this ""Get Squirrely"".\n\n**The Concept, for your critique and feedback:**\nYou are an ordinary squirrel, armed only with the player’s intelligence. At the very start, you wander around looking for food in a city park, but with little luck. You come across a nice woman on a bench eating pistachios, and she gives you one. You're hungry and you love it! Then she gets up and leaves suddenly, following somebody. You try to follow her, but the ground has people/vehicles/bigger animals, so you take to the high road. Most of the game is spent on the higher ground navigating your way around obstacles to catch up to the NPC woman. \n\nThe game will basically be a third person 3D platformer type of thing where you navigate across tree branches, fire escapes, and other various objects and obstacles while avoiding predators and other dangers. Simultaneously, you will have a hunger meter that slowly depletes, so you’ll need to find food along the way. With those big chubby Squirrel cheeks of yours, you can store a small “inventory” of items, like extra acorns and maybe some small key objects that are useful for various obstacles. Your hunger meter will grow a little bit with each level, but food will become increasingly scarce as you go along.\n\nThe human woman is a Hero/Spy character that drives the plot and leads you through different environments. She has her own narrative and is really the protagonist of the whole thing, with you being a spectator that sometimes impacts a situation indirectly as you try to reach her. \n\n**Squirrely’s Enemies:** Cats, foxes, hawks, cars, people that might step on you. \n\n**Squirrely’s Allies:** A small side obstacle will be necessary to turn an NPC into an ally. For instance, maybe you knock a box of dog treats off a shelf in order for a dog to decide to help you. Possible allies include: People, ducks, horses… anything else you can think of that’s not a predator of squirrels. A duck might help you cross a body of water, for instance. \n\n**Settings (In Order):** City Park -&gt; City Rooftops -&gt; Construction Zone-&gt; City Outskirts (Suburbs) -&gt; The inside of a van during a car chase -&gt; a Giant Bridge -&gt; a Small Mountain Town -&gt; The Bad Guy’s Evil Mansion -&gt; The Mansion Garden -&gt; The Secret Lair -&gt; The Final Showdown\n\n**Rough Plot Outline:** The Hero Woman is trying to catch the Villain and put a stop to his evil scheme. She is totally capable of handling the situation on her own, even with the odds stacked up, but your actions can help balance out some of the adversity and give her a hand. Its definitely a rough outline at this point, and I’ll be starting by just making the first City Park level to see how that goes and explore whether the game is worth pursuing after that. Ultimately, this is just for fun and learning. Any thoughts/feedback are totally appreciated!\n\n**Extra Features:** I think it would be fun to throw in some references to games I know and love. For instance, maybe Squirrely finds a shoe box and uses its similarly to how Solid Snake does, hiding in plain sight as he evades enemies. I was also thinking of making the dog look like Dogmeat from the Fallout series (at least the same breed, if nothing else). Any other ideas for nods to other games would also be appreciated :) I think that is where I'll have the most fun with things. \n\n**Platform:** I'm making this in Unreal, so for now the Platform would be PC. I'm also working on making a RetroPie, so I think it would be cool to buy an old game cartridge and print up a custom label and plug it straight into the TV via HDMI. I hear its possible to host Unreal games on a RaspPi, but quite a pain in the ass, so maybe I just modify one of my old PS2's or something instead. We'll see what the options for that sort of thing are when we have a product to work with haha. And if there was any interest, I could always port it to other platforms or throw it up on github or something. \n\nedits: Added details. Read the wiki, and clarified a little more."
5fdz18,2d Multiplayer Game Ideas,I'm a Web Developer and currently looking forward creating a 2d Multiplayer Game but don't have any ideas yet.\n\nEvery Idea or Inspiration would be appreciated :)
5fdcbv,A MOBA specifically designed for 1v1,"I have been currently developing a MOBA myself so I have no time for this but I am just going to throw up this idea as I am not going to get to it anyways.\n\nThe idea is simple. You have 2 lanes, a jungle, and minions spawning to the enemy nexus. Pretty standard MOBA stuff, however due to the fact that is 1v1, certain creative liberties can be taken that would complicate other MOBAs tremendously. Every champion has a different wave of minion that spawns for there side and possibly different building behaviour. Variances can be from simply stat differences to a special ability ran on a cool down. Due to the nature of the game, there are no ultimates, or ultimates are not as bursty/game changing. The game is more focused on out-macroing the opponent and isolate outplays. Certain items could be made to aid this (See: zz'rot)\n\nI feel as though an independent developer could easily work the logic in a few months (perhaps even weeks). The biggest problem for scope is the fact that you'd need that more art for minion types and what-not. Another problem is that since its a MOBA, you'd need a lot of classes. Depending on how obsessed you are, each new class could take anywhere between 1 - 4 months. This of course depends on other variables such as the depth of the class and whether your game is 3d or 2d.\n\nEDIT: Re-estimated time making a class would take"

5fb1lo,Humanz,"**- Intro -**\n\nHi Guys,\n\nI am an indie game designer, i design 6 android games and one of them is making some money. Since i am still a learner, and total indie.\n\nI have some Utopian ideas, which i know that i need a big team to do but, i will try to make ""pocket"" versions of them and post.\n\nOkay here we go,\n\n**- Base -**\n\nFirst, it is a single player 3D survival/discover/exploring game.\n\nThink about a 3D world like RUST but with much more collectible items and more animals. Game starts in Dark Age, character is kinda gorilla/human. Aim is, get through to next age. Every object you collect and use is dynamically change the ability of your character and increase it's stats to use and creates new recipes. You need to hunt/eat/collect. But, the point is, you need to breed. For breeding, basically you need to find a mate. Principle is, your genetics will improve your son/daughters and when your character is old/dead, you basically continue playing with one of your child. When you breed, you will give tasks to your family to improve faster.\n\nSince your/family abilities depends on your actions, if you hunt for generations, you will have more agile, more silent and fast running characters. Since it has positives, it also got negatives.\n\nFor example of genetic mutation, if a snake bite you and got venom, but able to survive, you gain immunity which can be transfer to your children.\n\nIf you craft too many stuff, your child may able to do that faster. Since you are able to give tasks to your family, you can make a nice balance between abilities.\n\nFor further improvement of this game, i would like to learn more about human brain and genetics.\n\npre - answers ;\n\nI know that abilities do not pass by genetics but it is a fantasy anyway.\n\nFor further, since aim is pass through ages, you may start a clan, village etc. I am not really sure how to design future of the game.\n\n**- End -**\n\nIt is an intro of a game design, i got too much stuff to tell but since ideas should be ""smaller"" i would like to share if you guys want.\n\nI would also like to hear your comments / additions on it.\n\nIf someone really interested in, we can work together :) I can not say i am experienced developer but since i work in teams and know what needs to be done, \n\n\n*Sorry for bad English ! *"
5faix4,The Farm,"So I'm currently in the process of developing a game about a boy who has his dog sent to a ""farm"" so he goes on this magical adventure to get his dog back while the world around him and the things he encounters on the way are just big metaphors for the 5 stages of grief. \n\nI have already been working alot on the main character and his animations, as well as prototyping a bit of the game. But as I'm coming to the end of the prototyping stage I'm realizing I really haven't fleshed out much of the games core ideas. \n\nSo now I'm coming here to reddit to find ideas or inspiration of ways I can have the world, the quests, or any other possible encounters in the game represent the 5 stages of grief. Which for those of you who don't know are: Denial, Anger,  Bargaining, Depression and Acceptance. Acceptance will just be when the boy finally reunites with his dog and comes to discover the truth about his companion and learns that he passed away.\n\nEDIT: I should mention that the game will play similar to how Castle Crashers is played with the false-3d world using 2d objects and characters in a sidescrolling world.

5f3weh,"[AAA] An MMORPG that combines both Action and Lock-Ons/Tab-Targeting in its combat, and rewards both PvE and PvP players","I have a [bunch of ideas](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzvcUw3CInpKdTRvSXVFZVZIQXM) for my dream MMO, but mainly, I just want a modified Dragon's Dogma for the combat system. Melee is like a hack-and-slash game, ranged combat is like a shooter, and magic is like a tab-targeted game. To make magic and ranged not overpower melee, movement speed while using ranged weapons linearly decreases accuracy and more powerful spells have to be cast while standing still. All three systems have a block and parry button to kinda protect themselves from melee rushers and assassins.\n\nPvP would contain Solo and Party Dueling within a certain radius, Guild vs Guild (25v25) battles, and Faction vs Faction (50v50) battles (both with fodder AI and as part of different territory control systems), all in the ""open world"" (aka instance of that area). Territory controlled determines the resources and NPC troops available for the next battle.\n\nPvE would contain the typical instanced and open world questing and raiding, but some raids would introduce level scaling and raid-specific loot. Some quests and raids occur in procedurally generated dungeons, but shouldn't have special loot. All PvE content is available in parties (5 players maximum, multiple parties can group up to 20 players), with increased chances to earn the quest/raid specific reward.\n\nI have a lot more ideas in the link above, but the gist of what I dream about is in this post.

Nobody is clean (both physically and morally). Yet somehow war is still occurring. ""Politicians"" rape and murder as they please. Robots are attempting to destroy everything, yet somehow never succeed, just causing death and misery ( I haven't worked out how robots got into the picture). Hope does not exists. It's actually so fucked that reality has just given up and the further you go into the wasteland, the more reality just gives up. Impossible geometry and time skipping and the such. We practically colonized for hell. In fact, we did. Hell has started an invasion. Open world. Lots of grey. The occasional thermonuclear bomb. No modern technology like computers or cellphones, but still set in the near future. I'd say about early 90's tech is somewhat acceptable. Set in North East U.S. I just picture a huge flatland with the occasional building sticking out of the ground. This is a very loose idea, but I feel it would make a fantastic game. plz be gentle."

5ex9i6,A game where you solve puzzles by drawing holes in the wall.,"I'm thinking a 3D puzzle game in a similar format to portal. Instead of the portal gun, however, you have this magic pencil (avoiding paintbrush because magic mickey took that already). With it, you draw a shape on the wall, and it becomes a hole in the wall. Some walls you couldn't draw on, though. Perhaps later in the game you could unlock the ability to draw other things into the wall, like making a section of it reflective, bouncy, or even magnetic. You'd have to interact with objects too, and use the objects as well as the drawing to get through."

5ewaf4,Forum Game?,"I've seen a lot of ""games"" that people seem to love ""playing"" together that I would never call a game, so maybe this is a game...\n\nIt's basically an anonymous forum, but you get a persistent hidden identity. It's not supposed to be perfect, and you can create a new anonymous character any time. Every name is always the same, so anonymous, or anon, or nothing at all, or user defined. You will never get a way to ID yourself outside of the forum, except to say ""I posted that"" to someone.\n\nThe game part of it is that by posting, you give other people an opportunity to apply tags to your identity. No names or nonsense words. The tags you give and get are private to the tagger. Ok so there are achievements that show up in your signature space. If you get enough people to tag you with something, it becomes an achievement. If an identity is inactive for too long, all of their tags get removed from the system, and their posts start to slowly fade away. You could even lose your achievement because of this.\n\nAlso, if you click the rating icon, it changes how ratings are displayed, to suit your ratings preferences. Somehow the forum can integrate all ratings systems, likes, points, rating, rank, stars, etc.\n\nSince you have a persistent identity, you can PM each other, but be careful to tag them, or you won't know who you're PM'ing with. If the identity disappears, all of their PM's slowly fade away in your inbox.\n\nIf you suck, and people hate you, there's a little report button near the PM button by your name. It doesn't go to any admins or mods, it works like a tag, but it eventually gives you the banned achievement. All of your posts fade halfway instantly, and you can't post anymore until you create a new identity.\n\nIf you want to be a moderator of a forum, you just need enough users to tag you as a mod, from one of your posts made in that forum. Then you can edit and delete posts, and prevent future posts from a user, in your forum section.\n\nShould I go on?"

5eoie5,A war game where you play as each of the soldiers on one side.,"Got the idea from Chronotron.\n\nYou start out as one soldier, marching into the war by yourself. You kill as many people as you can. When you die, you respawn as a different soldier, and see the soldier you previously were marching into the battle beside you, doing exactly what you did. If you kill the enemy that would've otherwise killed your past self, or otherwise save your previous self's life, he then becomes a simple AI that just shoots at enemy soldiers after the time that he would've died passes. Each time you die, you respawn as a new soldier, with all of your previous selves doing what you did before."

5emiuo,Keeping balance with forces &amp; controls,"As a dev, just got an idea for minigame-ish game, but was too lazy to implement it.\nThe core idea is that the players should keep balance of a plate or craft with some forces and controls, till the object you control flipped when you lose.\n(Win condition might be playing for certain duration of time not losing, but can't assure on this)\n\nSituations and the Target may vary.\nAlthough just selecting one of these would be much better, I'll post the possibilities:\n\nTarget to balance:\n- [Various shapes of] Plates\n- A plane(helicopter)\n- A ship\n- A bridge\n- A spacecraft (keep solar panels to sun)\n- A rod (tower)\n- A skycrane\n\nSituations:\n- Rain, Snow (change of weight distribution)\n- Earthquake/Wave/Squall\n- Old(or Broken) joints\n- Accidents (including Human-ish Errors)\n\nControls will vary depend on target and situations, but applying forces will be important.\n\nIs this just another crappy idea, or could this ever be okay?"
5ekoq3,"Remember, the gate is down","Basically, just the zero-g battles from the Ender's game, but in 2D. You have a room with handholds on the walls and randomly placed obstacles (""stars""), the teams enter the field from the opposite sides, the goal is to get one of your players to the enemy's entry point. I'd restrict teams to 3 on each side to avoid chaos but allow for some of the strategies from the book. \n\nMovement consists of moving near the wall or the stars using the handholds, jumping off the wall, and using a grappling hook/rope to alter your trajectory or return to the wall. \n\nAiming and shooting would be using the mouse - left button to shoot, right for the hook (maybe it would work with a controller too, with analog sticks and triggers, but it won't be as precise). \n\nShooting a bodypart should ""freeze"" it, (which I think would be the hardest thing to develop in a basic prototype, as there will be a need to stimulate body parts), essentially restricting it from moving - it can be a good and a bad thing, as a part once freezed will act as a shield from further attacks, and a frozen hand has steadier aim (but without the option to actually aim with it, you can only shoot in one direction). Immobilised player stays on the field and can act as a payload, as you still win of you get him to the enemy's gate, or as a shield for other players. \n\nAnd, of course, there should be an option to let you choose which way is down for you, as it doesn't matter in the zero g."
5gp8b8,Multiplayer strategy game where you draw the borders,"My idea is basically a normal 4x strategy game, complexity can vary from Risk to a Paradox grand strategy. The concept I'm interested in is instead of having predefined provinces, borders are decided by actually drawing them out. Different areas would have resources, population, cities, terrain, culture, and all other normal ""province definers"" based upon actual location, not by set province borders. It would be up to the players to divide territory well - whether through war or through trading valuables/resources collected from your own territory."
5glpbd,Death Note / scream / whodunnit game,"I was wondering what people thought of a game where every player on the server is pitted against one killer and they have to track him down through clues, meanwhile, the killer picks off people one by one and tries to cover his tracks so s/he doesn't get caught.\n\nIf the killer kills everyone without getting caught and uncovered, they win. If s/he gets caught, they lose.\n\nFriday 13th works on a similar premise but this would be different because the mystery revolves around the identity of the killer, not just the gruesome deaths."

5gi8wq,Browser-based nation simulator game in an ongoing world.,"Ok, so I'm thinking a nation simulator game where there's one and only one map. Not multiple servers, no starting a new game, just one ongoing game. A map of our world is divided into hundreds of territories, with different stats. You join, you're randomly assigned an unoccupied territory to start with, and you begin playing. You can build an army, annex territory from other players or unoccupied ones. However, here's the kicker: You can't save. When you leave the game, your nation falls into ruins, and the territories it owned get a bonus for future nations that take them. This bonus stacks, so you'll end up with a few territories that an increasing number of nations are ruthlessly fighting for. You can then start a new game whenever, and have a clean slate."
5ghobx,Survive or Thrive [RPG horror] [Intermediate],"You are trapped in a maze with monsters in it who are out to kill you. \n\nThere are hearts and blood you can pick up that make you stronger or reverse damage done by monsters if they hurt you. (Hearts add a pip of health, blood regains lost health). The blood and the hearts, if possible, will look anatomically correct.\n\nYou can also pick up weapons in the maze, and look for ""upgrades"" to drop, but here is where the game departs from being a run of the mill RPG maze horror. The weapons you pick up won't work against the monsters. The only way for the player to figure this out is to test it out. \n\nThere are also other humans trapped in the maze with you (NPCs) that you can do short interactions with (possibly buy stuff from as well). If a player were to try to test out their weapon on a human, it would work. You would then be able to harvest their organs and become stronger (why i want the hearts and blood to be anatomically correct) However, nothing would point the player in this direction, so even testing the weapon on a human would be their own choice. \n\nThe more organs and blood you harvest from killing humans, the easier surviving from monsters is because you will have much more health than if you were to survive from drops alone. Eventually you will have so much health and have killed so many people, that you start looking different (until over time you become like a monster of the maze yourself) \n\nBecoming a monster is the ""Thrive"" option.\n\nStaying a human is the ""survive"" option. \n\nI know these are just the bare-bones. But i would love any sort of constructive feedback :) thanks!"
5ggpie,A Google Earth MMO?,"Google Earth has become so well-developed, and is so detailed, that you can pretty much look at roads, houses, overpasses down to a couple of feet. It's a huge database.\nSo, would it be possible to use this database for an entertainment purpose?\n\n**Here's what I've come up with so far:**\nThe Earth would be imported into some sort of engine that is universal and flexible (Unity? I don't know how that would work, maybe an in-house engine would be needed).\nThe game itself would be split into to parts: playing the game, and contributing:\n\n**Contributing first:**\nA part of Google Earth's database are roads, down to which lane goes where. And since the quality of roads isn't that great on a human-scale level, the roads would look pretty bad. One of the solutions would be making a road template based on Google Earth's database and placing the roads on ground level, replacing the existing default geometry. This would result in better models and textures (but worse performance).\n\nNow, there would of course be cases where the roads would be replaced poorly. In this case, a player would be able to correct the issue, which then later would be approved by a serious person. Buildings cannot be auto-replaced, as there is an endless amount of different types of buildings, so, you know, it's sort of impossible. Here is where the players come in. The engine would fully support importing from SketchUp, which again supports importing pictures (in proper scale), so even a non-technologically advanced person could model their own house. Trees are a problem that I haven't fully solved yet, as they look pretty ugly. Again, either contribution from players; ""This is a park in my neighborhood. There are oak and pine trees here. The trees are this dense."", or auto-replacing. Water would be auto-detected/fetched from Google Maps' database and replaces with live water with waves and sound effects.\n\nSound effects generally would be set by the community; ""This is a forest: set leaves blowing and birds chirping as sound. This is downtown New York: add car horns, people talking etc.""\n\n**Playing:**\nBy default, there would be one game mode in the game: freeplay/godmode. In this game mode, you can explore the world by teleporting anywhere, but you are a human. Everything is viewed on a human scale. You can choose between 3rd and 1st person. You can spawn various vehicles which are drivable (there is already a built-in flight simulator in Google Earth). Some vehicles would be included to showcase the possibilities. The servers would as big as possible (I know Just Cause 2 could have 1000 people/server), so that the game would feel as real as possible. Some basic interaction between people would exist (chat &amp; IM messaging between players).\n\nEverything that affects gameplay could be contributed to by the players; game modes (role-play, simulations, etc.), vehicles (cars, boats, helicopters, planes, bikes etc.), buildings, roads etc.\n\nThat's all I could think of now, although if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask!\n\nP.S. English is my third language, so I'm sorry if I've been writing gibberish for the last hour.\n\nEDIT: Forgot to mention that I've been also thinking about VR support.

5gfkiu,Lighting in games should be better,"One of my favorite gaming quotes was by Neil Druckmann (Naughty Dog), in reference to The Last of Us, he said: ""We felt going into this that the story in video games should be better.""\n\nThis concept has helped me make a number of game development decisions, not that there needs to be a focus on story, but that anything can be improved on. Now I am fixated on the concept that lighting should be better in video games. I have posted about this concept here before only to have it misunderstood that I want to make a lighting-based game.\n\nSo I decided to make this thread to discuss this theory. To discuss better ways of achieving it, and conceptually how a game can be structured to support it. Artistic style, color pallet, and contrasts would certainly be powerful tools in this endeavor.\n\nMaybe I am alone in this, but I find this topic fascinating. Does anyone else feel like I do that this resource could be better utilized?"

5ge69y,(Massively) multiplayer sorta-retro pong.,"This will be more of an instruction than a simple idea, probably already been done and I never heard of it, because I thought of it as a young teen. Maybe in the spirit of similar new games like agar.io it could be pong.io ? I don't really care.\n\nNo logging in to play! You can create an account to see your stats and get non-gameplay extras.\n\n...\n\nFirst, pong. You are a rectangle that can slide right and left. If the ball moves behind your spot, you lose.\n\n...\n\nNow, bring in ultimate pong chaotic multiplayer game.\n\nIn this version, you can play solo if there is only one player, bounce your ball against the wall until you lose to yourself...\n\nIn a small game, the game looks like a regular game of pong, but the more players you have, the wider and more curved the goal lines get. The original square game field stretches seamlessly as players log in and out of the game.\n\n...\n\nThe game can easily be set up for two teams, but that gets old. Introducing squads! Your team gets its own ball with their logo on it. Option to give teams multiple balls per squad.\n\n...\n\nSpecial mechanics for special game types. In a game where every player is on their own team, you get a little mini view of your ball and you can curve it a tiny bit right or left. It can be boring waiting in such a game since you may wait a while to ever see a ball, so this makes it more interesting.\n\n...\n\nRegular Polygon mode. The game randomly puts you on teams of limited size, more players, more teams, more sides to the polygon, team colors, colored ball.\n\n...\n\nPlayer points. If your paddle was the last to touch the ball when your team scores, you get a point. Does things, I guess, use to buy extras?\n\n...\n\nExtra stuff... power ups! Worm holes! Gravity spin and slingshot! Lasers! Teleports! Puppies chasing the balls! Oh my! Forward players: temporarily break free of your goal line! Grenades: blast players, blast balls, explosions! Dark mode with lights at goal posts, can't see balls that are too far away! \n\n...\n\nHmmm... scoring... well you could make it so that if you have points, you lose one when someone scores on you. A good MMO web game lasts forever... should eventually be configurable by arena. Maybe the more points your team has, the wider your goal line is! Or maybe paddles get smaller? That would add some challenge."

5gde5v,An arena-style game that focue on surprise and deception.,"I am talkng about a game where you have your own attacks that have certain effects but can be easily countered or avoided so it is up to you to decide when and where to strike. \n\nThe idea is that every player has their own clever style of taking down opponents, such as stabbing someone in the back because if you attack from the front the opponent can block it. \n\nAnother style would be to let the opponent attack so you can counter and kill him. \n\nOr set up a mobile decoy which can explode.\n\nOr toss smoke bombs to hide in them or cut off vision. \n\nSetup traps, hide in grass and bushes, on top of trees or buildings, etc. \n\nOr place a ""tag mine"" which if triggered can paint you on the map. \n\nBasically it is supposed to discourage the ""run and gun"" style of fighting and instead employs deception to take down your opponents.\n"

5g4rlr,"A inspiration from Tomba! from whoopecamp, with new concepts and new gameplay","Hello! \nI was dreaming a few days about this game idea, different from all other nowdays games. A adventure-quest-rpg based game with something taken from the Whoopecamp Co Ltd. (closed in 1999) art, Tomba! series.\nMy idea was to make Tomba fight again for the third time the evil pigs, making to move freely in a tridimensional world and trying to catch all evil pigs. \nI wanted to make the style of the game similar to the original one (catching pigs with his tooths and launch into the evil pig's bag, finding treasure, diamonds, gems to gain points that can be used to open boxes when a tot of points are reached, find keys that can open treasure chests containing gems or items that are useful to continue the game, special places like Force/Courage/Wisdom/golden towers, and so on...)\nAlso adding a lot of new things and characters to the game would be fantastic (eg. other planets, dimensions, collectibles, and so on...) \nBut i don't want to do the exact copy of the original game, it could variate enemies (eg instead of Evil Pigs it could be Evil Mages or Evil Rabbits and so on) or variate the protagonist hero. \nHowever i want to keep the original game style, because is the heart of the game and it's missing from nowdays games.\n\nTalking about the graphics... i think the gameplay matters, not the graphics. In fact, always speaking nowdays, i've tryed several games that are graphics-only without a real gameplay into it. Can't find one that is truly a game (and not a graphic competition).\n Feel free to comment, and tell me what you think about my game idea. \n(sorry, i know my english is bad but using a translator probably it would make my idea incomprehensible)"
5g2eip,Space Hockey,"My idea is a simple game where, on each side of the field, there is a hoop while, in the middle, there is a puck. You score by getting the puck through the opponent's hoop.

Second of all, each player can move freely in all directions.  Third and most importantly, each player has a gravity well surrounding them and, using this gravity well, they must somehow score.  They must, of course, do this while keeping the opponent from scoring."

5ftgbz,[Intermediate] Virtual Strip Club &amp; Casino,"(If something like this already exists, please let me know.)\n\nThe higher the graphics and animation quality, the more likely this game will turn a profit.\n\nGame has a Mature version, with no nudity or graphic animations, as well as an Adults Only version.\n\nGame has two separate modes: Single Player and Online Multiplayer.\n\nIn Single Player, you take on the role of Manager by default. Business locations can be viewed top-down or in first person. During business hours and with at least one customer and one employee present, you can switch viewpoint between employees, customers, and Manager. If there's an existing high relationship score between the Manager and a customer or employee, you will be able to control them.\n\nFor example: Frank visits the Seedy Pomegranate every Tuesday to see his favorite dancer, Daisy. The Manager has made a point of greeting Frank when he comes in and telling the bartender to make his favorite drink, so Frank thinks the Manager is pretty cool. When the Manager switches to Frank's POV, Frank can be instructed to spend money, drink, play games, interact with others in the club, or go home, for example. This makes it possible to improve relationships, control cash flow, and play the game from another perspective. When Frank's stayed for his usual three to four hours, he tells his friends he's heading home, and is no longer a playable option for the Manager.\n\nAnother example: Daisy works as a dancer on Tuesdays and Fridays. The Manager helped her out with some car bills and pays for her weekly tanning sessions, so she thinks the Manager is okay. Her work performance has been suffering due to an ugly break-up. When the Manager switches to Daisy's POV, Daisy's work performance can be manually improved through changing up her dance routine, interacting with others in the club, taking a break, changing her outfit, et cetera. The person causing her performance to suffer can be identified (if they're present) by a red aura, and interacting with them as Daisy may solve the problem, giving her a temporary performance boost. When her work shift is over, she announces she's heading home, and is no longer a playable option for the Manager.\n\nThe Manager isn't locked into these perspectives for any length of time, and can switch between them at will, as long as there's at least one customer and one employee and it is still during business hours.\n\nSingle Player mode is essentially a business sim. You purchase one of several cheap, seedy properties, attempt to build them into a thriving business through hiring / firing employees, improving the amenities, and marketing, eventually purchase bigger and better buildings, and construct an empire.\n\nBuildings are pre-built 3D environments, and each one presents different advantages and drawbacks. Some are in a bad location, where customers might include drug dealers, pimps, or random drunken jerks, but employing people is cheaper. Employees here are more likely to suffer detrimental effects to their work performance which require intervention, or start off with detriments such as illness or old age. Keeping a business like this afloat requires more time and investment than one in a higher-level building.\n\nThe middle range of buildings introduce the challenge of community involvement. Local groups aren't happy to have a strip club and / or casino in their midst, and will try to shut the place down. Ask or pay your employees to help fix the problems: join church groups, spend time volunteering at the local soup kitchen, help with school fundraisers.. or just bribe the local cops and judges.\n\nThe higher range of buildings introduce much wealthier clientele, and with them, weird requests. Maybe they want to take one or several of your employees on vacation to Barbados, or they've decided to marry your most popular dancer.. or they ran over your bouncer on a drunken binge. Cater to them and make millions, balance their requests with your employees' needs and desires, or refuse to give an inch.\n\nThough the buildings are pre-planned, they can be altered. You can choose to add on rooms with furnishings (more expensive), or add on empty rooms and finish them with items, furniture, and decor yourself. Rooms can be blocked off using locked doors or cheap caution tape, depending on your budget.\n\nIn cheaper locations, fire is a real risk, and having too many lights or an overloaded fuse box could destroy your business. You'll get phone calls or visits from the local fire marshal and electric company representatives until you correct the issue by spreading out your lights, hiring a contractor to fix your electrical issues, or bribing them to leave you alone, because obvs you know what you're doing.\n\nBuilding a successful business in one location and earning enough points or money will unlock affordable buildings one rank higher. You can always check on businesses in other locations. Neglecting one business location for another will lead to a decline. \n\nThere is a cycling pool of available employees, with different appearances, qualities, and specializations. As the manager you can suggest a change to an existing employee (training, appearance alteration, job / location change) or pay to force the change. You can also assist employees with difficulties that affect their work performance, such as addiction, a broken-down car, or an abusive relationship, by either tracking down the customer who is 'causing' the issue or by paying a hired bouncer, private eye, or hit man to 'take care of it'.\n\nAs employees spend time working in various specializations (bartender, wait staff, dancer, cook, valet, bouncer, repair, wardrobe, janitor, et cetera), they earn money and auto-distributed skill points. It's important to note any skills an employee has on hire, and to keep them in a specialization as long as possible. They may also ask for raises or other perks over time.\n\nGetting a location closed or destroyed boots you down one rank. If you're working on your first location and the place goes up in smoke, Game Over.\n\nOnline Multiplayer is essentially the same game, with the following changes:\n\n- Businesses built in Single Player mode cannot be transferred to Multiplayer without paying a small (actual money) fee. Only the building itself and items within are transferred.\n\n- Player character appearance can be customized before joining a server. Items that can alter a character's appearance can be used on the server, and those changes will be kept after they leave the server.\n\n- The Manager is automatically considered the ""host"", and has the ability to mute or ban other players from their business. The Manager is given the choice of starting-level buildings and must build up, same as in the Single Player campaign.\n\n- Players must choose a role, either employee or customer, before entering the business. Employee specializations are based on available 'service items' in the building; if there's no kitchen or stove, there can't be a cook, for example. This will lead to employees with a broader range of skills and talents, as well as buildings that make an effort to accommodate many different types of employees.\n\n- Exchange of in-game money is cumulative. If an employee has þ650 at the beginning of the night, and a customer gives them a þ50 tip, that amount will be calculated into their balance -- either when one of them leaves the server or when they use a 'cash register' item to 'cash out'.\n\n- Multiple visits to the same business with the same Manager earn bonus points and extra money for everyone involved.\n\n- An ATM located in every Multiplayer building allows purchase and use of special items, such as wardrobe additions (requires a changing room / wardrobe chest / locker to be used), group interaction or 'party' items, gifts that can be exchanged with others in the club, etc.\n\n- Addition or deletion of items from the building can only be done by the Manager while the building is unlisted / 'closed', whereas building is possible during business hours in Single Player mode.\n\n- Chat is open; private chats can be initiated; some employees can attach a cost to their private chats based on time units, i.e., þ30 for ten minutes, at which point the private chat terminates, funds are exchanged, and the chat can be re-established by the employee. Some rooms, such as private lounge areas or VIP rooms, automatically switch to private chat if they're entered by at least one customer and at least one employee; the Manager can set an auto-deduct fee for these rooms, which is then split between the employees.\n\nA small note: The game is designed to appeal to everyone. There are porn-star body types, scrawny types, chubby types, and plain ol' normal types. Game characters have different nationalities, sexualities, and identities. The Manager in Single Player can build an ideal club just the way they want it; in Multiplayer, they will be interacting with a world full of actual people.\n\nThat's all I've got right now. I know it's a risky concept but I see an actual need for a safe place to role-play these scenarios, and I think the business sim side of it is pretty solid. \n\nPotential threats, aside from people generally being dicks to one another, include economy-wrecking false money cheats, skill cheats, and inventory cheats. I don't care if somebody cheats in Single Player, but the Multiplayer version should have a secure and protected economy, at least.\n\nThoughts?"
5ftdyr,Superhero Smackdown,"I know that there are superhero games out there, but I think this is new and original (I'm not sure, though I never bother to do research before-hand) So, to sum it up, it's a first person shooter where you choose your superpower before the battle, and you can use it to your advantage. The characters wouldn't be to complex in any aspect, but they could shine in their abilities (i.e. strength, flying, intangibility, invisibility, etc.) It could be set in cities that you might see in superhero movies, but real cities, not fake ones. Anyway, this is getting long, but I am getting better at making it short and to the point, at least I think so. Anyway, you probably know the drill. Write your opinion whether it's negative or positive, I will always read every comment. Also, please tell me of games that are similar, so I know which areas to not touch on. You know, I should really frame these rules up somewhere, so I can always include them. Okay, bye!"

5fqs0z,Gladiator Concept,"I'm not a super experienced game dev. Nor do I really just have a set theme in mind yet but please bear with me. I've been recently thinking of a pretty intense game idea that I'm absolutely positive people will LOVE. Haven't seen it done before neither. Elder scrolls and Ryse: Son of Rome came close but not quite. Ok enough bullshit. So basically I'm thinking of a first person action game based in Roman gladiator times where you are in a variety of Colosseums. You can train in the barracks between battles and shit like that. Upgrading skills, strength, stamina, weapons, gear, etc. And there's different fighters to use like if you're good with a bow you can have that and a small knife if you fuckin suck and missed all your arrows. You can be a two handed battleaxe/hammer/greatsword wielding mofo, a short sword/spear and shield guy shit you can even duke it out with your fists but that won't stop the other guy from still being a dick and pulling a knife anyway trololol. It won't necessarily have a ""story"" mode but there is a single player mode. Multiplayer online mode up to like 16 players or more maybe. If you know much about the real events you'll know about how they would alter the arena to fit whatever game, fight, or event they were going to do. Example in single or co-op play you can get put up against a hungry pack of wolves or huge ass lions, tigers, bears oh my. And I mean like 4-5 BIG ass lions or so to make it challenging. You'll still get to choose your fighter/weapons. Also you can be put up against a few prisoners sentenced to death or other gladiators all fighting back. Battle will be first person. Brutal fast paced realistic action such as tripping an enemy, knocking him off balance, knocking his shield/weapon away with the right hit which you can always pick up again if you can make it to them that is. You can see and do actual damage from cuts/stabs/breaks and it actually effects them in real ways such as severely breaking an arm now they can't use it(without taking away from their own HP of course) and if they do its slow and unreliable. Dirty fighting such as throwing dirt in the eyes and getting kneed full force in the balls. You're fighting to the death in every battle of course. Gore and dismemberment is a given. Customizable gear and weapons. You can name your gladiator and there can be this XP and upgrade bonus type deal called Glory that you get the more men you kill and battles you complete without dying. So like you could be the one to kill some prestigious dude who's went like 100-0 without dying then you automatically get that guys Glory but not his battle record. Just the glory from being the one to kill him. (I was also thinking of applying this same entire concept to like an ancient war game with full on armies of guys in a field brutally murdering each other in a huge field or some shit but my only problem with that is in order for it to be more fun it would need like hundreds of guys on each side all online players who cannot respawn and can spectate. But I'm not sure if we're able to have that many online players in one game without some sort of massive lag or glitching.) I feel like Im leaving shit out but only way to be sure is if you guys contribute your opinions and ideas, also questions ask me questions we can fuck around n get some shit started. This was a lot to type so I just typed how I talk. Didn't have time to make sure it was all super articulate n shit. Thanks for taking the time out of your day to read tho I appreciate it ! "

5fnu7c,Sandbox survival game... that's also a dating sim with waifus and husbandos.,"Whether they're traveling with you, helping you out at your base, helping you gather resources, etc. I just think the idea of having a waifu to bond with and work with you is an attractive one. Some of the best games that feature that include Fire Emblem Fates, Persona 4, and even DanganRonpa's School Mode/Island Mode. It would give players like me a reason to come back to a game even more.\n\nI look at these sandbox survival games like Don't Starve but they don't have attractive characters to get invested in. Or at least I've yet to find one that does. So if anyone here can make a sandbox survival/dating sim hybrid of a game, that would be really neat."
5hsnhu,FPS AR Game inspired by Pokemon GO,"Ok, so the first thing you'd do in this game is pick a faction. The three factions would be the Kingdom, the Republic and the Tribe.\n\nOnce you start, you'll be able to switch between three screens. The main screen would show crosshairs for aiming, with a number at the bottom representing how much ammo you have left and two buttons to allow you to switch screens.\n\nA second screen would show a GPS map with the location of nearby players, and the locations of areas called warzones. When you're in a warzone, killing a player from another faction gives points to your faction for that warzone. Whichever faction has the most points for a given warzone ""controls"" it, and the faction that controls a warzone is also shown on the map screen when you're in it, as well as how many points the 3 factions have there. To kill another player, you find them using the gps map, then tap the screen with them in the crosshairs to shoot at them until their health reaches 0. It would allow for a margin of error to compensate for the fact that it's tracking the phone, not the person. ""Dead"" players get booted out of the app for 30 minutes, and are then able to continue playing.\n\nThe third screen allows you to switch guns. You have a chance of taking another player's ammo, and a rare chance of taking their gun, when you kill them. However, you could also spend some of your team's points for the nearest warzone on buying guns and ammo. Each faction would also have a different ""default"" gun to start with, with slightly different properties to add variety.\n\nYou could very well track and battle players outside of the designated warzone to take their ammo and guns, but it won't earn you any points, so be careful!\n\nThe warzones would be in real-life places that are strategically interesting, like Fort Morgan, the French Quarter, Golden Gate Bridge and Manhattan (perhaps not as spread out as those examples, though: you shouldn't have to live near an iconic city to play!)\n\nI realize that this may be really hard to make on a phone, if at all possible, since you'd need precision tracking for it, but maybe a specially-designed handheld system could be used for it."

5hrkgr,TowerAttack,"Had this idea back when tower defense games became trendy on mobile, which was years ago, so this may have already been done by someone.\n\nEssentially the game is the inverse of the tower defense - you are given a certain number of units (say 300) with which you have to clear the level. Levels have various configurations of paths through them and are populated by towers which shoot at units. There are different types of units with different abilities (run faster, shoot, heal nearby units, fly, plant mines etc.). Units can be upgraded in terms of stats and skills available etc. Player's task is to figure out the timing and the composition of waves (e.g. one unit of a certain type is spawned when you tap on that type's icon). The goal could be to get to the other side, or to destroy a base on the other side or even destroy all towers.\n\nEDIT: The important part will be the balance. It should not be possible to finish the level (at least not higher levels) by simply repeatedly spawning the same unit. Timing and sequence should be important I.e. some units would have higher aggro index but be stronger, while others are weaker, but could destroy towers. So you time them in a way that the second unit arrives to the tower when the first one is distracting it etc.\n"
5hq8vg,TPS Cover based MMORPG?,"Howdy. I've been always interested in making games of all kinds, since my mind is always full of ideas I'll never be able to make. \n\nI already wrote a little story, but my txt file is already like three pages long on game mechanics idea that is not yet finished, cause I've a lot more of that. I've even made a little map to hype myself up more. Think; Tom Clancy's The division but only lots better.

5hpofd,Pod Racing For 3D Modellers,"So I've had this idea for awhile and I'm not sure if it actually works since I'm just a student and don't know much about coding and all those mumbo-jumbo. \nSo anyway I'll just throw it out there, think of the scene in Star Wars Ep. 1 when Anakin was a young padawan and races in the Pod Race. A deadly race to get to the finish line and eliminating others, with weapons or strategic teamwork, to increase your chances of winning. \nThat's the game, except, you model your own vehicles/pod racers/jet racers, with customized weapons. That way 3D modellers can at least enjoy / show off their craftsmanship and I think it would be just fun destroying others with your own ship. \nThe problem's are:\nCoding | not much for the map, but those who can code their own models to fly and do manoeuvres are lucky, those who don't, aren't lucky (find someone who can for a cheap price)\nAnimation | If your good at it you would not have any problem to rig your ship\nMap | Volunteers or people who would rather just watch the match in their deathly modeled maps are preferred to model the map\nRecognition | Not enough supports, and this idea will probably end up in the deep thread. \nBut I thank those who took their time to read this.

By ""realistic"", I mean that if I swing a longsword through my enemies' forearm I want to lop that bitches hand off like an unsightly branch on the tree in your front yard. Also, as you can imagine, that sense of power should translate to every weapon; axes, spears, bows, etc.\n\nWith the weapon-play in mind, I think being able to implement a leveling system and skill tree similar to a Path of Exile or Diablo 2 style would be a really nice complement. \n\nAlong with weapons and combat, you can't have a fantasy RPG that doesn't include magic. Remember the druids and necro's from diablo 2? Now picture their spells 21st century style. Giant flaming boulders, meteors the size of hatchbacks, bone walls from hell, mean ass golems etc.\n\nSome more ideas: big map, detailed graphics, local rendering to eliminate loading screens, local co-op play, gems and socketed weapon enchantments.\n\nBasically, I'm picturing a lovechild of dark souls and diablo/PoE. However, there's a lot of elements I have in mind from other big time RPG's like WoW and elder scrolls.\n\n I'm trying to leave the idea fairly vague but with enough detail to build on.

Things move, pop out, the corpse moves when you do not look, etc. But a large mechanic is the ghost will slowly tell you their story. As the story progresses the ghost becomes more violent and angry, until finally the story is finished. The story is finished when the ghost tells you how it died, and then you are killed in the same manner. So it will be a race against time, with puzzle solving and investigation in a horror atmosphere."

5hattm,Probably insane ideas of a game based on customization and creation,"I've been browsing a lot of games that promise extensive creation recently, only to deliver with minor reshaping tools of the same cookie-cutter character bases. Through this, I've come up with an idea. What if characters were made completely from scratch by the player, then placed in a world with preset physics? Not as in ""choose what you want"" but rather ""here, have some shapes, you make the pieces.""\n\nI understand how this could be flawed, but with proper implementation it may work. Limbs of a character could possibly be individual objects or parts, as if you were shaping your own LEGO piece. Hit boxes would be a problem, but if players are given full control with the proper tools, those dedicated enough could create wonderful characters and objects without needing to undergo extensive learning processes! \n\n...of course, most of this is just speculation, so it's probably a crazy idea."

5h2ywi,Heart and Brain - An Adventure Game,"Background: the most common inner conflictions revolve around the heart and brain disagreeing with each other. The brain works with pure logic, able to make sound predictions and solve computational / pattern-heavy problems, but is generally assumed to disregard morals and ethics in order to promote the truth and reality of a given situation. The brain is often thought of as a realist with hints of pessimism and doubt. The heart works with passion and courage, and can therefore make decisions that defy logic or endanger itself with the hope of success that may not even be attainable. The heart is often thought of as a pure optimist. The two balance each other out, and therefore have equally weighted pros and cons as individual entities.\n\n\nConcept: take the idea of the heart and brain as stated above, but personify them as physical entities. I imagine the ""brain"" character as a realistic-looking brain with arms, hands, legs, and feet, and maybe wearing a pair of glasses. I imagine the ""heart"" character as  the common heart shape you'd see in a cartoon (not realistic), also with arms, hands, legs, and feet. The point of the game would be to guide the ""heart"" and ""brain"" characters on some kind of personified/philosophical journey.\n\n\nGenre(s): Action-Adventure / Puzzle\n\n\nMechanics:\n\n* I imagine the game from a 3D third-person perspective, where the camera can orbit around the player (much like Assassin's Creed, for example).\n\n* You'd be able to switch between controlling the ""heart"" and ""brain"" characters (similar to GTA V). However, the characters must remain close together. Perhaps they'd need to maintain line-of-sight.\n\n* Jumping off of the previous point: here lies the potential for multiplayer. One player controls the ""heart"" while the other controls the ""brain.""\n\n* While both can walk/jog, sprint, and jump, the ""brain"" and ""heart"" possess different abilities.\n\n* The ""brain"" can retain knowledge, and so is the only one with access to their shared inventory. It holds all of the keys, maps, tools, etc, to guide them on their adventure. When they are in physical danger, the ""brain"" does not possess the ability to fight, but it can equip and un-equip the ""heart"" with weapons and shields they've picked up over the course of the game. The ""brain"" can also visualize how to solve puzzles, but may not have the physical endurance or strength to solve them (say, if a heavy box needed to be pushed across the room). I imagine while the player is in control of the ""brain,"" glowing holograms of correct solutions to puzzles would be available. Or something like that.\n\n* The ""heart"" can engage in physical combat, as noted above. However, the ""heart"" and ""brain"" share a one-way ""health bar"" relationship in that when the ""heart"" is damaged, the ""brain"" is also damaged, but when the ""brain"" is damaged directly, that damage is NOT passed down to the ""heart."" This encourages the ""brain"" to be conscious of protecting the ""heart"" while the ""heart"" can be free to fight for itself. This mechanic also highlights the pessimistic/realistic anxiety of the ""brain."" The ""heart"" can also interact more physically with the environment, as noted above. It can push, pull, lift, and throw objects, as well as climb and swim. When it climbs and swims, it will have to physically carry the weight of the ""brain."" A ""stamina"" bar (similar to Dark Souls) may be implemented for this.\n\n* More mechanics can be added. This is really just a shell of a concept in progress here.\n\n\nTwist: the ""heart"" and ""brain"" each see the world differently. The ""brain"" sees the world how it ACTUALLY is, with all its literal and figurative pit falls. This enables it to solve puzzles where the ""heart"" may not even see a puzzle at all, etc, etc. It may even be able to view the stats and ""health bars"" of enemies while the ""heart"" cannot. The ""heart"" sees the world through figurative (or, heck, maybe literal) rose-colored glasses. The world appears much more colorful with butterflies and rainbows galore. Enemies physically appear less intimidating, because the ""heart"" is suppose to have courage where the ""brain"" does not. Because the environment may also appear slightly different, the ""heart"" may actually discover whimsical/illogical solutions to problems where the ""brain"" could not visualize them. For instance, taking hold of a balloon to float to a higher area. Or something. I don't know.\n\n\n*deep breath*\n\nWhat do you all think?"

Inevitably, the two characters meet and have to work together… somehow.\n\nMaybe the cop catches the robber and takes him to jail, but the cop gets sentimental and frees the robber.\n\nThe gameplay would probably go like this: After the two characters meet up and become partners in crime, the robber commits illicit acts while the cop prevents the other cops from arresting the robber. The cop would secretly sabotage the other cops, preventing them from capturing the robber. You would, for example, rob a bank as the robber and later switch to the cop, where you have to hinder the other cops from arresting the robber by breaking their equipment, placing false leads, _etc._\n\nIn one situation, the robber would rob a store, and the cop would have to subtly hinder his coworkers catching up with the robber in a car chase. In other situations, the robber would rob a bank, and the cop would have to prevent the other cops from obtaining the location of the robber. Basically, the deal is that the cop is on the robber’s side but doesn’t want the other cops to figure that out, since then he’d be in trouble. Perhaps later in the game, the cops figure out the acts of our cop character, and he’s captured, so the robber would have to save the cop.\n\nWhen not in a mission, you can switch between the cop and the robber at free will in an open world with side missions (hopefully this game wouldn’t be _too_ similar to GTA 5).\n\nI’m certainly not a game developer, but I think a game like this would be amazing."

5grc33,Need help with my Game,"Hey, Guys, I know how bright you all are, and I need help. I am currently making a game about the player fighting and finding out why the earth has become super corrupt (In the Distant Future). It will be a 2d, pixel art game. But, I don't know what engine to use, and any idea to add to the story! Help!"
5iwwpw,Need help thinking of Smash/ Tower Fall esque game,I have a 2 week break and should keep up with my coding over the break and I thought designing/ making the mechanics for the game would be good. So I coded joust a while back and it was fun to play it against others and I wanted to make a game similar to it. Arena games are fun and easy to play locally and don't require extra skills because the screen is stationary etc. Any ideas for a game like Smash bros or TowerFall or Joust?

5iwgoa,Crazy idea for a cool game,Imagine an island with an abadoned resort...  Filled with loose dinosaurs. It would be something like Dayz and it could have a story mode.
5iwcio,Risk-like game with a Advance Wars style turn based battle system,"Alright, so this game would be similar to Risk, where you move armies around different sections of a large world map to capture as much territory as you can. The way this differs from Risk is in how the battle system works.\n\nInstead of just comparing the amount of armies the two sides have, and picking a winner, that area would enter a battle (possibly have small explosion graphics above it in the world map to signify it being under siege). The battle would play similar to Advance Wars, or Fire Emblem, where it is turn based, and will require actual battle tactics rather than just having a larger army count.\n\nYou'll be able to make armies in certain territories that allow you to do so, and they are what contain the troops that you send into battle. For example, you could make a few standard infantry armies and a tank army, and send them into battle together. When the turn based battle begins, you'd have all of the troops from the armies that entered.\n\nOverworld Map Example: https://m.imgur.com/gallery/ILmE0\nBattle Map Example: https://m.imgur.com/gallery/ybQOX\n\nIf a third team enters an active battle, they get placed into the battlefield, and can begin to fight.\n\nThis would be played online over a multiple day long game (most likely not in one sitting).\n\nLet me know what you think, and I'll try to answer any questions anyone asks.\n\nTL;DR: Risk but with the troop building and turn based battles of Advance Wars\n\nEDIT: Added examples of what the overworld and battle screens would look like"

5iv72z,"Game based on ""The Conversation""/Being a Private Investigator","For those who haven't seen The Conversation[1] , it's a fantastic movie based on a man (Gene Hackman) who bugs/and records people for a living, creating bleeding edge (for the 70's) high-tech means of recording the impossible.\nI envision a game, much like Hitman, where your job is to do the same. \n\nSometimes you have access to a place and have to decide where to hide the bugs, how to record, other times you're kept at a distance - will you use directional microphones/cameras, or will you plant bugs on people and hope they go where you need them to. All this must be done, of course without being caught, with useable results, and within time-limits.\n\nIf a 'persistent world' type of thing could be involved where you could also put bugs/trackers on random strangers etc. looking for scandal to sell/blackmail (increasing your revenue and reputation?) unless you get caught....\n\nPerhaps you need to bribe, or trade information, and this could easily be a community-based game, with a market for info, equipment plans, etc. If MMORPG or at least multiplayer, then there could be competition for contracts, attempts to discover and bug your opponents to steal their money/secrets/plans/taunt them. You'd have to watch out for tails, at least when on a mission or heading back to your secret lair of technological wonder.\n\nAnd of course, defenses and warning systems and escape routes would be a necessity for the chance your layer is raided by the cops. So there could be a construction/design component.\n\nThere could also be a computer component, but I've yet to play a computer hacking simulation that, well, was fun (to me).\n\nAll based on surveillance and avoidance.\n\nI'd love a spy game too, or a more 'realistic' GTA where it's not mayhem but real-world crime you mimic, but this is a bit different, combining the two with an emphasis not on the running and gunning, but on the planning and careful execution.\n\nAs in Hitman, there would be real world sounds to frustrate your efforts (music, toilets, air conditioners, video games, traffic, parades, etc.), security (who debug, search, and beat-down those they catch (or worse)); as well, there would be a huge range of solutions to each problem based more on acoustic and optical physics than pre-programmed possibilities.\n\nIt could be a P.I. game as well which could expand the options for play. And both, of course, allow you to play good, evil, or however you like, being open.\n'missions'/'commissions'/'hires' would be procedurally generated. I personally dream of a persistent world, of sorts, where the 10000 people in the city are tracked throughout their lives so that someone who caught you bugging them earlier sees you and blows a mission for you later in the game - because, all along, they've been a waiter at the restaurant you just happened to try and bug.\n"

5ikyig,A neon theme Beat 'Em Up game,"Basically, this is a beat 'em up while multiple playable characters, which each have a color theme. Said color would be very prominent in the design of that character. At high action points in the games, the lighting in the game will be darkened and the color of the playable character will become bright and neon."
5iiur1,Zombie FPS Shooter (But not in the way you except),"So, before you downvote me and call me a DAYZ clone, I need to make this clear. Instead of a survival game like Minecraft , where food and shelter are needed, this a an actual FPS, like COD, Battlefield, Overwatch, etc., but It has zombies as npcs. Think of like L4D, NMRIH, but you will have enemy players. Essentially, you have a standard fight with other players, but you also have another enemy, zombies. These are npcs which will attack any player. This is makes it more challenged, as not only you're surrounded by zombies, you will only have modern-day weapons and abilities which means no parkouring (like in COD), no special abilities or ""ults"" (like in Overwatch), and no unrealistic weaponry (like in COD Zombies). Its essentially CSGO with zombies and maybe less realistic bullet damage."
5ieile,Third person looter,"Basically a follow up or a better descriptor of my previous post. Imagine Dark Souls and Diablo hybrid, with a much greater level of action combat realism similar to that seen in Kingdom Come. Combat would definitely be the focus in this game, and would rely heavily on weapon and skill building. Of course, you couldn't have a looter game without it being an MMO, so that's a given as well."
5ib20t,Hotel Manager: A FTL/Prison Architect mashup,"Based on a friend's experiences in the hotel industry a few years back:\n\nBeen playing a fair bit of FTL and Prison Architect lately, and been thinking the top down management style of game could easily apply to operating a hotel.\n\nTypical gameplay:\n\nYou select your land, and start building. Foundation, walls, doors. You can receive grants and loans that guide you through constructing a basic functional hotel and nudge you to chosing ways to make money.\n\nAnd then comes in the FTL component. Each month you receive X gueststo your hotel, who give you a ranking once they leave dependant on the facilities. Consistently good hotels will start looking shinier and cleaner, while low ranking hotels start producing rats and cracked surfaces.\n\nHowever, on top of this, each period (not sure if it'd be seasonal or weekly based time periods) there's a 1 in 3 chance of a Special Guest.\n\nSpecial guests are a series of events like a hotel inspector, a rich tourist, royalty. People with very specific needs who can severely wreck your Hotel Score.\n\nUltimately this should lead to a few Fawlty Towers scenarios where you end up doing ridiculous stuff to pacify your guests.\n\nYou'd control all your staff, and each would have a set of skills, but can also be swapped between roles: it's not unreasonable in a panicked and chaotic hotel that's partially on fire that a manager be asked to do janitorial duties for a day or two. Or a cook to be assisted by the receptionist in a pinch.\n\nI'd keep it infinite like Prison Architect, but it's not improbable that a scenario mode where you try to get 5 star rating on your hotel with serious work or try to kill the rat population could work for a tutorial or mission mode in the final game.\n\nThis idea is way beyond my skills, but I can sort of imagine it.\n\nTo get around the Prison Architect single floor limitation, I'd say you'd have a button to switch between layers of your hotel, more like the Sims games do. This'd probably make fire propagation and infestations and pathfinding harder, I honestly wouldn't know, but would be nice to have a multi-storey Hilton-knockoff in-game."
5iawin,A really great game idea!!1!1!1!!!1!!,"Please make a hunter x hunter RPG game. I'm looking for one EVERYWHERE and I can't find one that is both good and not in Japanese. I'm pretty sure there are a lot of people looking for a HxH game like me too. I suggest though, that you do not follow the story of Gon, but instead turn it into a Elder Scroll-like game where you can customize your character. So basically the story is that a kid wants to become a hunter and stuff. Even if you make the game looking like pokemon from the gameboy color, it's still play. There might be legal issues tho. Sorry if I sound retarded I just woke up and my head hurts but yeah, a hxh game sounds cool. "

5i2t68,Agent Provocateur,"We have games that you are the hero or the villain, but what if you are someone who inspires others to be the hero or villain through persuasion?\n\nMy thought would be a type of management game, things like Football Manager or Riot - Civil Unrest, where you have agents to cause unrest in a situation or to encourage others to perform heroic deeds. With your results (and after effects) shown in a newsfeed style results screen for each level.\n\nNot so much a god game as a grand overseer game, where you send you agents out to do good or evil deeds based on outside requests (shady government types, protest groups, anon type groups etc) who would then pay you for your deeds. \n\nMoney earned can be used to buy favour (power) or hire more agents to do more missions. \n\nEach level would have the option of having both good or evil 'job' offerings and result in a different result based on your actions (think chaos rating in something like Dishonoured where the rat plague gets worse with more bodies)\n\nThe game would play as management game, could be something as simple as a Uplink style computer interface with news streaming on a video link, or even security camera/wearable camera feed for more up close and personal viewing. (and depending on the amount of work someone wants to code for)\n\nAs you progress through the game you generate power and control but also become more aware to the authorities and opposing groups (for negative deeds, resulting in a challenge of gaining enough power to manipulate those after you (say by controlling the media releases of your actions) or doing good deeds to reduce your heat level (and still piss off other groups that disagree with you).\n\nWould be a single player game, though the possibility of multiplayer might work if you had other players in other agencies competing with you to gain power.\n"

You can use them at any way you like, as long as you can make them happen!\n\n- A boss which, similar to Mr. Freeze in Arkham City, can only be attacked with one method per attack. Any further attacks with the same method would be ignored. This could be used in many ways, eg the player can use headshot on the boss once, then the headshot would not work anymore.\n\n- A boss which constantly taunts the player (not the character) during the course of battle. This can include inverting controls repeatedly (to make life hell for the player), changing controls many times, throwing crosshairs all over the HUD (makes it confusing), calling the player a ""cheater"" when using x-ray vision, etc. Yes, basically Psycho Mantis.\n\n- A boss which is, basically, the level itself. Similar to the Master Core, the boss's health could be decreased by hurting boss-controlled spawns while avoiding environmental attacks from the boss, eg fighting spiders in a possessed cave while avoiding lighting storms in the cave.\n\n- A boss which requires changing the date/time to weaken the boss. Eg, at current time, the boss would be nigh-invincible, but move the date two weeks, and attacks on the boss would hurt him!\n\n- A boss which hunts the player down, and when the player is spotted, the boss vanishes; once the player turns around, the boss appears and jumpscare-hurt the player.\n\n- A madness-in-our-mind boss battle, where the level is a maze, and the player must find the exit while fighting constant taunts, attacks, etc.\n\n- A boss which its health is linked to the player, and the only way to defeat the boss is to get hurt yourself.\n\n- A boss which cannot be defeated, unless HUD is turned off.\n\nHey, even share your ideas, critique, etc in the comments! That should be fun!"

5jgabo,"An open world war game that will never be made, it's abstract","So as many of you probably know or don't know, there is a lack of modern open world war games, however few can come up to par of my upcoming idea you'll listen to, such as Planetside 2, but you've not come here to listen about games, no you've come to listen to an idea that will no doubt be taken into consideration by any major game creation company. So you may be asking yourself, ""why did you decide to post this?"" Well I like posting out abstract ideas and what not relating to different topics, but enough of that and let's just jump into this game plot idea.\n\nSo, to start off this game will never be accomplishable up to the standards that are mentioned here. Anyways, the game revolves around a huge war on a planet that features technology and what not similar to earth, but a bit more advanced. You'll see various energy weapons, similar to those in the fallout games series (btw I love fallout games) such as laser rifles, tesla cannons etc as well as some prototype weapons and some unique to any game. But anyways, the game revolves around a big war right? Yes, and this big war comes into terms of 4 army's that you, the player can designate in to. Each army however, has moral and diplomatic pros and cons, and each has a different goal. You'll have a crumbling and corrupt government, which however has now been taken into hands of a bright leadership. A newly formed order, which deems to neutralise all life and presence of areas in order to retain crime, and bring in peace and leadership. You then have the rebels, which ain't the stereotypical good guys, but are more to that of a vicious militia which aims to ""free the people from corruption and forced rule"", and finally you have a massive force, which wishes to just destroy all 3 other armies, in order to create a land of freedom and democracy. Yes, sure they all seem a bit shabby and maybe stereotypical, but I think you should have some time to choose. Anyways, each army you can choose will have extreme differences to each other, in terms of weaponry, vehicular use and ultimately battle tactics. \n\nThe game will feature battles in air, sea land, and can range from 10 players to even 1000s, yes, this will be impossible but this is just a concept. Combat as a whole will be ruthless, extremely violent but also highly realistic, in terms of damage and tactics. This ain't just some call of duty, you won't be running in guns blazing, you'll need to take cover, utilise cover and peek around corners in order to gain your kills. Each weapon will have different aspects, laser weapons will be extremely fast in terms of reach speed, however, the damage is fairly low and it will not interfere with the environment. Then you have your plasma, electric and force and magnetic, you get the point and you can tell. Ballistic weapons however will be your main source of fire arms, but energy will also be your optional, each type of weapon will have pros and cons but I can't be bothered to explain for a puny post in a Reddit page. Everything can be customised in terms of weapons, armour and vehicles to your liking and strategy.\n\nThere will be few servers, as this game is designed for 10s of thousands for each server. The way of playing the game is in taking over of teritories, which will then be available for spawning, fortification and strategic planning. Taking over an industrialised area will allow for more fuel, which can lead for more vehicle spawn, whilst taking over a city like area can open for extreme fortification, and for mass spawns. Each army will need to dominate the map in terms of taking over territory. That's it, a dumb idea which will never be made, but I hope you enjoyed the idea and actually took the time to read it. Leave comments if you wish, I'll read them.\n\nEdit: So I know this is a long post, and many won't be bothered to read, but like I said, I like to share ideas. The main gameplay will be highly realistic, jets will need to be started up, and they will function in terms of speed, agility and weapon standards to those in real life. Vehicles also have extremely useful roles and skills, depending on if the player utilising the vehicle is skilled enough. You can't just be an amazing sniper and the best pilot ever in this game, no. You will need to be designated to a certain role, and mastering a role can take months and even years. Jets can carry out heavy bombing, and can divert enemies allowing huge strikes and vehicles to enter, and dogfights will be highly realistic. Even though this is a puny idea, the sound of this game will be my main focus. The sound will be ultra realistic, so if you see a jet flying over you, you'll believe it to be a real one.\n\nBattles can last up to days (in real life) and there will also be natural disasters and weather impacts, so if a storm comes into place, air vehicles cannot take part into battle. The game will be split into 9 major districts.\n:A massive city\n:Edge of the city\n:Massive forest\n:Desert\n:Industrial area\n:Testing grounds (remnants of the governments inhumane bombing area)\n:Volcano (Main HQ for the order, to make them seem a bit evil) \n:Acid fields\n:And finally the mountains \n\nThese districts are extremely massive, and these districts hold sectors which must be taken over. All sectors of a district must be taken over for total control of a faction, however, massive weather affects can halt and impact control, such as floods, tornadoes etc and even volcanic eruptions. Destruction will be groundbreaking in this idea, and everything can be destroyed to flush out enemies, or just for your destructive nature. The game will mainly be first person, but this isn't your typical call of duty, you aren't just fixed to your gun, your head is actually moveable, and you can see your legs, shadows etc. This will be a key for survival, as you need to actually use your brain and try to find out which posture for taking cover will mean living or being shot. \n\nArmour in the game can range from your standard patrol armour, to power armour (yes I know, fallout idea) to even radioactive clothing, for exploring certain areas. Each server however, will come to and end and the whole server will be reset after one faction wins. When a faction dies, the players will have to migrate to another, which will soon lead to a 1v1 in factions, which will turn to be the biggest battle in online history, since each player will migrate. Let's put this into a simple term.\n\nSay there is 2000 players in each faction, meaning a total of 8000 players, since there is 4 factions, once 2 factions have been destroyed, there will be 4000 in each. This can lead to focused battles, and prolonged war without the worry of a surprise attack from lets say an unwelcome army which can turn the tide of battle. \n\nNow you may be wondering if you actually cared to listen to this useless post, how do you take down factions? Well each faction is stationed at the corner of the map, and to get to that corner is no easy task. Each faction is armed to the teeth, and to take down a faction, you must take over the districts surrounding the faction HQ, and you must then absolutely anhilate their base. Once a faction HQ battle comes into place, each player for that faction will only be given a limited number of spawns , in and out of that faction. If the defenders succeed in keeping the attackers out, that faction will survive. Once 1 faction wins, you'll be given your ending slideshow of what that faction will accomplish from their morals and ideas, to how they did in battle. After that, the server will reset, and every player will keep what they have unlocked, their level etc and the whole war will start again. \n\nYou thought I was finished? Wrong, as mad and insane this idea sounds, there will be a deep melee feel to the game, and you can use swords etc and stuff like that if you run out of ammo (which you will) \n\nDeaths will also be very gruesome, and it will be all in first person. Let's say the volcano erupts, and a massive lake of lava forms, if you fall into that lava you won't just set on fire and die, no, you'll sink in slowly half way and you'll burn and visually melt in front of players and you'll start screaming. There will be a gore body damage system in the game aswell, and limbs and evened parts of limbs can be shot, torn or blown off."

5jb5v6,VR game about building logic circuits,"This would essentially be a VR sandbox game where you are in a relaxing environment and have access to gates, wire connections, display lights, etc. and you build cool logical creations.\n\nThe logic system would be something akin to redstone from Minecraft, but would not be restrained by the limitations of wires connecting when you don't want them to, as you would just connect wires yourself where you want them to be connected, or having to work around the other parts of the circuit, as the parts would be able to pass through one another without interacting (unless you connect them, of course).\n\nThere would be several methods of input for the circuit, and with the right tools, people could make a share some really amazing things. Again, look at the Minecraft redstone community.\n\nLet me know what you think of the idea!"

5j9z0o,Drug wars open world game,"So here's more or less the thing: I love the drug wars style of games. Some versions are better than other. I'd like to make a **realistic** version of that game in an open world style. Realistic here I mean it in drug dollars, infrastructure, usual problems and so on.\n\nI lean towards some kind of Prison Architect 2Dish style that would imitate a real town (think GTA flattened): some zones are good to buy coke, other to sell weed, others cop infested...\nOne big part of it, to try and keep it realistic, is that you can adopt any link in the chain of the drug industry:\n\n1. raw materials\n1. production\n1. shipping\n1. maybe cut the product\n1. prepare distribution\n1. footman sell\n1. collect revenues\n1. Launder money?\n1. Reinvest. Buy more warehouses, manpower, snitches, army. Get better contracts, bigger transports.\n\nWhere it gets more out of hand I guess is that I imagine you picking any link in that chain. You want to take care of the marihuana plants when you're starting and maybe buy bigger real estate to increase your plantation and find more and bigger buyers? So be it. But different drugs require different raw materials, trade routes, process, timings, expenses, clients... I don't want to get stuck with only one drug but at the same time I don't know how to make it work with the real variety there is and spreading myself (or team, **I will put money if the thing is sound**) too thin.\n\nI'm experienced in all kinds of development through the years, regarding this matter backend development, mostly MAMP and lately MEAN stack. I'd love to develop this game in JS back and front. I've seen great frameworks, but for now technology is out of my concern. I just like javascript a lot and it seems it can deal with multiplatform well.\n\nThis may be my biggest project to date so I want to go step by step, I'm not in a hurry. Maybe engaging the right people and ideas first and see from there."
5j883r,[Request] Ideas for local multiplayer (2-4 players) game,Hello! I've been programming for quite some time and want to finally make a finished product. The hardest part of this is proving to be a good idea for a game... If you have an idea for a local multiplayer game I'd love to hear it!
5j5gnv,"you've died, but you have to rebuild your being and return to your universe to save someone","Here's a concept for a game that I wish existed.\n\nYou've died, and you find yourself in the ""recreation realm,"" only able to see in greyscale, and with no personality, memories, feelings... You're a human soul in a superficial body. You discover, through some helpful exposition from the goddess of creation, that humans are ""erased"" once they die, and they have new beings, lives, personalities, etc., made for them, then they're born into a new universe (multiple universe + multiple lives theories oooh). However, the goddess holds some people from heading to new universes because their prior universe still needs them. \n\nYou are given a memory of your daughter, which, in turn, gives you your motherly instinct and love. You remember the blue eyes of your daughter and start to see the color blue all around you.\n\nYou're informed that your daughter is in great danger, and that you must rebuild your being and return to your universe to save her. Bits and pieces of your memory, personality, feelings, and color are spread throughout the recreation realm, and you must find them to build enough of a human to return to your universe.\n\nMemories are quick-time sections. When a memory is found (whether it's hidden somewhere, dropped by a boss, or needed for plot), you live that memory. The outcome of a memory affects certain things in the recreation realm, like boss battles, enemies in a certain area, friendly human encounters, spawning of collectibles, etc. The better a memory is executed, the better/easier things are in the recreation realm. They also have a butterfly effect that causes changes in other memories.\n\nEverything starts in black and white except the goddess of creation. Colors (what colors you can see in) are gained through memories (all plot-based memories, ie. required memories). They're unlocked through seeing a colorful something of importance in a memory, like the blue eyes of the daughter, the red color of blood, the bright yellow of the sun, etc. A cutscene would show the shift into seeing things of that new color.\n\nThe game would have multiple endings depending on:\n-how many memories, feelings, and traits are collected\n-how your memories play out (ie. how perfectly you executed the quick-time events)\n\nfor a lot more, but a lot messier, here's a link to the full plot idea: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RN83PIZezwMfZyhphWwJgA5olb2UNtJESlHgZiEIDeg/edit?usp=sharing\n\nlet me know your thoughts and feedback. I think this could make a neat comic or novel as well, so if anybody wants to use the concept for anything, just let me know."
5j5efj,A new take on the survival genre (as far as I know),"We've seen them all haven't we? From Minecraft to Rust and everything in between. It's always the same premise; start with nothing, potentially end up with everything.\n\nThis game would be a huge undertaking that I can't fully express here, seeing as i don't want this to drag on too long.\n\nIt would be set anywhere based around tectonic plate boundaries and, in just stating that basic idea, you've probably guessed where this is going. \n\nYou're walking down the street with a wide-range of optional starts- e.g. as a police officer or a businessman or fitness enthusiast, or even a criminal. A tsunami warning blares and you've got to go.\n\nEach start affords you possibilities- where you can go, what you can get npcs to do, starting weapons etc, money in your pocket and then you try to live through Mother Nature's wrath. You think you're safe from a tsunami on a hill, but when the ground cracks and breaks open and suddenly you're caught in a landslide... not so safe after all. \n\nThere will be all possible options; from picking up a simple piece of broken glass to kill another human (npc or player if m'player) to boarding up the windows of a house you've broken into to outlive a tornado. \n\nThe world would have to be huge, or at least you can choose the city where you start and break it up into 'instances'. The graphical quality would be medium- a low-res Skyrim. \n\nAny thoughts, feedback? This is my first idea, hope someone enjoyed reading.\n\n[edit] I have no idea what to Flair this as, so apologies. Experienced onwards would be my guess, but I have no idea."

5j2h3g,Toribash inspired fighting game,"Years ago I played Toribash, it's a fighting game where you stretch or contract the joints of your character during a set time, the game then moves your character depending on how you set the joints.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0l9NVcPlDY\n\nWhile it was a good idea it did have some problems.\n\n1. Fights didn't look realistic, it mostly just looked like 2 flailing bodies trying to hit eachother.\n2. The characters looked more like crash test dummies and the maps were just empty rooms\n3. While the game had a whole list of modes it all felt a bit flat, weapons weren't really interesting leading to one mode being played most of the time.\n4. The game was multiplayer only.\n\nWith all these flaws I did like the core idea behind it, with some additions and fixes a new game with the same concept could be awesome if done right.\n\n**The basic idea:**\nSo you have your screen, on the bottom you have a timeline divided in head, arms, torso and legs. To the left you have menus for the same parts + a way to record and use your own moves. The rest of the screen is a view of your character with different **camera modes** such as:\n\n**Normal camera:** Where the camera just shows your character from a third person.\n\n**Joints camera:**  Where the camera shows your character's joint points that you can manipulate, similar to how Toribash looks.\n\n**Triple camera:** top, side, normal view for extra precision.\n\nIn the menus you find preset animations like:\n\n**Head:** look up, look down, a whole list of facial expressions\n\n**Arms:** Punch, block, grab\n\n**Torso:** Twist, bend over, bend backwards\n\n**Legs:** Kick, Go to, Jump, Runjump, get up (when on the ground)\n\nAll those presets give you the option of amount (angle) and speed, for attack moves you have to select a destination or target. You can also edit the movements after you select them. \n\n**AutoBalance**: There should be an option where your character will try to keep his balance with his legs when you make him move around. If an action will make him unable to keep his balance you'll get a warning to either turn the auto balance off or not do that particular move.\n\nYou can also select a part of your character's body and move to the position you want it to be with different camera angles helping you to be precise. Once you're happy with it it shows you a ghost movement in 2 ways, green is the movement and red is how much it needs to slow down again. Depending on the speed you want certain movements take longer to slow down.\n\nOn the **timeline** you see what part moves in what time and how long it takes. In principle you can make one long list of moves but since the timeline only affects your character and not the enemies this wouldn't be very smart.\n\nIf you're happy with your current list of moves you **press and hold space to let the time run whatever speed you want**, at least in single-player.\n\n**Single-player:** It could be a set of challenges like being surrounded by X amount of enemies, survive for X amount of minutes, fight in a hallway like Oldboy, Kill X amount of enemies. You could even have a level where you have to do a silly walk.\n\n**Enemies** will either be unarmed or have swords, pistols or sub-machine guns. When an enemy targets you with a weapon you'll see a red line that represents the trajectory of a potential bullet. Green line means the enemy is just targeting you, a red line means the gun is fired and a bullet is on its way. Since you can pause time whenever you want it should be possible to dodge bullets.\n\n**Weapons** should be quite common in the game like swords, pistols and sub-machine guns but with limited ammo. If you've seen Wanted the final fight scene should at least be partially possible in the game.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37KddyjUxnQ\n\n**Graphics** shouldn't be state of the art hyper-realistic but it should at least represent actual humans. Physics should at least be fairly realistic, not low grav like in Toribash, wit the Autobalance it should be doable."

5kzmov,[Dream] A biofeedback horror game that learns and evolves,"A biofeedback horror game is a game that reads a heart monitor attached to the player, and adjusts itself accordingly.\n\nWhat if there was a game that could learn what scares you the most? It starts by showing you random things. Every time it shows you something, it reads the monitor to see how you reacted. By 'tagging' certain kinds of things, it counts the positive reactions you've had and eventually settles on what you react to the most.\n\nDo you react more to being chased or watched? Are humanoids scarier, or animals? What about the amount of features it has; something detailed, or something blank like a mannequin? Maybe character suits or animatronics? Is it scarier to see it move or for it to freeze when you look at it? Speaking of moving, what about footsteps vs a wet slithering? Do you react more when it gets dark, or when it gets bright and your ears start ringing? I could go on and on...\n\nI think it'd also be interesting if you could look at the results and see what it learned you were afraid of, AND it could upload those results and show what the most people are afraid of."
5kzann,Teddy the Nightmare Fighter - Play as a teddy bear who defends a sleeping child from monsters at night.,"**Name:** Teddy the Nightmare Fighter\n\n**Concept Overview:**\n\n* Based off of [this picture](http://img04.deviantart.net/61bc/i/2006/302/1/7/sweet_halloween_dreams___p_by_begemott.jpg) that you have all seen.\n* There is something just so *overwhelmingly* comforting about the idea of teddy bears defending you from monsters at night. This game is meant to encapsulate that feeling.\n\n**Plot:**\n\nYou are the average teddy bear. Thus, you are all that stands between your human's vulnerable sleeping body and the hordes of demons that swim about in his nightmares. Armed with nothing but a teddy-sized wooden sword and shield, you decimate anything that stands in the way of your human's beauty sleep.\n\n**Setting:**\n\nSimply enough, the average child's bedroom. \n\n**Characters:**\n\n* Teddy\n * It is in your nature, unknown and unexplained, to provide the ultimate comfort to a sleeping child. \n* Child\n * They sleep, and everything else about them is unimportant and irrelevant.\n* Monsters\n * They are able to interrupt your human's sleep, an evil above every other.\n\n**Gameplay Mechanics:**\n\n* May take some inspiration from Shadow of the Colossus.\n * Simple concept of the game.\n * Very small and underequipped versus extremely large.\n * You might have to climb up the monsters in order to properly stab them.\n* You don't sleep so you are invulnerable to the monsters ""nightmares"". However, you are not invulnerable to their ""aura of the unknown"" or their inhumane nature.\n * Everything about them in your perception is extremely warped, as they are the manifestation of a nightmare. The word for this is ""phantasmagoric"". \n * If a monster attacks your human too much then your human wakes up, and you lose respect in their eyes.\n * If a monster attacks you then you might drop your equipment or experience some psychadelic effects.\n\n**Standout Features:**\n\n* The visuals of the monsters are to be like that in no other game before.\n* Fulfills an instintual desire to protect children. \n* Extreme focus on enemy variety. \n* The tone of the game is very serious and dark, but the concept is naturally quite bizarre and hilarious. I mean, you're a god damn tiny Teddy bear with a couple small weapons fighting Godzilla and King Kong's baby while high on psychadelics. \n\n**Possible Platforms:**\n\n* Any platform, really.\n\n**Extra Features:**\n\n* Procedurally generated asymmetrical enemies.\n * Take various everyday fears, give them visuals and abilities, and then put them into a stack to mash together with others.\n * Enemy themes change as your human ages. May become slightly more Silent Hill-esque as your human hits puberty and starts thinking about boobs.\n * Feeling of variety and obscurity is further increased by the random warping of enemies' visuals. Parts of their body may even be replaced mid-fight (your dreams can get off track and become inconsistent quite easily). Maybe they'll gain or lose a finger. Maybe they'll gain or lose 20% of their size.\n* A rewarding, badass-feeling-inducing, and consistently fun combat system.\n * Most likely motion based.\n * Speed of combat warps at times, for occasional slow-motion or fast-motion. Difficulty of combat changes along with it.\n * Perhaps like the combat of Overgrowth, where the type of attack you use is context-sensitive based on your distance from an enemy and your stance.\n * For fun and adding hilarity at the stupidity of the situation, perhaps Teddy can have the ability to run on and jump off walls. \n\n**How To Credit Me:**\n\nAll the real credit goes to Alex Panagopoulos, the creator of the drawing that inspired me to make this post. Perhaps he or someone else he inspired could do the art for such a game. "
5kz0m5,"Combat Aircraft: Create, Test, Fly Missions","**[BACKGROUND]**\n\nThe indie game market has been fairly saturated with sandbox build-a-vehicle-then-drive/fly/pilot-it games for a few years now. Most of them are fairly unstructured sandbox experiences with decent in-game creation tools, some kind of active simulation of whatever you build, and perhaps some milestone goals for your vehicles (SimplePlanes). Some of these games get quite deep in their creation tools and simulation of combat (From The Depths), or focus on survival or multiplayer (Space Engineers). But what a lot of these games ultimately focus on is creation. You don't have to go far to see what ridiculous shit people build in these games, oftentimes, when you've gotten bored building random things, you download other peoples creations to mess around for a while before putting the game to rest for weeks, months, or years.\n\nI think the problem with a lot of these games is they're missing a core gameplay loop, scenarios that challenge your foresight and piloting skills, and a sense of progression or a campaign. You know, the actual *game* part of equation. People can spend several hours creating their vehicles, imagining some sort of in-game scenario in which they would be useful, but many of these games poorly entertain that idea or do it in a very half-assed manner. The only game I can think of that comes close is Kerbal Space Program's career mode - it has defined objectives, money and tech to manage, an intuitively simple but *deep* vehicle editor, missions that come to life with exciting simulation gameplay, and goals that require functional, oftentimes rigorous vehicle builds and planning. It's tremendously satisfying when you land a craft on the moon and back to Earth - knowing you've built all the stages of the rocket which took you there, all the parts of the landing craft which, which took very careful planning of all stages of the mission and of course, the thrill of the moment-to-moment execution once you're in the simulation.\n\nI'd like to propose a vehicle-creation game with an actual, very refined *game* element - containing the same kind of thrills and uses all the different regions of your brain like KSP does, (though technically simpler in scope i.e. not modelling a seamless entire solar system+planets and accompanying orbital physics) and drawing on something more people probably find more intrinsically rewarding: combat. My game would be a combat flight simulator where you build the planes, test them, then fly them in challenging combat-oriented missions with specific objectives, and are rewarded with more money for better plane parts/weapons, or more tech for more advanced parts and technologies, or both - while the difficulty of the missions increase as you play through it. These missions would be part of a larger campaign which you progress through - more details on that in a bit. It would be a single player title, and opponents would be AI-controlled.\n\n**[OVERVIEW]**\n\nSo we start out with the fundamental gameplay element of the game - flying a warplane and scoring kills. If you're on a fighter mission, that means scoring aerial kills against rival aircraft in a dogfight. If you're on a bombing mission, it means surviving long enough to score kills against ground targets by accurately delivering bombs. Later on in the game as more tech is accrued, many more mission types come into play, and the roles start to blur together, just as they did with our own history of air combat. Your success as a pilot on these missions depends largely on two things - the design of your aircraft, and your skill on flying it on the battlefield.\n\nThat last point about the history of air combat is important - this game will take you through the history of air combat in a natural way - as a means of progression for the player in handling more complicated missions while managing more systems and different tactics as the aircraft improve technologically. So at the beginning of the game, you're making very simple fighters out of a handful of parts: fixed landing gear, slow prop engines, .40 caliber machine guns, cloth exteriors. WWI planes essentially. No bombers. The missions are dogfights employing those same kind of tactics, e.g. slower velocities, lower altitudes, get-behind-the-enemy and shoot until a wing snaps off or a fuel tank is penetrated and they go down. \n\nAfter a certain amount of those missions, and working on perfecting your designs, better parts come into play. Retractable landing gear, metal exteriors, 50 caliber guns. Anti Aircraft Fire is heavier and more ruthless. Bombers are introduced, along with a slew of bombs of different weights you can mount under the wings or in bays. Missions are more complex, as a fighter you're now escorting squadrons of bombers you designed, the bombers could have turret bays for their own defense. They could be heavy or light. They have to hit their targets accurately. Dogfights are faster and the planes are much more powerful and maneuverable. As you progress past this period, the propeller gives way to the jet engine, the machine guns become primitive IR or Radar guided missiles, then more advanced ones after that, the bombs become laser-guided or precision munitions or cluster bombs, countermeasures like chaff and flare are introduced, dogfights become BVR, SAM's come into play, stealth, autopilot, vectored thrust engines, strike missions, etc. The player progression and evolution of the gameplay is all there, written in our own history of flight.\n\n**[GAMEPLAY DESCRIPTION]**\n\nSo this is how the game is structured as a whole: you first select a country/faction out of a pool of 5 or so at the beginning of the game. This is really only a difficulty setting and aesthetic choice in disguise. The easiest country would have the most money available and most Procurement(s) available. The hardest would have little money, and few Procurement(s). You choose one and begin the game. Your country is at war with another and, as the director of the Air Force (and coincidentally a pilot) you must build planes and fly them on missions against the rival country. The creation aspect of the game would be called **Procurement**, and it is important as as the grand strategy element of the game. During Procurement, your country asks for a plane that can do certain things/meet certain goals. The first Procurement would be very simple: build a plane that can fly and shoot at other planes. Every Procurement consists of three phases. \n\n* So Phase 1a begins: you build the plane from the ground up. Once you are happy with your design, you move into Phase 1b, a test phase where you see how the aircraft performs purely in flight with no distractions. You take notes on what seems to work and what doesn't. \n* Once that is concluded, it goes back to the editor for Phase 2a: finalizing the airframe. You are able to make any major modifications to your initial airframe to correct any unforeseen problems in flight during 1b. This is also the phase where you place weapons or bombs on your aircraft. After your changes, Phase 2b begins, and it's now testing the aircraft with its weapon systems against dummy targets and bombing ranges. \n* The final phase is Phase 3. You go back to the editor, and you are only able to make very slight changes to your airframe, and general changes to your weapons systems and gizmos... And that's it, your design is finalized. Procurement is over. You've made your country's aircraft within a certain budget, and you wont be able to change the design until you fly several missions with it, proving its success or failure, forcing you to learn its strengths and weaknesses.\n\nProcurement is limited for several reasons - one, it encourages investment in making the best plane you can make from the onset. Two, it gives players time to really get to know the planes they designed and how they perform during missions, imprinting all the great things about the design as well as all the bad. Three, it provides challenge and rewards foresight. If you can redesign your plane after every mission, not only does that go against real world economics but the game becomes more about engineering than it does flying. Four, it mirrors the way planes are developed in real life. They are designed, flown, then they see service for a period of time. Any changes made after are minor and come after at least months to years of service. Completely new plane designs are expensive, and only happen seldomly as technology improves. Like I mentioned before, newbies can choose a more forgiving country that offers more procurement opportunities if they are struggling with creating successful planes. Veteran players can be given the challenge of receiving less. There can be two or three or four Procurements at once for different plane types. An example being your faction asks for an air-superiority focused fighter, a strategic heavy bomber, a stealthy light bomber, a ground attack plane, or a multi-role jack-of-all-trades fighter jet (insert F-35 joke here). These aircraft would all have missions that could involve each other, meaning you could fly a strike mission as a bomber you procured while you see your procured fighters (AI controlled) swatting off incoming bogeys for you. \n\nWhat would a mission look like? Let's use an example of a mission fairly late into the campaign, when the technology level resembles the 70s or 80s, i.e. when the majority of modern-day fighter planes were created. The mission at hand is a strike on a high-value bridge, a vital supply line for the enemy. It's guarded by 5 medium range SAM installations, and an enemy airfield a few miles away capable of scrambling fighters in minutes. You have procured an aircraft worthy of doing the job on its own - a fast, well-armed strike fighter/bomber. You pilot one of these, and get 2 squadmates (read: lives) to carry out the mission together. You mount weapons of choice for the aircraft: 2 500lb dumb bombs, and 2 med-range and 2 short-range air to air missiles in case things get hairy. The mission begins on a nearby friendly runway. Throttle up, pick up speed, liftoff, gear up. Your squad waits in the air. They enter formation, then you all head to the objective. After a certain distance, you drop altitude to under 100ft for ingress, avoiding detection on enemy radar. Your own ship radar (not a very good one, you spent more money on better engines) reads empty skies. 4 miles from the objective you execute a pop-up attack - you pull up to 500ft in seconds, locate the target, and dive bomb it. After bombs away, you pull to the right. The element of surprise worked, the SAMs need crucial time to power on and swivel to lock on to you. You take this time to bug the fuck out. However, your shitty radar did not detect two bogeys patrolling nearby, revealed to be enemy fighters, good ones too. Trying not to shit bricks, you full power out of there, but they're faster and they're already in range. They lock you up, and you get visual of missiles on your six. You release countermeasures and maneuver but a missile catches your wing and the craft is done. Upon your death, you immediately take control of a squadmates jet, also trying to leave, but still in range of the fighters. You have no choice but to engage. You swivel around and try to get a lock, and engage in a hairy dogfight. Through skill and luck, you manage to knock both enemy fighters out, but lose your strike jet and only have one, badly damaged strike jet left. It practically limps back to the friendly airfield, losing fuel, operating on hydraulics, but it still works, and you thank yourself for using better armor for the strike jets instead of curbing it for some other advantage. It's almost impossible, but you manage to touch down softly on the runway after the mission, getting a huge monetary bonus for it. And that's mission success. Onto the next one.\n\nSo there are the core systems. You have (1) an aircraft editor capable of utilizing various parts to dynamically build a realistic, powered aircraft with weapon systems (great existing example of a simple yet robust editor WITH some pretty great weapons available already is the game SimplePlanes, currently 7 dollars on steam). You have (2) the simulation in which your aircraft is player-controlled using a standard 3-axis control system, and subject to a flight model that gives it appropriate flying characteristics based on your design. The simulation would also have to include AI planes that fly your designs, utilizing identical flying characteristics, as well as basic ground units like buildings, anti-aircraft and SAM sites, etc. (SimplePlanes does these things as well). And (3), you would have the career progression structure, which includes a large variety of missions with steadily increasing difficulty, scale, and complexity, testing various classes of aircraft you build, with money and technology points rewarded upon mission success and landing, management of funds to primarily build airplanes but could also be used to give specific bonuses to your Air Force or increase your tech, and you fly all the way through the history of flight, with the planes you design, to achieve victory! Perhaps instead of one large war with 80 missions, your missions could be broken into several wars which you can 'lose' (failing a certain threshold of missions) or 'win' (succeeding beyond a threshold of missions) to provide finality for several of the conflicts and maybe have you fight different countries with different planes and strategies throughout the course of the game.\n\nAnyways, that's it. Had to write it down, mostly for myself to remember. Very long, yes, but goddamn I would give thousands of dollars of my own money to make this game a reality. I play a fair amount of flight sims, sandbox games, and combat flight sims like DCS and IL2, and while both are great, I think the ultimate experience would be having plane creation be an important part of a combat flight game.

It could take place in a fallout like setting where there are several factions or gangs that control different areas of the map.  The game can take place in first person or third person.  \n\nThe main character starts the game off like any fallout game.  He or she can visit the world and experience the different factions.  Eventually the character joins the faction and takes over becoming boss.  The goal of the game would be to take over the map.  \n\nThe game would be mostly management.  Every faction has pros and cons.  For instance a city gang could be fighting with another gang for control of the city and there is a lot of warefare.  A faction of farmers may not have the man power or firearms to prevent raiders from attacking.  The goal would be for the faction leader to recruit npcs, make money through farming, protection, stealing, drugs, firearm dealing, or other more honest means.\n\nThe faction leader can make alliances with other factions, doublecross them, and even send double agents to report on their actions.  If the game takes place in first person, the faction leader can go on custom missions to attack areas owned by factions or to rob stores/banks at the risk of dying but earning gang member respect.  \n\nI imagine for an added layer of complexity the fallout world could have a police force/faction and a system of laws and politicians.  \n\nif anything similar to this exists let me know, i would love to play it."
5kv1lf,"An MMO idea (Don't worry, it's just 2 mechanics)","Specifically, it could even be 2D with bare-bones graphics, because it's all about 2 major mechanics. (Though any MMO will requisite having a decently hefty amount of server power.)  \n  \nThough this is a long reading, to prove the ideas are quite simple I'll give the tl;dr here:  \n""...the player being able to customize their own AI.""  \n""...the player's character will only be able to do one task at a time, limiting their power...""  \n""a treaty-based diplomacy system [where] the players make their own treaties with other players, and all the game has to do is store the information and do what the treaty/contract says.""  \n  \nThe rest of my babble is just saying what I mean by these things.  \n  \nThere is one mechanic in the game Crusader Kings II that I haven't noticed in other games, and I've never heard of in an MMO. In CKII, you can, and, to an extent, must, give land you control to other characters, usually who are NPCs. If you don't, you may go over your soft-capped demesne limit, which makes your ruling inefficient, and almost always is a disadvantage. However, this also means that some other character controls something that you own, so they might decide to do something you don't like with your stuff.  \n  \nSomething like this is perhaps implementable with a combination of two large mechanics. The first of which is sort of just a bump to the idea of macros, the old thing from Dwarf Fortress.  \n  \nThis first mechanic would basically be the player being able to customize their own AI. They would set all the conditions and inputs and outputs, perhaps name some extra variables (but not too many). The AI should be able to do anything the player could hypothetically do. (To prevent the obvious exploit of running a difficult sequence on every tick, a minor mechanic will be detailed after this.)  \nIf possible, though it isn't necessary, a player's AI settings could be exported and imported, which any community of players would appreciate.  \n  \nFor the idea I mentioned at the start to work, there must be some limitation to the player's own abilities. What limitation do real people have in controlling huge empires all on their own? They can't do everything that needs to be done in a day in a day! So, the player's character will only be able to do one task at a time, limiting their power to do everything a large empire might require. (But in reasonable time, unlike in some MMORTS games.) Additionally, this means their AI will only do activities one at a time, and only at the speed they can, like a player. (Implementation of character abilities and stats could make some activities faster than others, but that will not be detailed here.)  \n  \nSo, to finish off the CKII idea of having sub-rulers, the player should be able to appoint other characters, sometimes who are players, to control parts of the other player's empire/(whatever players control in the game). To do both this and to knock out diplomacy between characters, the second major mechanic will be a treaty-based diplomacy system.  \n  \nWhat I mean by a treaty-based diplomacy system is that the players make their own treaties with other players, and all the game has to do is store the information and do what the treaty/contract says. Each player has to agree for it to happen (obviously), and the players even will specify how to break the treaty/contract. No other form of diplomacy will be present, besides perhaps war. The players can say, between any players involved in the treaty, who can control what. So, one player could make a treaty saying that another character will control these lands, but they have to pay a large part of the resources they get to the first player.  \n  \nTo implement that properly, the game would need a notion of control. I don't have any particular ideas, but a simple idea would be that one controls something if they have an army there.  \n  \nTo create the feel I intended by this, the game would need to be an MMO. I hope I've left enough holes in these mechanics to give whatever developer some creative space, and these mechanics don't define all the aspects a game like that would need, so there's space left here to be creative. (I didn't even mention a genre besides MMO!)  \n  \nHopefully the ideas I had aren't too ambitious. I don't know too much about making a game, but it feels like these mechanics are fairly close to the metal, and would fill enough features in a game to make it simpler. I feel like the diplomacy system makes that aspect of a game like this simpler and more fun."
5kv0eh,How has no one made a Jeremiah Johnson game? Like seriously?,"The closest thing I can think of is red dead but that doesn't quit cut it. We need a sandbox survival game set in the early North American days where you create a character and travel deep into the mountains or some other wilderness. Could have a rifle and fend off Indians from your log cabin settlement/house, or befriend them and trade with them. Could have all sorts of hunting/gathering systems, something like 7 days to die or the forest or something. Watch that movie and just try and tell me that theme wouldn't be perfect for a rpg/survival game. Could have endless character creations, Turok style Indian to old mountaineer "

5kqhrs,Moddable top down game engine,"Hello everyone!\n\nSo as you can guess, I ain't no developer, but I do like to tinker with stuff. Most of the success I had back than with the Warcraft 3 editor. Nowadays I do some stuff with Game Maker, although the net code is something that I find hard to wrap my head around. The other option would be Starcraft 2, I'm really interested in the possibilities in the new editor, but for my friends, it turns out to be expensive and/or demanding. Still I like to work on stuff that has multiplayer concepts, so I was thinking, wouldn't it be nice to have some sort of rts / rpg or tbs... or lets just call it a top down game engine or editor with similar system and capabilities. With 2d graphics for easier content creation for the wannabe modders, perhaps even a bit ""pixel artish"". Most of us are tabletop players, so we are more interested in the mechanics rather than graphics, but I'm not sure if there would be a feasible demand for that outside this friend circle. Still, just putting the idea out there, that is all, thank you for reading!"
5kp3a1,POKEMON LEAGUE NX,"http://imgur.com/a/i71Iw\n\nThe Image above says it all. Take the franchise in a more mature direction artistically and develop the complexity of the battle system. ""Pokemon trainers"" would utilize Pokemon Go as per usual, to farm; explore, evolve, develop and create player/team networks. The Pokemon League NX platform then becomes an extension of the app and the predominant cross-platform multiplayer battle system and management tool. An advanced, highly detailed, intricate and massively engaging global online Pokemon ecosystem.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nCreate a dynamic relationship between GO and NX wherein the only way to truly succeed as a trainer and reach a high level in either game is to play them both actively; this would give Pokemon Go a longer life and more relevance. The big issues with GO are the dodgy battle system, inability to battle or interface with other trainers directly, no level of true social engagement, lacking any type of relevant connection with the pokemon, dodgy app based visuals and tedious and repetitive gameplay that quickly become fairly redundant. GO is pretty much a farming game, there's no deeper meaning or objective.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nPokemon League NX would bring life and purpose to our Pokemon. I envision a turn based system much like the Final Fantasy series but with a far more active level of player involvement, more social engagement, a larger range of animations, character moves, strategic and statistical influence over the result of the battle.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTake the Pokemon Battle mechanics to a new level!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Social Hub:** Meet players on GO and battle them at home on the NX. \n\n**Pokemon Training:** Advance your Pokemon's skills by engaging in NX battles.\n\n**Gym Battles:** Create a valid reason to actually defend a gym, make them grand NX battles! The only way to take a gym is to attack it with NX. But the only way to engage the attack is via Pokemon Go. This localized link between GO and NX will create true relationships and rivalries between Trainers.\n\n**Community:** NX is an online game, create leader boards and ranks that extend from GO into NX. Allow real squads and teams to form so that you can attack and defend gyms that other members of your team visit. Currently the 3 Pokemon Go ""teams"" don't really serve a purpose. Scrap it, allow millions of teams to exist and actually give them a function.\n\n**Epic Visuals:** Remember Final Fantasy Summon sequences? Imagine those in NX with epic modern graphics. Watching your Pokemon engage in visually stunning and cinematic battles. But it's going to need a massive array of animations, and an engine that can create fluid and varied camera angles all the time. If the visuals and animations are repetitive it just won't be the same.\n\n**E-Sport:** Create a web based arena where people can watch Grand NX Pokemon tournaments. I've always marveled at the EVE Online community, its a wonderful thing. It would be great to see this have an equally engaged community. But until a Pokemon game actually has SUBSTANCE, it never will.\n\n**Organic Evolution:** Your Pokemon will actually reflect their true size, weight and age in NX; becoming truly life-like representations of the cartoonish creatures. This level of visual detail will lead to true relationships between trainer and Pokemon forming, NX will give your Pokemon a tangible reason to exist and a reason for you to care about its success or failure.\n\n**Customization** There are some incredible player customization systems in game land. Pokemon NX needs an advanced engine to make every pokemon ""model"" slightly different and with a progressive evolutionary path. Levels of customization will allow every Pokemon to be truly iconic, to make your Pokemon truly yours. Different personalities, characters, traits, appearance.\n\n**POKEMON VR**: One day in the near future VR and AUGMENTED reality WILL inevitably become a standardized global platform. When it does, imagine your life-like pokemon becoming a highly intelligent virtual pet that can interact with you. This would be the origin of the first truly interactive digital pet companions. Imagine putting on your Augmented Reality headset at a Gym in your local city, to then witness your 3 year old Reshiram http://orig02.deviantart.net/afad/f/2012/279/3/6/_reshiram__by_arvalis-d5gz268.jpg swoop down and land behind you  as you instigate a battle with another trainer. His choice, a fully evolved 4 year old 7""1 Aggron http://pre00.deviantart.net/e7fa/th/pre/f/2013/004/4/4/_aggron__by_arvalis-d5qfgeh.jpg then aggressively stampedes in to support him from behind a nearby building, dozons of people with augmented headsets quickly gather around the battle zone to witness the titans in combat.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThat's the future of gaming ladies and gents!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBut first, the Pokemon franchise needs to evolve. Move away from it's kindergarten origins and become a more substantial, mature and broader platform. The first step in that process is something like NX, the key is realism and substance.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThanks for reading!"

5kkldw,Civilian,"A game where you play as a civilian in a warzone. Your goal is to either escape the warzone, or survive until the war ends. However, there's no on-screen indicator of when the war will  be over. You'd be in a big city with procedurally generated units of enemy and friendly soldires that may protect you or hurt you. Friendly soldiers have a disposition to help you and enemy soldiers have a disposition to attack you, but enemy soldiers may help if you prove useful to them (like giving them some supplies or information), and friendly soldiers may abandon you if you inhibit them too much. You're able to fight against the soldiers too, but its discouraged as they're much better equipped than you. The city is wartorn, will lots of ruined buildings that you could take supplies from, but many will have other survivors in it that won't like you taking their stuff. You could barter with them to avoid hostilities, or just take the thing anyway and run/fight.\n\nIt'd basically be a war-themed survival game."
5kjiie,A different approach on zombie games,"Hi all,\n\nThis is my first post on this subreddit, and while I've been reading through and searching game ideas here, I haven't seen anyone posting the idea I got in my mind today. I apologize if someone has posted a similar idea here earlier. My game idea is as it is - an idea without a highly detailed plot or twists or anything. Feel free to give feedback and use this idea if you like.\n\n**The rough idea**\n\nI'd like to see the roles being swapped in zombie games: instead of being a normal and healthy person fighting against hordes of zombies, the player either starts the game as a zombie or turns into one in the beginning of the game. \n\nHere's the catch: the zombie which the player is controlling is fully aware of what he/she is and the primary goal of the game is to find a cure for the disease and cure yourself. While being a zombie, you are unable to talk and tell any human-NPCs that you are not going to attack or eat them. In order to survive, you need rotting or fresh flesh (either human or animal) for eating and for finding the cure you'll need human help as you lack the essential fine-motorics to prepare any medicines or handling any items on which fingers are needed for. So, to get a human-NPC to help and trust you in the first place, player needs to find a way to contact/interact with/message to the NPC that you're friendly and need help.\n\nSo, this is the rough idea that I had to get out of my head before I lose it. I might or might not work with it myself but you are free to use this and modify it to your purpose as you like. Mention me in the credits if you finish something. :P Thanks!\n\nEDIT: Formatting"
5kgyre,Ideas for a tower defense?,"Working on a tower defense game for mobile devices, need some ideas for theme and mechanics"
5kgntx,Just Game Philosophy,"Hello there. This post serves one purpose. I am trying to share my opinion on certain mechanics that exist and why they shouldn't, or vice versa.\n\n1) Healers\nHealers in competitive games are unsurprisingly essential to victory. Any support hero, even, takes this trait, as long as their bonuses are as beneficial as healing. However, this is a problem to game balance. In any sort of competitive team-based game, healers are important for one main reason: Out of all the roles, their potential is the most exponential (sorry for rhyme). After all, their whole gimmick is helping their teammates; so their impact heavily relies on how their teammates act. This means that at lower skill levels, they are useless, but at higher levels, they are impossible to win without. If one made a team-based competitive game in which there were no support characters, this would be 1 more balance issue out the window.\n\n2) Crowd Control\nAnother common mechanic is Crowd Control. Crowd Control refers to whenever an ability or weapon is capable of harming the target in ways other than damage. A well-known example is the hook; in many Mobas and some new shooters, a certain character can stun and pull in enemy characters. This is also bad for balance because, just like with support heroes, it's based on other player's skill. For instance, if a new Overwatch player picked Tracer and got hacked by Sombra, they wouldn't be affected too much; their use of Tracer's abilities did little for them. However, if a professional Tracer player was hacked, they would lose a huge chunk of their potential within the match. This means that Crowd Control's potential is also highly exponential-it gets better simply because you use it against better players, on top of your skill.\n\nThat's all I have for right now. If you disagree with anything I said here, or have some ideas of your own, feel free to leave a comment.  "
5kdjrc,"A fitness app combined with a ""clicker"" game.","""Idle"" games usually consist of the player repeatably clicking on the screen in order to gain currency, which can be used for upgrades. Upgrades can be used to make progress faster, by either increasing the currency gained per click, or making the process automated. Some examples of popular clicker games are Cookie Clicker, Clicker Heroes and Adventure Capitalist.\n\nMy suggestion is, instead of clicking on the screen, the player could walk or run instead in order to gain currency. This would be an interesting game to make, as the creator would be free to modify the themes and mechanics of the game as they wish. \n\nA player roaming through dungeons to slay monsters? A cow farmer from the Wild West? A homeless man setting up a lemonade in order to become a multibillionaire? A lone survivor setting up a base in a post-apocalyptic wasteland? Any of those ideas could work."

5k4ecm,A dating sim in which you play multiple male characters who must successfully date females of other species as to allow humanity into the intergalactic political scene.,"(Based upon this post; [\n[WP] You turn your Match Distance on tinder to ""Anywhere"". To your surprise you get a match that is 10^93 light years away. Thinking it was a joke you turn it off. 20 minutes later you turn it back on and it says they are 10^5 light years away and getting closer](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/5jx487/wp_you_turn_your_match_distance_on_tinder_to/) by /u/I_dont-get_the-joke and the amazing responses done by /u/ZigZagSigSag.)\n\n\nEvery life begins the same. You are a random man from around the world who, by using a dating app, has been matched with an extra-terrestrial being. You can converse with them for a set time, that timer being the distance they are away from the planet. So, let's say Queen Nu'ras wants to date a Texas gas station attendant and she is ten light years away. After sending her the Scorpions song of the same name, you realize that after an in-game day of chatting, she is nine light years away (Although it would incredibly impossible to travel 186,000 miles in a single day, let's go with it). So, you have nine more days to talk to this queen, figure out what she likes, what she doesn't like and what she wants to learn about Earth. You, using your budget and whatever money you can get on the side, have to play a date and hopefully show the queen a good time. When she lands on the roof of your workplace, you have to leave work and take her on the date you had planned how many days before. You show the queen the best time you can, talk carefully and hopefully don't annoy the alien that can probably kill you in a split second.\n\nFrom that, you've successfully completed a single date with Queen Nu'ras. However, you must complete two more carefully, as to establish humanity as an ally with their people, as the queen promises she will do it if you show her you're a gentleman. The queen will go into orbit, using her spaceship as her home, and you can plan out the next dates over a few days and take the queen out the following weekend. With the dates out of the way, you have set humanity on a good relationship with the queen's people and are booty ambassador for that species.\n\nThen the perspective changes to a French man and so on and so for until humanity sleeps its way into the intergalactic political groups it needs to. \n\n\n"

5k0tka,I have an idea for a Zelda-esque game... but I only have a single powerup and it's central to the entire game's design.,"If I stick to the core idea, it wouldn't really be a Zelda - it'd be more like a Portal where one idea is explored in detail.  If I simply add more abilities, I feel their lack of cohesion (unless I come up with something) would detract from the game as a whole.\n\n**Premise**\n\nThe core item is the ability to change gravity - or rather, in a top down zelda style game to instantly toggle into a platformer, with the relationship between the two perceptions of the same environments being the core of the game.  \n\nFor example, there's a barricade of floor spikes you can't cross.

5k0ew9,Room Escape/Puzzle game where the answer depends on what character you're using,"So the base of the game is room escapes, with many different rooms and puzzles to solve. \n\nFor example, say there are two characters. One is more intelligent but not very strong, the other isn't as inteligent but they're buff. \n\nThe room in question has one locked door as the only exit. The key for the door is in a safe with a number code, and in order to get the code you have to solve a math problem. The first guy would have to solve the math problem to open the safe and get the key. The buff guy, however, would just ram the door until it was busted (using a quick time event/minigame), and if you tried to look at the math problem with them, they'd just say ""I can't make any of this out"".\n\nOther rooms could introduce other obstacles like bars over the door, so the muscley guy would have to find bolt cutters or something in order to have a chance to bash the door. Or if he wanted to bust a window to get out, he'd have to move some objects over to reach it.\n\nThere could also be characters that were in between, like someone who could accomplish most of the strength portions, but would do some intelligence portions too.\n\nI haven't fully fleshed out this idea, so I didn't think in depth of ways to balance it out. But there it is."
5k0bf7,Idea for a 2D Adventure Game,"Hi @all,\n\nso just a few Minutes ago, an idea for a game just popped into my head. The longer I think about it, the more interesting it gets for me.\n\nHere's the idea:\nYou're playing a random Dude, let's call him Booker, in a Big Kingdom. You're coming off a poor Family and your biggest wish is, to become the King. To accomplish that, you have 3 options.\n\n**Option 1, the political way**: You go around several cities, try to spread your name, your way of the politics you would do, so that the current King gets overthrown and the people choose you, to be the new King.\n\n**Option 2, The Military Way**: You work your way up straight to the top of the Royal Army And then commit a coup against the King.\n\n**Option 3, A mix of option 1 and option 2**: You begin to work at the king's court as a simple Guard, then work your Way up to the personal Guard of the King, gather some political Friends (maybe other Kingdoms in the World?) and then overthrow the King right out of its own rows.\n\nBecause I'm not that long into gamedev as I wish I would be, I'm thinking about a 2D based Game.As genres I'm relying on Adventure maybe a bit of Action in it. Depends on the style you're playing the game.\nThis must be carefully thought out before I really go to the development. For me it was first and foremost about whether this was a good idea for a game or not.\n\nThe Options are just spontaneously conceived and may be changed or get increased to various more options.\nI hope the main idea is clear, and I really like to hear your thoughts about it."

In my mind, this game is graphically simplistic, similar style wise to Prison Architect, but in reality it doesn't need to adhere to any particular style.\n\nYou would have certain goals you can achieve, increasing the university's popularity in different ways. Your university isn't limited to being successful purely based on grades, though continual bad grades are likely to put off potential students, investors and staff. You university cal specialise in certain fields, unlocking new buildings, technologies, landmarks etc.\n\nAn important element would be humour and fun with the game, who wouldn't want to see the kids runing riot and partying and you having to try and 'control' it?\n\nLike i said, not a well developed idea but it'd be nice if someone can take this premise and make something good from it.\n\nPeace."

5pgsqo,A VR game where you're a bartender who makes cocktails and serves beers,
5pe9qn,An online space RTS with simple graphics but advanced mechanics.,"This is (in my opinion) my best game idea yet, and also my biggest. It is an online game with gameplay similar to Spore, but focused on only the Space and Civilization stages with a bit of the Creature Stage (more on that soon). You start out with your own custom species and an initial home planet and solar system for them to live on. For your species, you get to choose factors like classification (Reptile, Mammal, Machine, Insect, Planimal, etc), diet (Carnivore, Herbivore, Omnivore, Photosynthetic, etc), number of limbs, and a selection of body parts (heads, limbs, horns, teeth, etc). You can also customize your species's culture and select different moral codes/laws (genetic engineering, homosexuality, etc). With your solar system you can customize the environmental state and distance of your home planet from its star (as well as its number of moons) and the star type/age, while the rest of the solar system is randomly generated (none of the other planets will have sentient lifeforms). After that, it's time to join the game.\n\nYour species starts off slightly more advanced than humans (which don't exist in the game, but a primordial Earth populated only by very primitive organisms does). Using available resources, you must develop new technology and begin colonizing other planets, and eventually terraforming them to suit the needs of your species. You will eventually contact species of other players, and can negotiate diplomacy or declare war (weak species cannot initially be attacked). You can also genetically engineer the species of your own planets and others (including your own species) if your laws allow it, which can be done in another species customization menu. You must design buildings, vehicles, etc. Very similar to Spore but with deeper gameplay. All of this is balanced to avoid overpowered creations,\n\nThe universe also ages with certain in-game events. Stars will age and die, sometimes destroying surrounding planets, so you must constantly find new territory. Black holes form, galaxies merge, planets become rogue, etc. All presenting new challenges for the players to overcome. \n\nTo balance the challenge of making and supporting this game, I think this game would need relatively simple graphics. The graphics are up to whoever, if anyone, develops this."

5pc7t3,A multiplayer game that encourages/requires players to actually cooperate with each other?,"In every multiplayer game I've played with team warfare, (Halo, TF2, and modded Minecraft, that is), every player seems to just go around shooting random enemies, not even thinking about their teammates. I sometimes try to convince my team to get together and strategize to make it more interesting, but nobody cares. It seems that people today may even be allergic to thinking. I really want there to be an multiplayer FPS game where the players actually work as a group. I'm not sure how to actually get them to do such, but there must be a way."
5pbp6j,Any game with MTG IP,"And yes, I know they already exist. But they were all bad. My opinion is because they did not have the level of customization that is available within base MTG. Here's an example:\n\nMTG Moba. You will pick a hero, such as Chandra, but the abilities she has are not predetermined. Instead, you will take 7 red cards, and they will act as your abilities. You may take multiples, up to 4, and doing so reduces the cooldown.\n\nA lot more customization that the other MTG non-ccg, right? Feel free to comment your own ideas, or berate mine."

5pat9u,Twisted Metal in Space,"Customize and level up your starship, access to modules like weapons and custom engines for your ship to suit your play style (Very fast or high control?  Turrets or shields? Accuracy or spread?)\n\nPlay in scored matches with possible game modes as you utilize pickups and objectives to get a one up on the other team or players.\n \nLike you got the Kingdom hearts 2 Gummi ship customization, but it drops you off in a Twisted Metal /Rogue Trip Vacation 2012 stage, where might for example control points akin to the ""Hey Bill, Long Time No See!"" stage from Star Fox 64. \n\n\nFlight controller demo:\nhttp://tomahawkhomepage.x10host.com/newdemo/\n\n\nI know there are other places for what I'm about to say but:\nIf you were a fan of the Twisted Metal franchise, have ideas for a game like this, or just want to help out in any way, I am always open to it - I'm actually trying to develop this game - just hit me up.\n"
