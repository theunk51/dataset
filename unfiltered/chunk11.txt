i1vquu,RPG game where you find/unlock a skill after using it,"Hi, I like games where you have many skills and abilities but sometimes it hard to me investigate all these skills and understand thier benefits at start of the game. What about a game when you find/unlock skills after making some actions? For example the player hits enemy by sword and now you unlock ""swords"" skill that you could improve, or horse riding/swimming/cooking, etc. I think it could be cool motivation tool for players - many of actions and your ideas may transform into new skill that you could improve over whole game."
i1s2c7,A stealth game that involves the player character to hide in plain sight (I hope this wasn't thought of before).,"So I thought of calling this game, ""DeadMask"" where you play as a man who can kill people and rip off their faces and shapeshift into them but you won't get their memories so there are things that require thinking and deducing like noticing a ketchup spill in their shirt as to indicate he is clumsy so you have to retain their personality in order to prevent suspicion and speaking of which, there will be a Suspicion Meter that increases when the NPCs think you aren't playing the part correctly.\n\nThe game will have you collect intel and information for a boss. I haven't thought much of a story yet but if I ever in a slight chance make it then It'll have a good story."
i1qkl1,AI dungeon but an actual game,So theres this thing called ai dungeon ([https://play.aidungeon.io/](https://play.aidungeon.io/)) and i think it would be rly cool if someone made a 3D game that used machine learning just like AI dungeon
i1qbm6,ive always wanted a game thats like a mishmash of pokemon and slay the spire,"they're two pretty different games. ones a roguelike using cards, the other a monster battling/collecting game but they also have similarities. i took a look at ooblets which has a similar premise but fails to actually make the combat engaging, so i thought i could drip my 2 cents on how to possibly make \n\nmy proposal is that each monster has a unique set of cards. and every X amount of levels they can either A) add 1 of 3 randomly selected cards that have been pre-selected for the specific monster. discard 1 card, or not change your monsters deck. each level also grants your monster a small boost in hp and every metamorphosis of your monster can open up a wider aray of cards you can now add to your monsters deck when it levels up by X, as well as lock away certain cards that aren't that viable anymore to prevent the player from being locked away from using the new cards because of bad rng. and maybe have it so that the analogues of legendaries and pseudo legendaries have specific cards only they can get.\n\ni've thought about a possible typing system and honestly i think a potential fit would be something similar to slay the spire and how its has 5 card colors. (ironborn, silent defect. . .) and within these 5 card colors are 5 card types (attack, skill, power, status, curse) and i think the 4 card groups could possibly be mimicked and replaced with elemental typing. eg only fire monsters can use fire group cards and even then they can only use a preselected range of cards within the fire group. and if super effective attacks exist they would probably be the equivilent to a perm attack buff when attacking a monster with a type weak to the card color. i think it would be fitting if the game went with the basic elemental typing set with fire, earth, wind, thunder, water \~ though honestly you might want to add or remove some types to make things more complicated and convoluted or more easy and quick to understand.\n\nthere's also pokemon abilities which i think could also be mimicked. maybe some monsters have an ability which is equivalent to a relic in slay the spire? maybe they can gain new pokemon abilities as they metamorphose?\n\ni'm not sure if the game should have no consequences when losing like pokemon, or a mix of no consequences and consequences which locks you into a psuedo-nuzlocke where when a monster ""faints"" it literally dies and you cannot use it again but you can still heal your monsters whenever you want to at the expense of in game money. perhaps the game has difficulty levels which range from where your monsters faint when beaten (easy), then they die when beaten (medium), then they die and add a permanent curse card(s) to one or more of your monsters decks (hard)\n\ni've always thought that catching pokemon was a overly simplistic concept. you beat em up till they're weak and then you forcefully enslave them. i don't think you'd ever form a familial bond with your monsters if thats how you catch them. so maybe instead of slavery we impliment taming where when not in battle mode you can encounter monsters in the wild not in tall grass and feed/gift them items that you buy at the store or obtain after beating wild monsters or monster tamers. (something similar to the taming system in creature keeper.)\n\nnow how many monsters can you use it battle? i really think the game would benefit from having a smaller amount of monsters to use in battle (2-4) to keep things less complicated. and i think all monsters in your party should be visible and active in every battle you partake in. and the amount of energy you can use to play cards should scale according to how many monsters you have in your party as well as any possibly abilities your monster may have that boosts your base energy store by X. i'm not too sure if your hand should be kept after the turn, or tempoarily discarded after the turn to be replaced by some other cards in the decks of your monsters. i think it goes without saying that the decks should be constantly looping instead of having turn-discarded cards permanently discarded because there isnt a need for PP like in pokemon anymore (PP sucks so much, whenever i grind i always have to go back to the pokemon centre, so annoying)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nyeah thats it, thanks for listening to my ted talk."
i1pm60,Underground Melee only BR,"I had a dream or even a nightmare if you will, and couldn't help but think that perhaps, this might actualy be a decent BR idea.\n\nTo start, as every typically/traditional BR game begins with a mandatory lobby: Your avatar begins on an old salvaged train with 10 or so carriages, containing crew cabins, platforms, bar or restruant (typical set-up) where people in the lobby can get together, learn the mechanics like movement and generally follow the tradition of pummeling players as the count down timer shrinks.\n\nThis train, runs above ground, hurtling along a rickety abused rail line, with the occasional bump or groan through apocalyptical scenes - similar to any destroyed vistas seen in Metro or fallout games, or the movies snow piercer or Eli. The aesthetic appeal is to emphasize that the world is not a safe place above ground and the only obvious option is to remain underground whenever possible.\n\nOnce the train turns of into a tunnel to go under ground, similar to the plane or bus, it will follow the rail line along a predetermined loop around an old collection of stations, supply drop offs, maintenance accessways ect. The train would never stop and your only option is to jump off whenever you see the opportunity to do so. Remaining on the train is an option but would not be off benefit, however, disembarking the train would activate a bomb collar or implant that would remain in effect if you where of a certain distance of the train and would detonate if you struck a player. Once the train goes away, that device would deactivate allowing you to PVP but as the train remains on a constant loop, you would have to be mindful of what you are doing or how you behave as the train nears or passes you again later.\n\nThe story to justify this could be that you’re a prisoner sent out to scavenge and the collar is to encourage you to behave? \n\nThe goal would be similar to Escape from Tarkov where you need to scavenge supplies (Food, Water, Medical, Junk) and if you make it out, that is converted to currency for you to buy gear to take with you again on your next trip. The idea would be to jump off the train, scavenge, and jump back on the train before the timer runs out. You can do this by jumping off a platform or from an over hanging catwalk as it hurtles past - putting you in a safe area. Killing someone off the train would grant you the ability to loot their stuff, and the further you venture away from the train line, the more valuable loot you can find so it evolves a risk vs reward mechanic. Obviously, if you don't make it, you lose everything you went in with.\n\nThe main emphasize on the game - would be that there is only melee. Guns are broken or hoarded and not available anymore, ammo is so scarce that no one has any or simply will not sell them - whatever way it is spun, there is nothing but the pipes, chains, planks etc. you can find or crafted handmade bludgeoning or tools you make/buy and take with you. Imagine getting stuck into a melee with nothing more then a car door as a makeshift shield, a power drill with a fork for a drill bit as a weapon, wearing lose fitting stapled on tire armor and using what’s left of a motorcycle helmet, whilst blearing Classical Rammstein, as you watch the train hurtling closer, sweating, hoping that you can either kill or survive long enough before the collar activates. As this game is mostly in tight corridors, underground rooms, the idea is to force confrontation to be personal - perhaps something like a Banner lord or Mordhau style melee?\n\nWho knows, maybe you can have the rooms shuffle, rotate or be replaced with each other to encourage freshness on each playthrough?\n\nAnyway - that's my idea."
i1pjnd,Fully VR Elite Dangerous with a few tweaks,"Disclaimer: I KNOW THIS WONT HAPPEN, PLEASE DON'T KILL ME FOR MAKING A POST ABOUT THIS\n\nI think elite dangerous is a game with so much potential, but is mostly wasted on every thing looking the same, and endless mining. I would love to see a game that incorporates the VR support of elite dangerous, its giant galaxy, and also its procedural generation.\n\nTweaks:\n\n* Better procedural generation - I don't know how this works, but i think, if the galaxy was made by an AI that was given loads of sci-f pictures of alien planets, from star trek or stuff like that then it could end up looking cooler. Again, i dont know if this is how AI works, i just read some articles, but i think this could mean they could be some really interesting planets, like fully technology planets, such as coruscant, or planets with a giant hole in the side, and a space station filling up the hole. \n* Docking in bigger spaceships and stations and then having a battle - For example, like  the start of star wars, a new hope, a smaller spaceship could be sucked up by a tractor beam, and then the crew of the ship (players + NPCs)  would need to fight their way out, with guns. This could add more variety to a space sim.\n* Having stations more like no-mans sky - You can actually walk around them, and maybe go to a bar and shoot some people while your spaceship is being fixed. You could start a bar fight with NPCs. \n* Using motion controllers, not a joystick or gamepad - firstly, this would mean the player could have the gunfights without changing controller, and also would mean the player could use more buttons that just the ones on his virtual joystick. Like Han Solo turning on the Millennium Falcon. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jG5ickmIGz0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jG5ickmIGz0) go to 14:36"
i1o5lx,A game where the multiplayer battles take place on two opposing giants that are also controlled by players,"Basically, the idea is that the battlefield is on the bodies of two giants, and that's where opposing players fight. \n\nThat's the base mechanic, the rest is just hypotheticals I built up from that.\n\nIf you're playing an average soldier, you're not only responsible for killing the opposing team, you also have to protect the your giant, harm the enemy giant, and traverse the giant you're on. Furthermore, if you're playing a giant, you have to not only attack the enemy team, you have to be aware of the soldiers on  you before making a decision because your choices could give your soldiers an advantage or disadvantage (because YOU are the battlefield).\n\nIn combat, if you're a soldier on your giant and you want to cross over to the enemy giant, you have to wait for your giant to get close enough or be on whichever limb your giant attacks with.  If you're on the offensive as a giant, you could be hitting the enemy giant in the place that hurts the giant the most or in the place on his body with the most soldiers.\n\nSomething I think that would be very important for this type of game would be realistic times and weight for the giant's attack. For example, a punch couldn't be as fast a typical human punch; I think it should take anywhere from a dozen seconds to a full minute for a giant to wind up and land a blow (think like Pacific Rim: the robots don't deal consecutive punches in a span of a few seconds, they need more time to build that energy because of their size).\n\nTo explain this, I chose vague descriptions like giant and soliders. When I imagined this, I used ents cause I like ents. The soldiers could be different species of ents, with each species having a different niche to fill, and the giant would just be a bigger ent. I like using the ents for this ideal because it implies there's magic which opens up a whole other door to different things you could do. \n\nI'm proud of this idea but I haven't developed it in full, so please leave critiques or suggestions."
i1nsed,A 3d video game idea,"I would like to have it be a first person shooter, parkour, game. Ideas?"
i1ni8j,Ideas for 2D game?,
i1n6p6,Requesting mechanic ideas for a small-area tactics game where you can change the rules,"So I'm developing this little idea. You and your opponent both have a small number of units. I'm thinking Rifleman, Shotgunner, and Sniper.\n\nThey have vision cones and can only shoot where they or someone else on their team is looking.\n\nThe game is Turn-based tactics. Each player has a certain number of Action Points they can spend each round. Action Points accumulate, so if you don't spend, they get banked.\n\nThe map is small, like idk 10x10 to 50x50 tiles? Randomly generated with walls, doors, windows, and low walls. Sort of like Frozen Synapse. I'm contemplating adding more verticality to it though, like FF Tactics. \n\nEach player also has ""cards"". Each card requires a different number of action points to play on your turn. These cards change rules, such as:\n\n    1. Grenades bounce\n    2. Rifleman all have armor (1 extra hit)\n    3. All banked AP to zero\n    4. Low-walls convert to high-walls\n\nEtc. Etc.\n\nWhat I'm requesting is ideas for these cards. Cards might be one-time use, or they could be ""active"" like they remain in play until the player uses AP to dismiss them. There might be counter-cards, maybe cards that change units or add more units etc.\n\nI'm thinking the game is a cross between like Jagged Alliance 2, Frozen Synapse, Magic The Gathering / Hearthstone, Flux (the card game), and even Baba is You."
i1lehq,An actual viking type game,"A game where it's like sea of thieves but with viking ships and it has procedural generated islands where you can build your base. First person and top down both work for this style of game. You fight other players or just build your base, you could start it like sea of thieves did, super basic at first and builds on its self regularly."
i1lbky,A Hunger Games style “battle royale”,"So the idea here is basically just hunger games. I know you probably couldn’t use kids, so maybe jus sub adults. But you start out in the ring and get the supplies from the cornucopia. The kicker? Different maps to choose from, crazy right? I think another cool feature would be adding in hunger games that happened in the book, where you play as the main characters. There could be like a customization for your character in the “training” section of the games, where you make your character suitable for tactics and environment conditions (strength,speed,endurance, agility etc). That way, it’s not a guaranteed win, and adds difficulty to the game. Say you prepare for a desert climate, and get thrown into a winter map. You could craft weapons and traps. This would make a great PvP game as there would be many play styles in each match. This is just an idea I had, I know there are rough patches, but could always add improvement."

i1etmr,"An Avatar The Last Airbender based game, but with the mechanics of Ghost of Tsushima","Alright, it's a bit far fetched, but hear me out. A game where you play as a character similar to Zuko in his time when he got separated from Uncle Iroh. You alternate between playing as regular wandering character and a Blue Spirit inspired persona. You wander around in a journey to liberate areas from the dominion of the Fire Nation. I'm thinking of a waterbender or a rogue firebender. But it'd also be cool if you could choose your bending or if you'd be a non-bender while creating your character's skill tree.  \nIt'd also be cool to have more choices storywise and story consequences for liberating or not liberating certain areas. For instance: if you liberate too many areas in one place, the fire nation would hire highly skilled mercenaries that'd track you down and retake some areas, forcing you to be more strategic about your moves. Also, if you take an outpost, the forces would migrate and strengthen another area, or raze a village nearby in search of supplies.\n\nI haven't given it too much thought beyond this. If a dev is reading this, please make this. PLEASE."
i1eip4,A Roguelike About Spaceship Repairs,"Game plot: \n\n* You’re a contracted ship engineer fresh out of academy and hired to accompany various groups as they travel the cosmos. Be it repairing internal damaged systems that short out to voyaging outside to patchwork repair the hull during a fleet combat mission your job is to keep the ship together and at least somewhat functioning\n\nMechanics:\n\n* Each mission you're contracted for would hint at what sort of troubles may arise, from here the player can decide if the mission is right for them and what sort of spare parts they might need to bring to not die. Not all of them are combat missions either, I'd love to accompany a ship exploring uncharted space or probing asteroid belts for mining potential. However to make interesting situations the mission type shouldn't strictly allow only certain types of malfunctions, sometimes a trade convoy goes sideways do to unexpected software malfuncitons instead of the potential pirate attack you were expecting etc.\n* When buying spare parts the crew hiring you will give you a budget to get the parts with. This can however, be negotiated to be higher. If the player is feeling particularly risky they can even pocket some of the money and not spend it all on parts\n* Between missions is when you'll be spec'ing into classes. Be it by leveling skills through classes, buying better equipment for specific types of repairs, or getting the odd trinket that might do various things from improving the relations with specific factions to enabling bizzare scenarios that wouldn't occur otherwise\n* Four main skills:\n   * Wielding (so you don't fly into the void of space)\n   * Component repair (from air ventilation to replacing fried computer systems)\n   * Software (sometimes it locks up from various scenarios)\n   * Negotiating (more money or access to certain missions)\n* When using skills instead of a cut and dry yes/no the chance of successful repair should depend on skill level and correct spare parts, with spare parts being a way to do repairs you normally couldn't do at the expense of your wallet\n* Taking more jobs from a specific faction increases your standing with them and possibly decreases standing with other factions, making each run a bit different. This would also be a way to uncover more about the universe lore from the perspective of each faction which could make it so there is no good/bad guy\n\nI wasn't sure how to best shorten my idea so it isn't a super long read here. However if you want feel free to ask questions about any of it (this game is thought out enough to feel tangible for me) or check out a more detailed explaination [here](https://sushimus.github.io/)"
i1dkjk,The Runner,"Story driven open world game. The map is in medium sized sections in WW1 France. The player is a British runner fighting in WW1, Your job is to deliver a message to a general on the other side of France. I know this is just a video game version of 1917 but don’t slap me. On your mission, you encounter villages of french citizens, people fleeing from the conflict and other battalions. The map is similar to that game cuisine royale. It consists of sunflower fields, forest and cities. The main focus of the game is how war is bad, parts of the game being really beautiful lakeside cottages and then you come back later to just ash and ruins. The game should not have loads of UI at all, and rely on the player to hide from German soldiers, not to look at some bars at the bottom of their screen, heavily emphasising the need for tactics. At some point there should be a really decisive sniper battle that takes a long time, and is a huge relief when you win. There should be destruction, a bit like battlefield 1 and 5."
i1dcec,Skill/Talent Tree Mechanic - Sections of tree as lootable items.,"I keep coming back to the thought of having sections of a talent tree be lootable items. Basically pieces of a talent tree or web that be arranged however you wish.\n\nThis came to me after seeing the talent web in Wolcen, which allows you to rotate the three rings of talent nodes.\n\nI really just wanted to throw this basic idea out there, but this is what it looks like in my head:\n\n* The Web\n   * The talent web is empty to start, but contains regions of varying sizes and/or tiers.\n   * These regions can accept an item which I think of as a card, which places a specific chunk of web at the slotted location.\n   * Talent point allocation begins at a specific location (center/top) and traverses through linked regions from there.\n   * In order to place a talent point into a node, it must be linked to the starting node or another claimed talent node.\n* Cards\n   * Cards could be obtained in many ways depending on the game's design: Quests, Loot, Research, etc.\n   * Cards could come in rarer versions, being identical with the exception of the talent nodes power (10% damage increase on a rare card instead of 5% on a common card)\n   * Cards could vary in several other ways as well.\n      * The size of the card itself, possibly taking up more than one region of the talent web.\n      * The tier of the card, preventing it from being positioned too close to the starting node.\n      * The number of nodes. Some cards could contain a single powerful talent while others contain several.\n      * The directions in which the card links, making the player think about how best to organize their cards in the web.\n      * The number of talent points the card can accept. A card may contain 5 talent nodes, but only allow a total of 3 to be unlocked.\n\nI know when everything is stacked together is creates a very convoluted system, but I certainly wouldn't expect all of these ideas to be used together. I just wanted to get my ideas out there to possibly inspire someone.\n\nThank you for allowing me to throw my idea out into the void. I will sleep well tonight."

i1bmyy,THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING MAN,"an  survival problem solving game. You start off just in your office, or bedroom or something and then start shrinking for some reason. you keep shrinking throughout the game, after each mile stone maybe, so the game could take as long as you want it to be. an example of a puzzle is, you need to get off the chair you were sitting on, which is now 30 feet high to you. One way of doing it is to use the material on the chair to make a rope, and another being using some broken glass to climb down the legs, stabbing the glass into the wood. The aim is to find out why you are shrinking, and then stop. Combat against mice and spiders and eventually microscopic stuff."

Constantly having to iterative and improve to meet new requirements.\n\nOr lastly something like Papers, Please which isn't much management but you still have to balance your decisions between being precise and speed of handling the documents. But also the decision about what to spend your money on at the end of the day.\n\nHopefully you guys understand what I mean, and if not feel free to ask any questions.

i1266s,"A simple parry system with some added depth: You can either raise your guard late to negate all damage from an attack, or drop it early to stagger an enemy to open them up for a counterattack.","Most parry systems reward blocking just-in-time (JIT). Half of this parry mechanic idea is exactly this. The other half is like Smash Bros. Ultimate which rewards *dropping* your guard JIT. You can do one or the other, and each has their own benefit.\n\n* Raising your guard JIT will prevent all damage from heavy attacks. Heavy attacks will still do chip damage and stagger you if you only block normally.\n\n* Dropping your guard JIT will stagger an enemy and leave you free to quickly counterattack. Quick attacks usually come in strings, one after another, and this type of parry will cut those off.\n\nTo be clear, you *can* use either parry style on either heavy or quick attacks. But the former will not stagger quick attacks and the latter will not prevent chip damage from heavy attacks. That said, there may be times when you'll want to use ""the wrong"" parry style, such as a hearty enemy who relentlessly strings together heavy attacks (thus you may want sacrifice some chip damage to open them up for attack) or an explosive enemy who uses powerful one-off quick attacks that still do chip damage (thus opening them up for counterattacks isn't as vital as preventing chip damage).\n\nAlthough most enemy types prefer either heavy or quick attacks, they can all do both. Many enemies will often follow up a heavy attack with a quick attack, leading you to hold guard right as the heavy attack connects, and continue holding guard until you release it right as their followup quick attack connects... you parry two attacks in one fluid motion of a single button press."
i10onh,Idea for game where you design your own weapon,"You play as a character who has a weapon that you choose from a list of preset options and the weapon upgrades with choices, in reality there would be more choices but imagine you start off with a dagger and there are two choices, one you can increase the reach of the dagger by 12% and two, you can give it fire damage for 5 seconds afterwards, if you choose the reach option, the length of the dagger model will actually increase and if you continue to extend the length it will become a shortsword, and if you chose the fire damage option, red and orange glowing runes will appear on the blade or fire will come from the hilt and engulf the blade, you will have a completely unique weapon by the end of the game. At any time you can refund some of your points to then chose a different path, there will also be a secondary weapon so that if you have a grappling bow that either pulls you towards a spot, or can pull an enemy towards you, and you can then finish him with a stab with a sun flare dagger that disintegrates him. Their will be multiple elements, such as fire: which gives you chip damage and environmental damage, ice: which can freeze enemies in place until their comrades break them out or fire melts them out, water: which can be electrocuted, heated up so enemies can’t see through the steam, or can make enemies slip when stepping on a puddle, lightning: which does damage through water, weak damage through ice and a chance to paralyse, sun: which can instantly kill undead enemies and has a heavy chance to blind some enemy types, and moon: which can weaken sun and is primarily used to buff allies, and shadow: which has the ability to shadow walk, an ability that when in shadow, one can teleport to another shadow, you can have the same level of customisation on a armour that can grant passive affects and can provide speed or defence, an example of which is a helmet that can grant the ability of a bloodhound/wolf and can smell where enemies have been, a mount that can either glide, fly or grant a field of protection around it and 3 spells that can also be customised. The spells have a recharge time, like the abilities in battlefront 2, and the granting of special affects to your equipment might also work for a spell, you don’t instantly get a powerful buff, it takes time, take for example the bloodhound helmet: you first get the ability to smell special equipment and leads up to the full ability. I am thinking of it being 1-8 person co-op. I cannot make this as I simply do not have the time and resources, if someone from an AAA company or a person looking to make a new franchise comes upon this, please take this under consideration."
i0w799,Top down 2D - Dystopian RPG - 64 bit Single player,"So for this I am currently thinking about a dystopian story based on a fictional city that is economically suffering after a depression has occurred. During the years of the depression two sides form, blaming each other for creating a life of squaller. \n\nThe two sides are the Humans and the Anthros. The RPG will stem its choices from deciding which side to help take control over the vulnerable government. Heavy themes of racism, corrupted justice, and radicalisation will be present with the story and add dynamic to the situation. \n\nGameplay will be a little slower than most top-down rogue likes, having a perspective similar to stardew valley. Gunplay will take a minor role to focus on the RPG elements and encourage the player to explore and gather resources. \n\nIf you can help me elaborate on this idea please go right on ahead! I'll love to brainstorm. ^^"
i0u288,LOST BOYZ,"There has been a small amount of actually good beat em up RPGs. Lost Boyz is like what if Persona 5 met Castle Crashers with a resonating story about Brotherhood, Responsibility, Honor and Revenge with an art style similar to Breath of the Wild. The games main antagonist also acts both comedic and Deadly and the soundtrack uses NCS and Monstercat songs like Final Boss by Nitro Fun or Till it's over by Tristan. I think it will be a very good game what do you guys think?"
i0t9cq,Aliens V Predator (Dead Cells style),"My idea is of an Aliens V Predator game in the same vein as Dead Cells\n\n**Gameplay**  \n\- ""Roguevania"" or action-exploration-based Metroidvania  \n\- Play as either the Predator or the Alien, each with their respective strengths and weaknesses, weapons, skins, abilities, power-ups, etc.  \n\- Levels for each will start off completely different but may cross paths somewhere in the middle with it ending in different spots as well  \n\- Levels would also have the same random configuration that Dead Cells has  \n\- Have the same boss structure as DC as well but split between the two (6 in all, 3 for each)  \n\n\n**Predator**\n\n* *Story*  \nStart off captured in an alien hive on a planet inhabited by aliens and humans. The aliens are amassing an army while some of the humans are unwillingly helping them amass said army and the others are trying to destroy, study, or poach them. Predator needs to find his ship and get the hell outta there so he can return with reinforcements \n* *Levels*  \nHive, No Man's Land, maybe an outpost town, a colonial transport train crawling with aliens and humans...ending at the Weyland-Yutani Research Facility where his ship has been stored by the humans\n* *Bosses*  \nAlien Queen, maybe a slightly bigger and stronger alien (alien king?), a creature/animal that's part of the current planet's ecosystem, ending with a boss fight with the outpost general or maybe a predator killing android they've been working on \n* *Play style*  \nMore weapon based so he'll have a wider variety of weapons to use/collect. More closely related to the character in Dead Cells so technique/timing/exploration is encouraged more. Killing NPCs drops spines in place of cells.\n* *Player-death*  \nMaybe at the very beginning (when you need to escape the hive) show a few more captured predators so it looks as if you're another survivor trying to escape each time you restart\n\n**Alien**\n\n* *Story*  \nStart off wrecking havoc with a few of your alien brothers and sisters on one of the ships that left the planet the predator (and your hive) are on with the goal of expanding the colony by getting to \[the last level\] and cocooning yourself to become a queen (non-playable it's just the ending). The ship will eventually crash on a planet but whichever exit you choose determines the planet (and levels afterwards)\n* *Levels*  \nThe ship, planet A, planet B, various levels within each planet\n* *Bosses*  \nColonial General, rogue alien who is ALSO trying to start a colony, a creature/animal that's part of the current planet's ecosystem, ending with a boss fight with a predator that's been hunting you since the captured predator (your other player) sent a distress signal. His story assumes the other one is complete even if it isn't, which is fine because you don't run into the predator until the end.\n* *Play style*  \nMore speed based so focusing on the Dead Cells character's ability to move fast and climb walls. Weapons would be quicker and have a heavier impact but few in number. All would be biological (blueprints too) i.e. the little biters from DC would be face huggers.\n* *Player-death*  \nVery easy as this is an alien: he just pops out from another body on the ship\n\nI think the way Dead Cells is built awesome. It can be quick enough for you to play once or twice between things or you can spend more time and further your character while you're it. The weapon choices are great and the familiarity of them helps a bunch. A bunch more things but I digress.   \n\n\nThis is just an idea and I have no idea how to even test it. I have Dreams on ps4 but I'm not sure if it is capable of something like this. Also, copyrights."
i0suh8,Spherical 3D SHMUP,"A 3D shoot-them-up game where you can lock on one target and shoot them with your flying ship/vehicle while dodging incoming bullets by moving to the sides, up and down forming a ""imaginary sphere"" around the target.\n\nI thought of that game and afaik no game has done it before. Correct me if I'm mistaken.\n\nI can't do that game because I don't like shmups."
i0slla,Recipe for disaster,"I'm working on this rn but like to share ideas.\nIt's a runner game so like temple run,subway surfer style. You are a vegetable or fruit and you're running along a kitchen counter filled with obstacles.\nThe key feature that makes this neat is I'm trying to get inverse kinematics working on running so when you get hit by a blade and become lopsided. That affects you're running."
i0rzxd,First-/Thrid-person Magic-Combination Based Realtime Combat,"You might have heard of Magicka, well my Idea is somewhat similar but with   \na First-/Thrid-person-view (maybe even VR depends on you) and   \nonly two Elements of Magic that can be combined at once (One per Hand).\n\nI also thought of having MP, which is treated as a precious Ressource, because it only regenerates slowly. So the player would have to think of how they approach Enemy-Encounters and possible Puzzels (However I also understand that this would be hard to balance, so maybe just ignore this).\n\nThe Player would start with only one Element, but slowly gain more as the Story progresses, as well as the Ability to combine these Elements to achieve new results.\n\nSetting:  \nFor the Setting I thought of a City during the Industrial Revolution, where the previously essential Magicians in productions are being replaced by the newly developed Steamengine.   \nThe Leaders want to use this Chance to get rid of the mysterious Power wielded by the Magicians.  \nHowever the Magicians rise in revolt and you as the player take part in the Resistance.  \n\n\nDo to lock-down boredom I have put thought into possible Elements, their Combinations and also about a quartor/thrid of the Story written, so message me, if you are interested.\n\nOf course, Feedback would also be greatly appreciated.\n\nNote: As I'm not a native English speaker, I'm sorry for possible Spellingmistakes or the like."
i0inm1,Dungeons and Dragon: Table Top Tool Kit - Online,"I’ve been having random spurts of thoughts lately about a game I want to play, or create if I ever become talented enough to go so...\n\nIn this MMORPG type game, allows players ranging from 3 to 6 players in a traditional open world, rpg type of game... the special twist behind this game takes roots in table top rpg games like D&amp;D where at minimum 3 players join together under a dungeon master player who could (with tools provided) easily create an open world game for their players to journey together in and play together in. Essentially it is just DnD but with a legitimate video game where players can use ingame stats and tools to create the best character they want. A visual guide for players to play DND with each other... \n\nThe DM would be able to create their own NPCs with their own recorded dialogue, their own created assets, and pretty much anything! The base game would come with preset options for players who want a more quicker option, or whatever it may be. \n\nTL;DR: Visual D&amp;D"
i0iajc,Medieval fantasy world idea,"Im thinking a game set in medieval times where there are several different factions fighting for power over a map (similar to For Honor). But the factions would consist of all the cliché pop culture people and creatures. Humans, zombies, werewolves, aliens stuff like that.\nEach facton would be unique and have classes to pick from/upgrade and such\n\nControl over the map would be decided by PvP battles won for your facton (again similar to For Honor). \nThe PVP battles that decide land would be large objective based battles (aliens swarming a castle, humans destroying a hive) but other game modes would be available.\n If a match is lost then your facton looses a chunk of land. \n However the map that you fight for is an actual playable world where you can fight PvE or other factions for extra XP and gear as well as do your trading with other players.\nMap could reset every season and allow players to pick a different faction to play for!\n\nGame would be third person\n\nI know this is a big one but its my forst post ever and I wanted to write it down. I have lots of thoughts on this idea but I tried to keep it short and sweet!\n\n\n-Maple"
i0gmsz,A hotline Miami/hitman inspired spy game,"The game would be top down and play very similarly to hotline Miami, the main difference being combat and enemy behavior. Stealth is a big part of the game, with enemies having “vision cones” to know if you’ll be spotted or not. Walls are the only things that fully stop these cones, but you can duck below windows or couches in exchange for a slower speed. AI patrol around the level, rarely staying in one room unless they’re role is to guard. You can use non lethal melee weapons you pick up around the map to knock out enemies whose bodies can be dragged to be hidden or have their neck snapped. Lethal melee Weapons will kill them instantly but leave a bloodstain that can’t be cleaned up and enemies can detect. \n\nEnemies who see blood will stop search the room they found it in. Enemies who find a body will run to the alarm. If the alarm is activated all enemies will form groups with other enemies close to them and search different rooms. The maximum number of enemies in a group is 5. If there aren’t enough enemies to form a group of 5 the group will continue with less members, and any enemies they come across in a smaller group or alone will join up with them. If an enemy spots you they will fire at you, with the sound of the firing working the same as an alarm. \n\nYou can throw coins or other items found around the map to distract guards, similar to the coins in hitman.\n\nThis game would also have the disguises system from hitman working almost exactly the same. The main difference is if enemies discover a body whose clothes have been taken and the alarm is activated then some enemies who couldn’t previously detect you in costume now can.\n\nSpecial Enemies\n\nDogs: instead of a cone they’d have a circle around them, as they detect intruders by smell not sight. Dogs would be able to detect you even if they haven’t seen you or if you’re ducking behind cover. If they detect you they’ll bark loudly causing surrounding guards to run towards the alarm and then attack you. \n\nCameras: would work similar to guards except that they are either static or rotating. If seen by a camera the cameraman (who is in his own room in the map) will run to activate the camera. The way to disable the cameras is to find the camera room to take out the cameramen and destroy the computer. You can also take out an individual camera by shooting it with a silenced pistol but the cameraman will go to check on the camera. Once he sees it’s been shot he’ll activate the alarm. You can use this as an opportunity to take out the camera however if you haven’t destroyed his computer then any passing guard who enters the room will be able to take his place. \n\nWimps: if they spot you they will run to the alarm instead of attacking you. If the alarm is activating they’ll simply run and hide.\n\nThugs: require two hits to knock out but only one hit from lethal weapons to die.\n\nCommanders: they will always detect if you’re wearing a disguise. They can tell if a guard is missing from their patrol route or guarding station by entering the room they went missing from at which point they’ll search the whole room. If they find a guard who is searching the room due to finding a bloodstain they have a 70/30 chance of either scolding the guard into going back to its position or calling other guards to search the room. They will always scold the guard back to position if you used a distraction. If you disguise yourself as a commander you can order guards to leave the room, but there is a 10/90 chance one of them might alert another guard, at which point that guard will search the room they were ordered out of. If they don’t find you the commander will tell the guards to go back to the room.\n\nMissions would the objective of assassinating a person or persons, with some secondary objectives. These could be to recover documents hidden in another room (maybe even in a safe with a specific guard having the key). Another objective would be to rescue a prisoner. You’d have to escort him to the exit but as the prisoner isn’t a stealth master like you he’ll most likely be detected so you’ll have to already have cleared a room."
i0ejx5,Dodge! A Local/Online Multiplayer Dodgeball Themed Game,"So at the beginning of quarantine I started working on a project called Playtime Blitz which was meant to be a compilation of 4 minigames based on popular childhood games such as dodgeball, capture the flag, floor is lava, and Tag. Well I started first by programming dodgeball and after spending a long time adding new mechanics and just generally programming dodgeball I really wanted to focus on it. So I decided to change the game idea!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo Dodge is going to be a local/online multiplayer game based entirely around dodgeball. There are going to be multiple modes such as Classic mode where you try to be the last team standing, a point based mode, a capture the flag mode where u use dodgeball to defend yourself, and a king of the hill type mode. There are going to be multiple characters to select all with their own unique dodgeball abilities whether it be throw a fast ball or throw multiple balls at once.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe game only started development about a week ago however I have started a discord to start building an audience for this game so if you are interested, please feel free to check it out!\n\n[https://discord.gg/h3p564H](https://discord.gg/h3p564H)"
i0cq0x,Is there a market for recreational shooting?,"Hey guys. I was looking online for some games and I couldn't find anything besides either some old games, or really bad ones. \n\nI'm talking specifically about shooting first person shooter games that don't emulate real guns. So anything like laser tag, bb gun, or paintball. God, even a game where you're at an amusement park and you have to play games to win your girlfriend enough toys.\n\nI believe these could be very easy to make. Since there would be very little in terms of upgrades, very simple map design, small variety in weapons. The most complex thing would probably be the character customization screen."
i7fu1a,Magic in the game is like coding,"Magic is like an ore in this world, called maz. Just saying I got this from a book and thought it would be cool if it was a game. Would be first person/third person. Your choice. Could apply spells to weapons, guns and places\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Core Strains\n\nFiraz - Creates heat, fire and explosions. Can burn and melt things. Can make a spell explode example; make a ball of healing water explodes into healing mist.\n\nTerraz - Creates earth, and grounding effects. Can entrap enemies and make earth shields.\n\nWataz - Creates water and flowing effects. Can wash away enemies and make fire flow like water\n\nAeraz - Wind and airborne effects. Can blow away enemies and can be used for flying\n\nNullaz - Antimaz. With no augments it is a shield if the maz is concentrated enough, it will break through. Magnaz can also help break through.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Perceptual Strains\n\nObscuraz - Illusion and concealment. Conceal yourself and others. Distract people with illusions.\n\nSongaz - Auditory effects. Add sound effects.\n\nSunnaz - Light and darkness. Used in a slider along with colours.\n\nScentaz - Olfactory effects. Used for side quests where you make a flower scent for someones house\n\nFormaz - shape and size. You can choose a shape and size. Be careful, bigger size spreads out damage and if you make it too weak you won’t do any damage.  \n\n\nThe Augmenting Strains\n\nMagnaz - Raw power, amplification. The more Magnaz you use the less slots in your spell you have\n\nMotaz - Motion. Used in a slider to show speed\n\nVitaz - Health and vigor. Healing effects\n\nLinkaz - Binding or tying. chain reactions and traps"
i7fnmq,Pac-Man meets Tim Burton,I have an idea for an Pac-Man game the gameplay and plot would be some similar to the Pac-Man world games the plot is Pac-Man is trying to get his family or something back from the ghost world. the games whole style will resemble a Tim Burton/nightmare before Christmas look. the ghost world look would be more inspired by Halloween town from the nbc I the enemies will be ghost skeletons and zombie pacmen etc have a few boss and level ideas  penhead or Pacheead a pinhead parody for an hellraiser inspired level and a demon boss called pacifier or pachomet like baphomet and Lucifer a carnival theme level a forest theme level and graveyard level the game will have dark and weird humor like a thirsty Pac-Man zombie ripping off a arm or another pac zombie and drinks it’s blood I know it’s not that original and fleshed out but it’s just a silly idea that I had
i7ctpl,Time Loop mystery,"Work something mundane. Easy mini game, making coffee? Cocktail? Talking to customers. Asking questions, learning about them. Maybe if you’re too slow you miss out on talking to people or certain dialogue because they’re upset. You die or something happens at the end of your shift. You wake up and it’s the morning of the day you died/something supernatural happens. See the same people. Ask slightly different questions, find out what happens and stop it. Keep looping until you solve the puzzle preventing your death/catastrophic event, ending the time loop."
i78jcy,Mirror's Edge Tag,"I stumbled upon a bunch of WCT (World Chase Tag) videos on youtube, and I was thinking that it would be pretty fun to have a Parkour-Oriented game where it's literally just tag. No powerups or special abilities, just really fine-tuned movement and crap. I think it could be fun if done correctly."
i77aof,An Open World Game Where You Make The Story,"Honestly A Game where you can do whatever (sandbox, open world, rpg) type of game would be fantastic. The idea of being able to do whatever you feel like without being forced to do the main story line sounds like so much fun imo. For example one story line could be a fishing based one where if you catch a big enough fish the fish market or whatever you sell it to could fill you in on a rumor which could turn out to be real or fake, almost like a bounty. This game could be a mix of skyrim, red dead redemption, and the witcher. You could  for example just be a blacksmith and make money that way without doing any quests, or you could be a bounty hunter and track down wanted criminals without a guide (tracking footprints, finding scraps, etc). You could become a criminal and rob people and create a gang. This game probably won't become a reality due to how complex it would be to code / design, but I feel like it could be done. This isn't necessarily a request, but I felt like throwing an idea out there."
i76tid,Survival in a cursed city,"This is an idea that was inspired by Don't Starve Together and Silent Hill 2. I really like it but the subject matter is a bit too dark for me to delve into. If you get a creative spark from this idea, cool!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPremise:\n\nYou are a child who becomes lost in a town where most people either don't care about you or actively try to hurt you. There might be eldritch horrors too. You have to survive by stealing, scavenging and property hijacking, among other things. You might be able to make deals with people in the city, but be careful or you'll be betrayed. Will you ever be able to find your way back home?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome possible features:\n\n\- Gambling minigames\n\n\- Morality: At the start, your character is innocent and can only hurt others in self defense. Traumatic events can make you more able to commit something truly evil.\n\n\- Multiplayer"
i72kvl,Combination of the classic games snake and pong. Good idea?,"I have an idea to combine the two classic games pong and snake.\n\nIn classic snake, you should eat pills to make your snake longer and avoid colliding with yourself and the walls.\n\nIn my idea, you start as a long snake and get shorter for each pill. The game also includes a ball (pong) you must keep alive so that it does not collide with the walls. The game gets harder because your snake gets shorter and shorter and its harder to bounce the ball against your mask so that it does not touch the walls.\n\nYou die if you touch the borders  \nYou touch your own tail  \nAnd the pong combination, You die if the bouncing ball touch the borders.\n\nI have done a super simple skiss: [https://imgur.com/a/rCHSIpT](https://imgur.com/a/rCHSIpT)\n\nIs it a good idea? Steal it if you want or maybe I can do it one day (if you think its good)?"
i71vmi,Lawn Fight!,"Lawn fight is a game where you fight online, with everyday materials. Such as Leaf Blowers (which can be used to pull or push enemies), or even s’mores n spray (which could be a smore on fire used with flammable spray to make it like a flame thrower). These are just some fun ideas that I thought of! It would be cool for more ideas though. Would you play a game like this?"
i70mkk,Game where you play as a god... kind of.,"I recently had an idea for a game where you play as a god, but not in the way you think. You start out as a cloud hovering over someone’s head while they sleep in Medeival times and you say to them “I am a god, spread my wonder to others, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_” you would then tell the sleeping person what happens after death, this will shape their belief of you, and the first 30-40 minutes or so are just your followers asking you questions about what you look like and what kind of god you are, you will slowly spread your power until the fun begins, you finally get enough followers to manifest, not fully, but maybe as a dementor like being, or angelic or demonic, maybe not humanoid entirely but just enough for your followers to see you. You can attack other religions and once you become formed, you live in the houses of your believers until they build you a shrine, then people can make wishes or whatever you do. The you will upgrade to multiple, acting as hubs for your supernatural energy, sacfrifical offerings give you power, but if the cost is the fact that if a god with a place of power, say the king is a believer in another god, that person would be outlawed. You can try to get other people in powerful places. Your form might become bigger in size requiring more and more followers to maintain your form, or it might condense with more and more mystical energy where at this point it becomes reminiscent of Skyrim and Destroy  All Humans on coke, with you flying around and wrecking cities, bringing empires to their knees..... If you want to. You can just be boring and help people."
i6v5ut,A dangerous apocalyptic game with gameplay sixth senses.,"I dreamed it and thought it was fun. I'd say the game looks similar to a zombie game or a war game. But there are a lot of characters doing things around you as well.\n\nThe special mechanic is that simple actions can have life threatening results. Buildings are super dangerous. Banana peels? Rakes in the grass? Animals suddenly going manhunter? Ladders collapsing? Trip and fall and hit your head and you're out for hours or days?\n\nSo in this game, the starter character has the ability to tell if their action will cause a tragic turn of events to unfold. They might be able to avoid some dangers, but the people around them will constantly be setting off natural traps.\n\nOther characters also have special senses and such. Why did character x get hurt, but character y was not injured at all? One power is the ability to know how to cancel out a danger. It might be that holding hands with them does it, or wearing a bracelet, or having their eyes closed.\n\nThings that you don't have to know to trigger them. That's the key to the mechanic. Also, one sense can't necessarily make you untouchable. They're imperfect and often not good enough to be able to save someone, but maybe you could guess right. Or maybe a group with several senses could band together for safety.\n\nAnother part of the game is predetermining the who, what, how, where, when, type stuff, so that every ability can potentially detect some element of the danger that a character is headed for. Another ability would be seeing who is headed for danger and how severe it will be. Another one would be being able to see other people's dangers, as not every event will trigger for every character.\n\nIt could be a real gritty horror game, or it could be a lighthearted comedy based on how you look at it. If it was made to be very difficult to survive, very emotional, very suspenseful, with every character being important, then it would become very important to use your powers, and you'd invest time into helping people. If it was made to be easy, with lots of unnecessary extra characters falling off of bridges, or just accidents where no one gets hurt, with silly commentary, like ""there goes another one"" when something happens, and bright watercolor art styles, it could be a fun easy adventure that you just run around in."

i6p0q8,Nice FPS with some extras,I got an idea recently - idk if it already is a thing\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBasic Idea: \n\nYou spawn in teams or solo (depends on gamemode). Then you are going to run into different directions. You have only got 10 respawn tickets (can change in settings before game). \n\nYou are searching for mines or similar and find some ores. You mine these and smelt them and then you can craft some primitive weapons out of it. after some time you can craft some firearms. \n\nYou have to build a Base where you can respawn after an hour or so. (if not then you get kicked out of this game)\n\nThis Game will go over days if not weeks (idk if people are interested in such gamestyle)\n\nIt is first person only\n\n(This is inspired by a minecraft series but it could work in photorealistic graphics as well)
i6n83z,Slashers-A New Spin On Battle Royal,"So I’ve had an idea kicking around in my head for a few days now, a new spin on the Battle Royale genre. I am calling it Slashers!\n\nPicture this, you and the boys are queuing up to play Slashers. 80 Players are in the lobby and your ready to play your first match. Where ya dropping? Not up to you, you spawn in at a random location. You and the boys grab weapons in the first person and start going after the other 72 players in an attempt to achieve victory!\n\nExcept you realize that there is no storm, and that there are only 76 players on the map. Where are the other four players? You ask this question just as your ambushed by a chainsaw wielding undead lumberjack who cannot be killed and proceeds to put your whole squad in the ground.\n\nThis is the major difference Slashers brings to the BR formula. Instead of a storm, four players are randomly selected to become Slashers, unkillable horror villains who can warp around the map and use special abilities and gadgets to hunt down Survivors. And as a survivor, you’ll have to use stealth and wits to outmaneuver both your opponents *and* the Slashers hunting for you.\n\nIt’s PUBG meets Apex Legends meets Dead By Daylight. Do your best to survive, and remember that there is no storm. *only Slashers!*"

I am looking for something with:\n\n* Base/Area Management\n* Exploration/ Resource Gathering\n* Resource Transportation\n* Production/ Creation of Goods\n* Optimization/ Logistics \n*  Research/Tech Progression ( ie not everything is available right away)\n\nOptional:\n* Combat/Survival\n* Controllable character\n\nI would not like to have the game be a business sim, as I don't want the game to become about wealth accumulation or micro management. \n\nLet me know if you guys have any ideas even if they don't meet every requirement."
i6ivc9,Lords and Heroes,"   \nThe Core Gameplay Loop is Base Building -&gt; Exploration -&gt; Adventuring -&gt; Conquest.\n\nThere are two aspects, Lords and Heroes.\n\nThe Lord’s view is an RTS fashion, allowing them to see only as far as the fog of war cleared by scouting units or fellow Heroes.  Lords are nothing more than Heroes who have taken charge of a Township, the Player playing the game in a top-down, real-time strategy style mechanics, complete with resource management, researching more advanced unit types, setting build ques, and issuing orders to military units.  In the Overworld, the Lords can deal with threats of Armies and Rampaging Monsters by sending the Town’s Army out to deal with the threat.  Yet they are unable to deal with threats from Dungeons and Ruins and must rely on either setting out and contending with it themselves or relying on a Hero by issuing a Quest.  When they are not in the key building, issuing orders or overviewing their Realm, a Lord is little more than a Hero of an Appropriate Level.\n\nHeroes have a third-person perspective, hack, slash, and fireballing mechanic of an action RPG.  The Heroes are free to contribute to the construction and maintenance of the starting Town, but they have their own gold supply, earned from defeating monsters and completing quests.  They can use the gold in a town shop (once it's built) to buy consumables, weapons, and armor to replace their old gear as they progress in level.  While the Lord can deal with Armies that may threaten their Realm, they may issue ‘Quests’ to Heroes to deal with threats delving in Dungeons and Ruins  Heroes may even be provided backup with attached military units provided by the Lord.  When a Hero has their own Unit, they can issue attack, defend or even hold orders, and little else.  The troop types in the Heroes Unit will defend or even heal their Hero, earning a bit of experience and leveling up as they go along, yet when they die, they are dead and they are not coming back, at least, willingly.\n\nThere are different Factions and DIfferent Hero Class to each, obvious strengths and weaknesses, with Heros and Lord keeping experience and equipment, though they lose experience and equipment when they fall in battle.\n\nConsidering how Gamer’s Workshop is looking to License AAA games, this idea offers a unique take and play in comparison to games that will be either pure strategy or pure action.  Think of the first game taking place in the Core of the Empire of Man, in Warhammer Fantasy, wherein the players are charged in putting down a Rebellion in the Ostland Region.  \nThe player creates their Character, and molds them in a direction of say, a Greatsword, or a Warrior Priest of Sigmar, or even a Bright Wizard, then starts their Campaign by selecting a section of Ostland to establish their base.  The game transitions to a map and the ‘Lord’ takes control of a township, ordering peasants, establishing a garrison, and exploring the map from an RTS point of view.  A Friend wants to pop in with their created character, and essentially the pop in friend gets a few troops from the Lord and sets off to take down a patch of rebels on patrol.  The game would be situated for long play, and if that friend is called away for an emergency, they can save their character and log off, and any troops attached to them would return to the Lord'’s control.  \nRegardless, as the Players march through the campaign, more units are unlocked to be used in battle, and more dangerous factions, like Chaos, or even the Vampire Counts, could emerge as a primary antagonist in the region.  \nYet if the Players choose to go to a different region, say Wissenland, they could deal with Greenskins, Orks and or Goblins in general, with Dwarven Allies.  \nSpeaking of Allies, New Order Factions could be introduced through DLC.  Dwarves, High-Elves and such, with their own unit Trees and Campaigns.  The Forces of Destruction and Chaos are not left out, allowing players to choose that side and consume the World ina True End Times, all of which is focused in Regions around the Empire, at first, then other locations across the Old World as the game is expanded on.  \nHeroes brought in by other players can seize townships and fortresses on the in-game map, becoming their own Lord and churning out their own armies and units (though if they log off in-game control would go to the Host Lord), and though non-canon, it would have unique gameplay feel to have High Elves reinforced by Greenskin allies, trying to defend the shores of  Ulthuan,  Don’t AT me here, just saying the game would be non-restrictive in forcing players to ‘choose’ a side because I am suggesting this to be a PvE game.  \nYou could also have free-play maps, where all unit types are immediately unlocked, with all-out war amongst all the factions.   \nAs for how many players can be in the game?  Well, if the Host Lord has a Beefy System, perhaps Four would be the max.  Otherwise, if the maps are big enough, and if Players can establish their own Servers, maybe more, with a minor persistence going on to where the War never stops, and battles for regions would last for days.  The game would have to feature a ‘smart’ pause, where if no one is on the server, the game pauses.  Yet if there is but one player online, then the AI would focus solely on that player's activity, and while that player is online they would have complete control over all the forces allied to them.  \nJust an Idea. :)"

i62mkc,Guild/Faction ideas,"I'm trying to think of Guild/Faction ideas for a game that I want to make. I'm in my brainstorming stage, but I've only come up with the generic Fighters and Magic guild. I would really appreciate some suggestions and inspiration to get my creative juices flowing."
i61rn9,I just saw this and here's a CRAZY IDEA!,"Why not become the first online operated Game Dev team? So all these ideas CAN be created. With the 33.1k members in this thread all of the skills necessary to do so would be covered. I myself have been a game dev at heart since I was little. I have tons of ideas I want to create but I don't have a team to make them. I am not technically savvy due to being a Dyspraxia/ADD sufferer but I am very creative and innovative in game design as I am an INFP. I can write a great Game Design Document and I graduated university in a 3 Year Game Design Course at University Campus Suffolk. My passion for Game Design is very high and creating games for a living has been a dream of mine ever since I played Final Fantasy 7 on PS1. Any analytical types got any ideas on how something like my proposal could be achieved? I paid a web developer £100 a month for 6 months to create a website to do this for the Game Dev community not being served. But he took the money and never delivered anything it was a complete waste of time and money but my intentions were good. The Game industry will never give us a simple Game Dev engine with intuitive easy creation methods so I want to be involved in making such a software. I know I'm not the only one who wants to create games but can't due to money or some other limitations. I'm proposing we take back our power using the internet and begin something GREAT to rival the AAA companies. My website was going to be called Project Creality but it doesn't have to be called that. I'm also not proposing I be the head of this or anything I don't believe there should be one at all we just use the skills we have to help eachother create games. My skills are creativity, ability to think outside the box, overall game design and Narrative Design after studying story with John Truby. My ultimate goal is to create an RPG as good as or better than Final Fantasy VII. My RPG is called Starseed: Critical Eclipse. Thanks for reading, what do you think?"

i5z81l,murder=brains. a game where you do demonic blood sacrifice to increase your IQ,"this game is about a boy who is having trouble getting good grades, so he decides to make a deal with a demon, in exchange for the brutal bloody murder of other students he will increase your IQ for the test.\n\nin this game your goal is to murder enough students to pass all the tests, the bloodier and messier the murder the more the demon is fed but also the harder it will be to clean up, the kill that satisfies the demon the most is actually kidnapping the student and having the demon eat them at the summoning circle. satisfying the demon gives you two things: 1:a small permanent boost to your IQ 2:a large temporary boost to your IQ. so while a sacrifice is always nice its the most effective right before a test.\n\nas you go through the school year the tests get progressively harder and many of the lower grade students leave, to it gets trickier as there is more need for extra IQ and less targets to sacrifice.\n\nthats basically the game, i know the perspective and gameplay aren't quite clear but this is the main concept."

i5rmpg,Game Ideas Needed!,"Hi! I'm new to game development and have never made a full-on game, just small games to learn the process game development, and I've caught on pretty quick (as with most things). However, I seem to suffer from the same thing I'm sure many other beginner game developers have: An awful creativity. Now, you might say in response to that, ""Well, if you don't have creativity, you shouldn't be a game developer."" And you're partially right, but what I mean by ""awful creativity"" is that I have trouble with the idea creation process if that make sense. Give me a writing prompt and watch me write a short story in an hour but tell me to go write a short story and it would take me forever.\n\n**TL;DR** Can some people give me some good ideas for a game?"
i5r5u1,a cool idea.,"you know those games where all you do is explore and enjoy the scenery? well, imagine a game like that, but set in a free guy kind of city. where chaos and death is everywhere. basically you just walk around a city filled with overpowered people fighting each other. every person is unique and has their own power. you have no powers and are simply invinsible, allowing you to survive the city as you take your walk and watch the chaos unfold around you."
i5pyo8,A game where you play as a Native fighting off Norsemen Vikings invasion?,"Vikings landed in the Newfoundland but meant with resistance from nearby natives, the game could be very similar to Ghost Of Tsushima"
i5o8iw,An ultra-hardcore single player shooter,"I’m thinking of a solo FPS where you play as a mercenary delve into facilities and fight their inhabitants to collect a reward like a gun, money or a gadget from your employer. The twist is this: if you die, you get banned from the game for a full day with no appeal whatsoever (unless of course you died to a glitch etc..\n\nI feel that this would make players much more careful about dying and actually get worried when they’re low on health.\n\nThoughts?"
i5o0nj,Integrated magic cheat system,"Okay, this one is a doozy. Hear me out. This could be put in practically any game that uses magic.\n\nInstead of activating your cheats by using the command line or by some button combination, you buy one-time use potions.  Now I know this isn't exactly a cheat, but it's as chaotic as them. These potions would have a random effect. There was no indication of what they could do. The game could even make them all secrets. The potion could, for example, cause damage or increase size, kill, make invisible, change color, make something explode, give off radiation, make anyone into a chicken, et cetera. You would not know until you used it. But of course, all the effects would be similar to cheats in games, maybe even have ""God mode."" \n\nThe player could use it on a boss while not knowing if it'll make him harder or easier to beat. I think this could be super fun and chaotic if made rare."

i5kkwm,Medieval game where you start as a peasant and train to become a Knight of the Round Table,"The idea is that you start off as a peasant and look up to the Knights of the Round Table, and you tell your family that you swear you will work your entire life just to become one. After the prologue, it skips to you becoming a young adult and then the world opens up to you. You get a horse, a sword and shield, and complete missions to become a Knight of the Round Table.\n\nThe mechanics are similar to most rpgs. Leveling system with points to make you stronger but without all the pointless abilities that just do basic stuff like (Increase health by 10 points). Parkour would also be a mechanic like in Assassin’s Creed. Weapons and equipment wouldn’t have a simple “higher level=better” system, instead there would be different situations to use certain equipment. \n\nThere would be a main quest line and side missions that each have their own unique story, as well as certain allies that come with them (like the Guns for Hire I’m FarCry 5). Exploration heavily encouraged.\n\nThis is my dream game especially after hearing about the cancelled Ubisoft King Arthur game. I love knights and would love to see the time period more.\n\nTL;DR: Ghost of Tsushima with Knights"

i5gidc,Cold War Grand-Strategy Game,"Hey guys! I've been thinking about making a game from the Cold War, something very close to Hearts of Iron IV with some Total War elements. But I don't want to make an exact copy of HOI. Any ideas on how to improve the game itself and make it differ from others? There would be 2 campaigns, Korea and Vietnam war in each you could play as any nation in the world, the main ones would have focus tree. I was thinking about implementing actual battles like Total War does with army micromanagement. What's your opinion on this idea?\n\nThanks for your time."
i5g0rg,A Twist Isn't A Game Idea,"I've seen like 50 ""An RPG but you start with all skills and have to choose ones to get rid of over time"" posts. It's such a bad idea, and it gets upvoted every time.\n\nThere are reasons games are the way they are, you can't just throw an edgy twist on a core game mechanic for no reason and call it a game idea."
i5eiol,Quite inspired in lovecraftIan histories,"""Every so often, dreams become reality, and reality becomes dreams, what do you do? You wake up, but sometimes, you're not the one who is dreaming..."""
i5dk1p,A game where you get to create your own ability,"This is a game idea i got from watching hunterxhunter (hxh), which is an anime/manga. In hxh the ""magic"" system of hxh is called nen and im going to simplify nen but there are 6 different classes. Each nen class boosts the power of your specific class. For example the enhancement class makes it so that you can strengthen objects and yourself. The Conjuration class makes it so that you can create objects.     While a enhancer can still create objects just as an conjurer can strengthen objects. Using nen you can create any ability as long as another class can do it, all except for one class the specialist class which has a unique effect for example predicting the future. Sorry for the poor explanation, if you wanna know more or just google hxh nen, but that´s all you need to know for now. \n\nSo the idea for the game is kinda like hxh where you have different classes and you get to create your own ability. Now ill be honest this is where i got stuck because i don´t know how this would work inside a video game. But if i were to imagine it, it would work like, the, create your own class from call of duty. In Cod:B02 you have 10 points and you can create a arsenal of perks, guns etc. until the points run out. So the idea is that in the game you have all of these abilities that already exist and you can put points into healing, damage, size of the ability, strength etc. and you can select for example gravity which would just as an example cost 2 points out of 9 and then maybe you combine the gravity ability with a grenade which would cost 1 point so when the grenade explodes you can select whether you want the grenade to push or pull when it explodes 1 more point. So maybe you want the ability to pull so you select pull. So maybe you select another ability which would cost 2 more points, lets say fire and for that fire to do damage you put points into damage and for the pull to be strong you put the remaining points into strength. So now you have a grenade that when i explodes will pull anything that is close to it and then at the center of the grenade is a burning fire that will burn you. I feel like the possibilities are endless and that i think is the problem, because i don´t know how to put a limit to what you can do with the abilities. Because i imagined that this would either be a game where you fight bosses or a 1v1 pvp game. So i don´t know how to make the game balanced so that you can play against another player if i were to make it into a pvp game. I also don´t know how to make the game just right so that in a game where you fight bosses the bosses don´t become to easy or to hard. \n\nSo the second imaginary option that i scrapped after thinking about this idea is that, so in hxh to activate your ability and to make it stronger you have to put certain restrictions on the ability. So maybe for example you can become immortal for like 15 seconds but your hp falls to 1. So the restriction for that ability is your hp falls to 1 and you can activate it whenever you want, but, it has a long cool down so you cant spam it. Maybe also you cant deactivate it while you are using it to save on invincibility seconds. So once you use it, its been used and you have to wait for the cool down to use it again. But i don´t know how to make this version plausible within a video game format at all because im letting people create whatever ability they want. Maybe a mix of these two options could work. \n\nSome backstory about me, i am 21 and at the age of 19 i was diagnosed with schizophrenia. So for the past two years ive just been stuck at home. I don´t want to share too much but because eventually my parents will die and i can´t go back too school or get a job due to lack of being able to focus and anxiety (and more reasons i just don´t want to overshare). So i thought about what i can do to make some money and video game developer came too mind, i have always played video games and for the past 2 months ive been trying to become a video game developer. I think this project is too big for me to do as a solo developer and a new one at that. So ive decided to post it here, because i do want someone to make a game like this even though i explained it imo very poorly because i dont really have a vision of how it would work. Now i used to think that this game would make me into a millionaire if i made it, but after playing around with the idea in my head i don´t think it would. However i do think that this game would be genre defining, because i googled on it and there doesn't seem to be a game like this. Maybe this game isn't even plausible, i don´t know. But if you do plan to make a game like this good luck. I might make a game like this but it wouldn't be anytime soon."
i5d7es,Anything to recommend?,"Anything 2D, single player without any complex need for enemy AI?"
i55slt,Robin Hood,"Robin Hood is a popular character in historical based fiction, and one that is fairly popular to reimagine and reference. So I what I would like is for a Robin Hood based game that takes inspiration from Assassin's Creed, Thief and other stealth focused games of course. Though open combat should be an option as well. \nPerhaps introduce the Merry Men system or have the ability to play as them and they have different abilities and skills.\n\nClimbing through trees and towns will of course be a thing and perhaps have a wanted system and disguise system as well. Honestly it can be pretty open I am just spit balling here.\nThe last Robin Hood game was made in 2001 I believe."

i50dio,Looking for Couch party game ideas,"I'd like to make my first little couch party game but I'm completely out of ideas.\nThere is one unique concept I'm thinking with, which is that the game will be controlled by your phone instead of a regular controller, which makes it a bit more difficult - however I'd appreciate any idea."
i4xqdm,Dinosaur Survival Game,"So I was playing The Isle, and I was just walking around doing regular things and I thought it would be really cool if The Isle had a system similar to a game I played years ago on Roblox of all places. The game is called Dinosaur Simulator and rightfully so, it features Dinosaurs of course and the ability to   \n select and grow one of the starting dinosaurs of your choice. Now you'd grow your dinosaurs and gain a currency called DNA that you'd get from each in-game day and the more days you had on that dinosaur the more currency you'd get each day and the maximum you'd be able to get from each day was 75. Now with this currency you'd be able to buy cosmetic skins, and even more dinosaurs from the shop. You'd also be able to buy Eggs which had a chance to give you more cosmetic skins like golden skins for certain dinosaurs. And once you have a dinosaur that you're satisfied with you would be able to select that dinosaur and click play, and you'd be able to grow that dinosaur from baby, to teen, then adult, and finally elder which is the final stage. And your stats increase bit by bit while you grow instead of The Isle's instant gain more bite-force and health. And there is also a trading system where you would be able to trade skins, and these 2 limited dinosaurs called Megavore (not sure what it's based off of) and Albino Terror (which is based off of Jurassic World'd Indominus Rex). Now I personally feel that this is a poor choice made by the Developer of the game, but then again it is Roblox, which is ultimately pay-to-win and designed for children to get their parents to buy them clothes and things inside of the website. But I do feel that this game was for sure a good play, and there's not a game out there like this and I think if it could be designed by an experienced developer and or company then it could for sure be a worthy opponent to some of the companies out there today that attempt to make a Survival Dinosaur type game. Here is the game's link if you want to experience it for yourself  [https://www.roblox.com/games/228181322/Dinosaur-Simulator?refPageId=505bfc3b-75e5-417d-808e-005aa2d01079](https://www.roblox.com/games/228181322/Dinosaur-Simulator?refPageId=505bfc3b-75e5-417d-808e-005aa2d01079)"
i4uyjq,Super Mario Galactic Odyssey - A sequel to both Galaxy and Odyssey,"There have been growing nostalgia toward the Super Mario Galaxy series and demand for Galaxy 3 in the fandom. No Mario game feels like Galaxy games. Super Mario Galaxy was the first game to introduce the course-based type in the 3D Mario game. These games have clear objectives and linear progression for their goals. This does not mean the games are not 3D. Mario is still moving in a 3D space. He's just constricted to a course with limited exploration and freedom. \n\nSuper Mario Odyssey was a return to Mario 64 style Open Field type of Mario games. The player can tackle multiple objectives within a world and the level design is more open-ended to encourage exploration and freedom in the traversal. It seems Nintendo has set this as a new direction for the franchise.\n\nHere is the pitch. What about both? Super Mario Galactic Odyssey serves as a sequel for Galaxy and Odyssey, mixing elements of both games.\n\nThe game features Odyssey style openworld collecthathon exploration but set in space, truly capturing massiveness of space. The player can travel in space freely, looking for planets. Each planet serves as a Galaxy style course-based level with gravity mechanics, which are now enhanced by the complex move-set of Odyssey. Some planets are hubworlds like Earth. There is a quest system in which the player can meet many different characters on planets and do a series of side quests for moons. Some items can alter how the player travel around the space such as changing gravity.\n\nI think this could serve as a nice bridge between Galaxy fans and Odyssey fans."
i4s3vd,Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein RPG,"I was thinking that it could be interesting to make an open-world RPG based on the book version of Frankenstein. It would be based in a gothic style world where you’d play as the Creature. The game would start off by allowing you (through Dr. Victor Frankenstein) to create the Creature. This could give an excuse for both the customizable appearance of the Creature as well as the distribution of stats (like Strength, Intelligence, etc). Once you were out in the world, you would most likely have the end goal of finding Dr. Frankenstein again and, in between, wander around through villages and perform side quests. Leveling up could be done with the idea that the Creature is upgrading itself and you could easily fit in alternate paths and choices for ways to complete the story, missions, and side quests."
i4n623,"A Game Idea Which Sounds Cool, But I Can't Make","so it's a first-person hero shooter and its set at about 2035.

WW2 era styled planes, functioning radar but looks like the Marauder's Map from Harry Potter, little printing scroll reads off your fuel, oil, temp readings... flight suit is something like this Warhammer 40K thing I found [here](https://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/Throne_Mechanicum).  Changing your ship loadout to stake weapons when fighting the vampire counts, things like this.\n\nAnother thought would be a more high fantasy angle with you taking down giants, massive golems, harpies, witches, dragons, orc air raids, etc. You could use the 'magic' of this for some fun options with craft customization like adding fireball or lighting weapon options, blink, shields, etc and doing a more gamey system.\n\nLast thought would be a space opera sci-fi style. See the first 30 seconds of this [Starcraft 2 Cinematic for inspiration](https://youtu.be/MVbeoSPqRs4?t=20). This would allow for greater ship customization options within the game world while being more realistic and less arcadey. I lean more towards sci-fi usually.  \n\nI'm putting together how this would work mechanically and having a bit of trouble collection my thoughts there. If you're sent in as a strike team to fight off a few giants assault a town what does the pilot have to fear? Do the giants have the aid of support air-to-air combatants and what would those be? Maybe incorporate weak points and having to trip up and disable their weapons is more important than just killing the enemy, How do you do air to air combat when you are fighting a winged creature? They would need to be some combination of as nimble, and fast as you are to make it dangerous and make sense right?\n\nPlease let me know your thoughts. I will continue to edit and expand this idea. Oh and one other note.. I think this should be best done as a game where you are locked in to your 1st person perspective rather than having six camera angles to jump between. This will magnify the size of the creatures you're fighting and really lock in the perspective of the ongoing battle without making everything feel limp as soon as you switch to the 3rd person view."

i47sms,[Vigilante 101] A Full on Open Universe Hero RPG.,"\n\nA game all about creating your own hero, doing the ordinary missions, and gaining or losing public favor. Becoming a “hero” or a “villain” in the process. But there is a small twist, we will talk about that down the line.\n\nIn the game, there is a machine that is tied to the main story-line. It is about a Multi-verse theorem. And the main antagonist basically collects his “reflections” that became just like him from other timelines for his own personal benefits (solving a family tragedy etc.). \n\nIt is a full-on RPG, where you select your gear and get to choose from 3 power classes.\n\nTactical: You are pretty much Batman/Green Arrow type of a hero. Where your gadgets save or break you. You can use stealth to your advantage and can comıfulage. Also, you can drive your own custom vehicles. Car/Motorcycle.\n\nUbermensch: You are like Superman. All-Mighty and powerful. But It is easy to cause havoc with this class because you have basically unlimited power you can seriously hurt the people/city while you brawl with the baddies. \n\nAlso, you get affected by this universe’s version of a “glowing rock” in many encounters.\n\nYou can fly, you can destroy buildings, you are a titan.\n\nAffected: Your power comes from an ancient tech/spell or it comes from a distant alien lifeform. \n\nYou have the powers of Shazam! Or Green Lantern to an extent. \n\nYou can fly, and you are super powerful, but your powers need to recharge. If it drains juice in combat, you are screwed.\n\nNow for the small twist. In the end-game, you defeat or join forces with the evil regime. But both outcome ends with the machine malfunctioning and opening several rifts into other realities. \n\nWith that, you can join another player’s earth. You can be a foe or a hero in their own playgrounds. So even when the game ends, It kinda becomes a fort-defense type of thing. \n\nEvery player can decorate their own world while playing the game so, there would be enough variety and new environments to explore. \n\nWhat do you think?"

i43jlu,"DOOM, except it’s played only with the Super Shotgun","You all know DOOM. The classic game that gave birth to the FPS genre. I’ve been thinking about making a game similar to it since I absolutely love the mechanics. Unfortunately, that would just be copying if I didn’t do something different.\n\nSo, the game is only played with one weapon, the Super Shotgun. I choose this weapon because of how satisfying it is to use; only 1 or 2 shots, but still packs a punch.\n\nTo add variety, there are 4 types of ammo: standard, grenade, slug, and vortex. Standard shells act like your regular pellet shots. Grenade shells launch explosive projectiles. Slug shells are used for precision targeting, and vortex launches an energy orb that stuns and electrifies enemies it passes through.\n\nThe shotgun can also have upgrades installed. Standard shells have a tighter spread when aiming down sights; grenades can be detonated on command; slugs now have zoom and don’t suffer damage drop off; vortex orbs basically become the BFG-9000 except it only stuns enemies.\n\nEach enemy would also have some kind of defense mechanism that can only be disabled by a specific ammo. Grenades are used to stagger enemies; slugs hit critical spots; vortex disabled energy shields.\n\n**TL;DR:** I just want to play DOOM but only with the Super Shotgun"

i3zskg,A Grand List of Ideas / Suggestions that could Revolutionise Minecraft Forever!,"Minecraft Idea and Suggestion List:\n\nMinecraft is one of the greatest games ever made. The limits are boundless. The imagination and creativity used in this game are second to none, and yet still, something feels vastley empty upon this fantastic game.\n\nIn survival mode, you are to survive as long as you can while mining for resources and crafting items to aid this. You Battle enemies that spawn at night and kill passive mobs for food. You are tasked with doing many things that are aimed as goals for the game. These include acquiring the highest Tier of armour and weapons, as well as travelling to the recently updated Nether and then the End, to face off with the Ender Dragon, the main antagonist of Minecraft. But if you still want something else to battle created by your own hand you can summon the wither, the secondary boss and antagonist of Minecraft to battle as well.\n\nThe game thus far has evolved. With more realistic updates like the aquatic and more fantastic and adventurous updates like the Nether update, we can expect a lot more to come.\n\nNow this is not, what I am sure has been mentioned multiple times, petty fixes or updates to much pre-existing things or complex code related update based on more acurrate or newly designed random generation update. This is, what I hope to appear to be, different.\n\nThis is a tactical long term idea to gradually persue based on what could have people spend more time on Minecraft, with more detailed and straightforward ideas rather than vauge ones that are used with random results and unexpected complexes.\n\nMy first suggestion / idea for Minecraft is one probably most key to what I mentioned in the previous paragraph. Minecraft can sometime feel a little empty. The process/path to killing the ender dragon is one of straight forward, with things to do along the way. Now all of these ideas that I list will most likely interconnected, but may be able to be pulled off individually. To help understand some of the suggestions,\n\nI will have to show other uses of this idea in other games.\n\nFor my first: An extended world full of more imaginative biomes. After the Nether update, the idea came to me to have something that would help Minecraft even further as a whole rather than a part of the game. More biomes would give the player more exploration time and more wonders to awe at. The world map can look a little plain sometimes, being just grass, sand, red sand and sea, with little other features. It feels a bit plain, especially how they mirror what biomes we have in real life. We could use more biome like the crimson forrest: original, beautiful to look at, and unique to Minecraft. A game which as mastered this is Terraria, which recently met its final update, and has a grand collection of biomes with different made up themes. \n\nMy second Idea / suggestion is kind of an extention of the previous one: more mobs, and animals (Including one's that come at day). So, (kinda) breaking a tradition here is some harder mobs spawn at the day in harder biomes. And mobs that don't follow the rules or limitations of normal mobs. This minecraft has been doing, but on a smaller scale and one at a time. We should introduce mobs that require certain weapons or special conditions to damage or kill it, making it so not any normal player can kill this.\n\nMy third idea contradicts what may be my most effective contribution to what Minecraft can feel a little plain. My Idea - more things the player can do. Now I know I promised not to be vague, but this can come in any form of way. In the game, we can mine, place blocks, craft, glide, fly, shoot, even swim, and many more, but there is still a lot the player can't do. This can come under a few catagories, mainly the things that allow smoother movement and control, and abilities the player is able to tap into, like grappling, or swinging, however the more movement based version can be like double jumps, or a speed boost. Mainly, I would suggest abilites that the player can do rather than the control of the player. Make there be more things you can do in the game that can help players. \n\nMy fourth idea is definetly my most AMBITIOUS one yet. This is something that comes above all others at this point, which says something. This would be able to single handedly fix the emptyness of Minecraft. No longer the plain game, rather the more live looking.\n\nNow, my idea is filling the world with structures and mass structures like the following. Something to fill the world, make it seem alive.\n\nCastles - a place you can only access while wearing Iron armour while holding a banner customised to the Knights logo; inside you can find Knights and baron squires, who fight off mobs and are good to interact with\n\nA Rebooted Dungeon - we already have Dungeons in Minecraft (not referencing the seperate game), which are stone enclosures with a monster spawn of zombies. We could have this rebooted into a dungeon like the one of the spin off Game - just not too similar, or crazy. Just like the stronghold, but bigger, with more NCPs in the style of Minecraft Dungeons characters who can assist you with currency. Like the original Dungeons, these also hold a lot of loot, but guarded accordingly. \n\nSky Cities - That's right! I really want this to happen! And I am not the only one! There should be an item - like a jetpack or just an upgraded Elytra - to allow you to access the sky plane, where there are cloud islands that are full of fantasy mobs and loot in the sky. You cannot use blocks to get up here - as if you go past the barrier to the sky planes without the jetpack/elydrea equipped - you would die instantly. \n\nCITIES - The one you should add the most! Although it can be made by the public if on a massive online server, it would be nice to see an authentic cites by mojang, based on the one of the cities and city structures in the \n\n2011 - 2018 tutorial world (Rip). This could introduce townsfolk, more authentic looking people who look like the players, in the same style of Steve and Alex. They could be a more advanced vilkiger used for different purposes like quests which ends in fair rewards.\n\nMy Fith Idea / Suggestion is very well linked to the past one and I feel is almost as important - wondering NCP scattered around the world. Wether in houses in Villages or Cities or hunting in caves or even fighting in dungeons when playing local multilayer or even live multilayer it is always reassuring to see NCP to help when you're lost.\n\nThe two previous ideas combined is what Minecraft should aim for. Scatter the lands with NCPs and give loads of structures and locations to visit while also (obviously) giving the player enough room to build and develop their own villigees.\n\nNow I'm not asking to turn Minecraft into a Triple A RPG game with this, it just gives more life to the world. And wandering through the same old biomes at day can be really dull and boring especially when lost and kind of seems plain, pointless, and uneventful.\n\nMy Sixth Idea / Suggestion is: Mini-Bosses and events. \n\nAfter playing the first 15 consecutive nights in the game events trigger, lasting sometimes a whole day, and occur every 3-6 days. They summon bosses, with minions to defeat. When the boss is defeated along with the minions it would end the event and give the player a reward. If the event ends before the player slays the boss, the boss would departure giving no reward. \n\nThe Events are often themed, with the bosses and minions following the theme. The theme could be fire, ice, or even redstone! This would prove something to give the player a challenge if they want to battle something other than mid-night mobs.\n\nMy seventh idea, which I think is one of the coolest, is spells! \n\nThis is something small I could see Mojang trying to incorporate. Spells can be simple - but deadly as you use different materials (some borrowed from brewing) to craft element based spells which can for instence act as an enhanced an infinite fire charge, or like a water spell that acts like a water gun. Even a lightning spell Could commence. \n\nTo give more understanding to this - think of a game called Portal Knights (If you have ever played it). That game utilises spells as a secondary weapon, which can be used using mana. This would be the perfect addition to Minecraft to finally tie the knot with the arts of witchcraft and wizardry. \n\nMy Eighth and Final Idea / suggestion is a popular and probably common one - more Armour and weapon sets (but with different and key attributes) \n\nRemember when everyone said gold was useless, so mojang made hold relevent in the Nether update? What if we could do that and go beyond this with new armour sets. \n\nAgain, I am sorry to compare this with Terraria, but Terraria has a wide range and variety of armour and weapon sets designed with a key purpose for each one.\n\nIn Minecraft, we could have a system similar to this, but more advanced - armour that allows you to swim in lava, gives fire resistance 24/7 and even leaves a fire trail - while anything aquatic damages it... And vis versa.\n\nThis could certainly be used to cross certain biomes that maybe you can't survive without the suits, like a fire biome, or a poisoned biome. This would also heavily improve pvp, as given certain armour sets certain weaknesses to other elements would revolutionise Minecraft! Peopem would play solely for PvP!\n\nNow I know you're wondering why I can't have some modder do this for me, or why I care so much about what could help people invest or reinvest into Minecraft, or why I wrote this mega-essay about this, and it all leads to the same conclusion...\n\nMinecraft is a key part of my childhood, as gaming always has been. It is for many children across the world an imaginative ms da crwtive game which crafted a defining moment in their lives. It Brough families and people together and embraced what not a lot of games had in 2009 - creativity. And still does to this day!\n\nI just want Minecraft to be the best it can be, not just for me, but for everyone! I think this should be an official part of the game because I want my ideas to be shared and to be enjoyed by all, and I hope that this gains the attention of not just the officials, but the fans, giving hope to Minecraft!"

im3v21,Horror Game Ideas," \n\nAs soon as i learn how to get my ideas made, im gonna turn this particular idea into a horror game, take a look\n\n""About a year after the loss of their oldest son, the Leotson family has almost completely let go of the pain that came with his suicide. However, that son hasnt gotten over the pain they made him feel, and is now quite vengeful towards the family, and he's back to hurt them worse then they ever hurt him....""\n\nIt plays alot like Until Dawn, with multiple characters to switch between, and the fact they could live or die depending on the player's actions. Theres also a different way he wants each of the family members to suffer, and they will have to confront there demons, and own up to things..... Unlike Until Dawn, each of the characters are generally isolated from eachother. Its in the style of a Horror RPG like Mad Father or Ao Oni, and it also involves trying to avoid Will's ghost, or find his weaknesses. Weaknesses are generally two things, Memory items, which are items he cherished in life, or, if your playing with one of the few characters he doesnt truly hate and is more just upset with, reminding him of better times, which is when we see a bit of humanity come out of him."

im229z,Design your own post-apocalypse,"A strategy or tactical-management game in which you can generate a wide range of post-apocalpytic scenarios based on user input. \n\nYou start by tweaking variables for a world map. Want a world devastated by atomic war? Increase the slider for radioactivity. Want Kevin Costners water world? Increase the percentage of ocean cover. Any specific dangers roaming the world that are not a ""faction""? Add hostile creatures and set how commonly they occur (zombies being just one example). Or instead chose a prefab setting and finetune it to your desires. Adjust temperature, rainfall, flora, fauna, possibly phatogenes, unique quirks like a world without guns or where everyone wears clown makeup.\n\nNext are the factions, races or whatever you want to call them. You start out with a couple of archetypes that we often see in post-apocalyptic games, like regular people, also called settlers, raiders, military types, cults, mutants and more. Each archetype has a unique gamestyle. Settlers for example will have to balance drafting their citizens and putting them to work in the fields. Raiders can enslave others and eat people with little repercussion. The military types receive resources by completing tasks for their HQ instead of farming/scavenging themselves. The cult is about making the people of other factions unhappy and they can utilize special ""magic"" powers depening on what kind of apocalyptic world you're set in. Mutants encompass everything non-human and rely a lot on modifaction by traits. Every archetype can then be refined with a selection of positive and negative traits that turn them into a concrete and unique faction. The goal is being able to recreate most pop-culture factions, for example from the Fallout series.\n\nI haven't thought much further beyond that. Gameplay would prolly be a strategy game similar to Civ, Age of Wonders or Stellaris. Civ in terms of world generation, Age of Wonders how rpg elements are mixed with grand-strategy and Stellaris for the race creation (but also the wonderful story events).\n\nLet me know your thoughts."
ilzrhl,LARP Online Multiplayer Game,"Given COVID-19 times, LARPing is something that seems at risk of going away or needing to evolve. Some Video games have huge RP communities, but a dedicated tool/game for RP might be very useful. \n\nSpecifically I’m thinking of World of Darkness LARP where there is a focus on building a community and it uses pretty simple mechanics to keep the level of entry low. \n\nFor instance, rock/paper/scissors is a lot easier to deal with from a programming and gameplay perspective than worrying about DPS and cooldowns. \n\nThis simplicity allows for players to look at the system as a tool for socializing and intrigue as opposed to “just a game”.\n\nIt would have to have a robust level/game editor as well. That could easily allow for collaboration across multiple storytellers/game masters. Probably would need Git support or something."

ilnae5,Black clover game idea,"This game would be a moba but different. (this would be a pc only game unless you go for a smite or paragon styled game)\n\nThere would be 3 game modes:  \n1st - normal moba style game, with 3 lanes and a jungle.  \n2nd - would be called squad wars and it would be 3v3v3v3 with 3 lanes in a + shape. with 1  base to prtect and multiple towers.   \n3rd - would be special. it would start as a big battle arena with alot of players in it. You would battle to knock players out (unconscious). after most players are unconscious the squad capitains will choose 1 player out of them all and they will fight and who ever wins that fight wins the game.\n\nThe characters would be the same as normal mobas. 1 passive, 3 normal abilities and 1 ultimate ability. But at some points if you get to a certain level you can change your abilities out for a stronger ability. some characters wont have this tho. \n\nExample character - Asta:  \nPassive - no magic: doesnt need mana to cast abilities  \nAbility 1 - bull trust: Dashes forward dealing damage to any enemy in its path and nullifying any magic casted infront of the blade.  \nAbility 2 - black hurricane - Dashes forward dealing damage to any enemy in his path, it also nullify 1 magic spell if he does nullify he is interupted for 1 second.  \nAbility 3 - Black slash: Creates a big slash that deals damage to any enemy it comes in contact with.  \nUltimate - black demon form: he gains a movement speed buff and a large damage increase for 10 seconds but after would be slowed.  \nIf ability 1 is maxed it can be changed to - black meteorite: Target to an enemy and dash to then dealing major damage and silencing them for 3 seconds.   \nIf Ultimate is maxed can change to - Black rage: Increases damage, movement speed, and gives damage reduction to all magic spells. \n\nIf you have questions just ask if you want to add to this go ahead i would love to hear it."

il3i4o,Guidance in horror games - need ideas,"Hey there. Currently doing a personal 3D first person horror project in Unity. I have a few general questions in regard to how players are typically (indirectly) told where to go. Say we're in a house that belongs to the character that the player is in control of. What could happen that guides the player towards that or something else? For instance, phones ringing, things falling down, etc..\n\nAnother question. I want my game to have interactables (paintings, notes, etc.) that tell a story, but why would the protagonist suddenly, at this very night, interact with that stuff, when he's had years to do that? It would be background scenery for him, so I can't find an actual incentive for him to interact with it."

il32k6,"So I have a great idea for a Chunibyo game. The gang is somehow put in a world where there Chuni powers are real and Touka is like the main boss. You would fight clones of Touka and dark beasts. You get to play as Rikka, Yuuta, Deko, Nibutani, and Kumin while Shichimiya could be DLC.",

ikxrrl,Presidents vs zombies,"A 4 player co op horde survival game with all 45 US presidents being unlockable playable characters.\n\nEach president has a unique late game weapon and special passive, offensive or defensive abilities. For example trumps ability would be “border wall” basically a barrier, where as Obama ability would be “obamacaring” which heals all the presidents. An example of unique weapons would be nixons “hippie blaster”.\n\nEach map will be set in different time periods and will use weapons from the era, the player can still get modern/past weapons from time rift shops on each map. Each map will have special zombies and a boss.\n\nSome Maps I’ve came up with:\n\nWhite House 2020\nBunker hill 1775\nPentagon 1962 \nAir Force one 1997"

ikwy3z,Need a game mechanic idea!,Hello people. I am making a 2d platformer but I dont have a mechanic that is that interesting\n Hit me with whatever you got and whoever's I pick gets credit (yay).
ikv5gi,What's your opinion on this game vid just started developing?,"You are playing as Jakun Mayok\n\nYou are a Japanese boy who was recently expelled from a past school for being violent and a vandal. You had a hard upbringing with your dad being an alcoholic mess and your mother being unstable. You join a new school named Miyako High and there is two Rival Gangs in school one named Naronic and Titan\n When you first enter your new school you get to pick which gang you want to join. After this you get missions for you and your gang to complete such as: murder,kidnap,robbery,Witchcraft and much more offenses. The game will have weekly missions ( in game time) and the game lasts for 12 months ( in game time) You also get alot of side quests and personal things Jakun will have to deal with. The game is being made in Unreal Engine 4 and fully by myself with no community or support. It is inspired by a mix of  Gta  and Hitman and Yandere Simulator and Persona and some gore like Mortal Kombat. What is your thoughts and opinions or ways you want to support or make a community for this. The game is named Gang Activity."
iku4z7,Anyone have any ideas for this?,So I have been playing Fall Guys recently and before I even heard about it I wanted to make a game like that where there were different random levels and a last standing kind of thing where it was kind of the same character movement etc... but now that Fall Guys is a thing I’m not sure what I should make so does anyone have any good ideas of a game kind of like it that will be fun and give off the same affect of exciting and not wanting to stop until you win kind of thing?

ikoqs9,RPG Royale in the fog,"A multiplayer party game with about 100 players.\n\nA random generated map featuring rivers, cliffs, forests and some dark rocky areas. All players spawn anywhere. Now...in third person action..each player can freely walk around and explore the map, it is filled with randomly spawning monsters/chests and other stuff. You can try to kill monsters to gain XP, once your HP is down you die and lose the game, no matter if killed by a monster or another player.\n\nYour goal: Battle Royale, be the last man standing! \n\nThe clue: It's super foggy and you can only see like 20 meters around you. You carry a blue crystal stone that glows brighter and brighter that closer you are to the next player!\n\nThere are features like placing mines, upgrade your armor and find new weapons. XP will bring you more AP after some time.\n\nLike a little hide and seek with extra features!"
ikj6ur,Dream world 2d platformer,"New idea\n\nI have been watching some Dreamscaper gameplay here and there and it reminded me of an idea I had previously. Imagine a plot where a normal high schooler has a pretty bad family life. Like the mother is the one always there and the dad is always working etc.. The MC has no friends and in the real world it's always gloomy colors and such. In the real world people think you're useless and looked down on, Your parents are arguing because of how bad your grades are etc... In the real world you always have a set routine.\n\n**like waking up -&gt; eating breakfast -&gt; going to school -&gt; coming back home.**\n\n  \nBut when you sleep at night you go into a completely different world, like a dream world and you meet all these different species and go to different towns, gain all kinds of powers and help people etc.. During the dream you'll have to face bosses that you couldnt face in real life like for example there might have been a bully irl but reflected like a monster in the dream and stuff. so its like real life is reflected in the dream world but in the dream world you have powers. Maybe at the end there could be a situation where the mother divorces the father and everything goes crazy. \n\n**In the dream world the possibilities can be endless and you are not limited to a certain routine.**\n\nSome similar games to this are \n\n\- Night in the woods  \n\- Dreamscaper   \n\- Persona (the whole school life and other world concept)\n\nSo yeah lemmi know if this is a good concept or not, or if a more similar kind of game already exists."
ikgig3,Need help coming up with the next step of my game.,"Right now I am working on a game that is a simple platformer with all the regular elements of one (spikes that kill you, bottomless pits) and I am at the stage of having a lot of mechanics down but no idea what I'm going to make.\n\nMy original idea was to make a game where you played as a small white cube that completed puzzles in the form of platforming levels. You were a bit of computer code created by a much larger computer and by completing these tests you solved you provided the computer with information on how you worked (kindov like portal but 2D and shell is a white cube created by the computer she runs within). It was going to be called 'Proceed to Generation' but now I think that because art is my stronger side of that and coding I want to do something with better visuals.\n\nIf you have any ideas please let me know (still along the line of platformer as I want to keep all the mechanics) or if you like the current idea cause if enough people do I'll keep going with it.\n\nThank you for your time :)"
ikfgaw,Need help with finding something for a game I want to make,"So what happens in the game is it's basically a battle royale (sort of like apex) but at the start of each game the player is assigned a random skill, which is something that the player can do, like climb walls or something. I want to make the skills fun to use and also balanced, does anybody have any ideas for skills? Sorry if this post is phrased weirdly."
ikeyg4,Need help with a title,"Me and my friend need help making up a game name.\n\nHere's the idea:  \nA game where you have to defend your base with tesla coils that you upgrade throughout waves.

ikdoom,True Survival FPS RPG,"Year One of the Apocalypse \n\nA game where you are a lone dude wandering an world slowly turning into a  wasteland, the catch is, you aren’t part of a major story, you simply observe it happen as the game progresses. The world changes rapidly around you, meanwhile you struggle to find food and water. Ammo is super rare and highly guarded, hiding and conversation are your NUMBER ONE way of getting out of sticky situations. \nYou are trying to find a safe place but different colonies are governed by different types of politics and you are forced to make difficult decisions in order to survive, rather, trickery, running, hiding and trap and of course dialogue making are your best ways of navigating situations.\nThe world is rapidly heading into more chaos by the day, and the challenges become more daunting. The goal is to make it to day 400 where the stage is set.\nIn order to address how it changes, it begins with a strange aura comet that topples and destroys most governments and disables the majority of microchip based tech. Then the riots, then the government tries to restore order, the natural disasters start, then the splinters into small people groups, then formations of small townships, then strange things, undead, then monsters, then aliens, then magic. Basically increasing chaos and turmoil finally turning into supernatural events. Meanwhile the protagonist desperately tries to make sense of the change while scraping by for survival"
ikcp1h,A fnaf game but there are burglars instead of monsters,I think it would be interesting if there was a game like fnaf but your in the eyes of a child dealing with robbers but since a small child has a different perception they see them way scarier and they have to wait until their parents wake up and since different perception time is longer and they have to hide from the robbers and a nightmare mode where it happens again in the future but they are more scared because they know the gravity of the situation and its more realistic. They have to hide in different places and keep the doors closed and there would be a home alone mode where they have to fight back the burglars with a little mini game setting up the traps while they're roaming through the house.
ikbmk1,A Chinese Take on Zelda,"This idea has probably been done before but as a girl I've always loved Chinese culture in it's fullest, I thought the idea of a Chinese inspired Zelda game is really interesting so many different ideas to pick from and I wanted to see if anyone could expand on this idea farther than I could, dms open :)"

ik5q1j,A spinoff idea,"Ok, so I read the rules on how to post an idea by Sir_Magic (which is great by the way if not a little condesending) and I'm gonna post something that is not so much a good game idea (but if someone is willing to make it I will make all the assets) but something that I hope will make you chuckle.\n\nThe idea (I'm sorry I dont know how to do bold text I'm new to reddit)\nOk, so you know portal (of course you know portal) anyway it is a game exactly like that but silly called Hole. So you are in a facility run by an evil robot AI and you have a shovel that by hitting certain panels on the walls creates holes (like a melee portal gun) and I've got a bunch of other ideas on how to make it funny if anyone cares but I hope this was a funny thought for you.\n\nI am open to being burnt if you hate the idea :)"
ik4oy3,A third person survival shooter where the enemy is procedurally generated and you can build your own weapons,"Some time in the far future, Earth is overrun by Nanobots that can take over various machines. Enemies are basically thrown together from various appliances, or junk. Some are just toasters spider feet, others are in humanoid shape with car tires for feet and heavy maxhine guns for arms. No enemy is the same. Your task is to survive.\n\nOh, and you can build your own weapons from parts (barrels, magazines, etc.)"
ik2sh0,Sandbox like Medieval Game,"Now at first you might think of various games, the closest in mind being Medieval Engineers. However what I had particularly in mind was a game more like the X series where you can create a army/ takeover areas or build things (instead of star bases maybe build a mine, or start a lumber mill). Obviously the idea is rather vague but then for combat I'd think a system similar to DnD might be good to look at for realism and balancing.   \n\n\nSo in short the big sell points would be:\n\n1. Free-roam-like aspect that is sandbox in nature\n2. Have Mythical Races so that you could be apart of any kind of empire you can think of, or start your own empire.\n3. have parts of the world that are not inhabited so that if you don't want to be social you could build up your own empire on your own land\n4. you can build various things such as mines, lumber mills, blacksmiths, etc to make new products.\n5. have world quests that occur like a dragon appearing or a goblin horde, something within fantasy genre.  \n\n\nI haven't thought it through very much so any additional ideas or opinions on this would be appreciated.   \n\n\nIf someone knows a game like this please let me know as well, as I have been searching for quite a while as of now."
ik18op,Coop shooter where one person plays a dog.,"I have been roaming around GTA Online as a dog lately and just paling around with random people. \n\nIt got me thinking how fun it might be to play as a dog helping a person in a coop game. Im thinking a third person game where you play as a K9 officer. The two would have to work together to solve puzzles and take down bad guys. \n\nIdeally it would be one of those games where if you bought one copy two people could play. Better yet, if you buy the game you can play as a person but it's free to play as a dog (maybe the other way around, the dog sounds more fun to me)."
ik11mi,"not a game developer, just a gamer that likes music driven games with a message","i was thinking that while there are amazing music driven games, the problem i have with them is that they are mostly pretty repetitive and with a puzzle genre to them (like hue or games with that style) \n\nso i was thinking, what about a story/choices game with multiple endings like the telltale games or life is strange with 2 major factors,\n\n 1: a world that changes very subtly the aesthetic depending on the character state of being or simply emotions (for example little by little the world changes to a darker palette or it starts raining when the characters life goes through a tough time or when its mental health decays and brighter colors and sunshine when he is happy) giving a lesson of how mental health changes your perspective about everything in your life\n\nand 2: the music doing the same, depending on the mental state or the emotions of the protagonist, the backround music would change genres, not on specific moments, more like the constant backround music that is lightly heard at all times\n\nthe character can be customisable but that is optional im just a fan of customisation"
ik0plv,Santa Mowing Down Terrorists,"I got this idea for a stupid game, basically it’s a single player game that could also be played in co-op where one person is Santa and another one is Ms.Claus, basically the game starts off at a cutscene where Santa is delivering presents and in the middle of delivering presents he gets shot down by terrorists, the sleigh crashes and Santa quickly hides in the present bag, then the terrorist approaches it and are about to loot it but then suddenly Santa comes out of the present bag with a candy caned colored minigun and that’s when the player starts taking control of Santa and christmas themed dubstep music starts playing as you mow down terrorist with your minigun, I also thought about some of the weapons you can get like the Candy Cane Shank or the Christmas Star RPG.\n\nThat’s all I thought about for the game the rest is up to you or the person who’s probably going to make the game i just really wanted to share my idea of a stupid game"
ijzg17,Intergalactic horse race,"Hey guys,\n\nSo the game is a serie of horse races. You don't control them, but you bid on them before each race. Since humanity as colonised a lot of planets, the horses are somewhat... Specials. Some have wings, others have fire breath, etc. They all have stats that you can access before each run. With the money you gain, you can pay to access to more informations for each racer and type of horses.\n\nIn the midgame you can send teams on other planets to analyse some secrets stats from the horses, or more detailed ones (like the size in this specie give this acceleration, the number of eyeballs this top speed, etc).\n\nThe game end when you finally encounter a ""normal"" horse which everyone bid on.\n\nSome variations could include building your own stable and breeding the horses, but it would be for a bigger game."

The things you destroy gets absorbed. The more you destroy, the bigger you get. You develop monster attributes based on the things you absorb. When you meet another player, you either fight like a fighting game if your sizes are similar,  monster hunter-like, or colossus-like if you're smaller, or godzilla-like if you're bigger. NPCs can either shoot at you or run away. You win when everybody else is dead."
ijuuk1,Games with ML-Agents as a core feature.,"After making several successful kids apps over the years we feel ready to let our small indie studio explore new interesting things.  \n\n\nWe started tinkering with ML-agents, and it's really fun to see it bring little characters to life, so we started discussing ideas with this in mind.  \n\n\nSeveral ideas down the road we started leaning towards this idea:  \nYou play as this little kid in a settlement on a foreign planet. It's up to you to save everyone, and to your aid you have alot of scrap materials. You use these to build robots to help you with assignments such as building constructions, terraforming and helping people with silly requests. \n\nYou play by controlling the kid in a 3D environment, with the ability to give commands to the robots. The issue is that ML robots will fail miserably, and look silly doing so. Part of the game loop is to recollect the scraps and build new better robots. Upgrade them and try again.  \n\n\nWe also think the story arc of someone trying a little too hard and not listening could make for an interesting start in this setting.   \n\n\nIt seems like ML as a core gameplay element could have great potential, we would love to hear your ideas."
ijui9z,Purge Island: The Lawless Battle Royale,"Purge Island is the brand new Battle Royale where everything is allowed, help strangers then betray them for their loot! set ambushes, lose your faith in your fellow man! But that's not all, the island is CRAWLING with zombies, which can be used to your advantage or to your detriment. In the end, only four players can make it to the escape helicopter and leave the island.  \n\n\nGameplay features:\n\nLootable, drivable vehicles: steal an ambulance and get medikits, or a shitgun from a police car.\n\nUse your items on other players: apply a medkit to someone else or manually hand them ammo.\n\nShoot cars to trigger their alarms when enemies are nearby, attracting every zombie around them."
ijqczt,Idea for a court game,I just got this idea for a multiplayer gamer where there’s a criminal who must defend himself in court and a prosecutor who has to prove that he’s guilty. There’s a judge who has to be given evidence from both people and make a decision based on it. \n\nObviously not very well thought through but I think it’s cool.
ijqb6z,Farting Cow,"Environmentalists have warned that cow farts contribute to global warming, due to the release of methane.

If you caught, then it’s game over and off to the hamburger factory!  \n😄"
ijpx2g,A twitch on Divison 2. Maybe a potential mod idea?,"So, I'm a huge fan of the Division series. I love the premise of it, seeing as im a sucker for virtually anything dystopian/post-apoc.\n- And there is a lack of Survival games I truly enjoy.\n\nThe mechanics in Division 2 and erase the monotonous game play loop, add in hunger, thirst and actual settlement building(which kind of alreafy exists) and bingo, you have a solid survival game.\n\n- Diplomacy\nMy ideal set up would to add in 2 additional settlement options.\nYou have a total of 3 in the game, adding 2 more in different locations could provide an interesting turn of events.\n\nThe current 3 existing settlements are:\n- The White House\n- Theater District\n- The Campus\n\nHave buffs for whichever settlement you choose to make yours, and youre only allowed 1.\n- WH provides better diplomacy skills with other setflements.\n- Theater District is roof based, so you gain advanced solar and wind power options and better crop production but the size of them are limited.\n- Campus has better crafting, research and advanced components to allow for more tech to be crafted faster. Provides boost to internal moral due to easy access of recreational activities(gym, library, ect)\n\nYou can ally with up to 2 of the 5 total settlements and each provides a perk or two depending on your alliances.\n\nEach settlement choice and ally choice comes with negatives as well.\nExample: The WH'a draw back is its more frequently targeted for raids and draws more attention which declines morale over time and when the raiders do a lot of damage or have successful raids; but allying with the Campus provides a moral boost effect when they share their facilities with the WH.\n\n- Core Game Play Changes\nAdd in extra wild life roaming the city. There are already stray dogs and deer that roam the city as is. Increase the frequency of them appearing; as well as adding things like wolves and potentually bears(seing as its in DC, i dont know what wild life is there.)\nChange the Safe Houses, Control Points and Strongholds.\n- Safe Houses are for your Agent only. Sort of like a ""Home way from home."" Stash your gear, ect. A place to sleep, and cook your food and maintain your gear ect.\n- Control Points provide a security boost if you control them in the district your in, or boost the NPCs raid frequency and morale boost for the faction thT controls it. Additional change: Resource POIs exist around the map. Make the Resources points controlled by the faction closed to them via control point(used as a resource route that exists in game already).\n- Strong Holds are now in each factions hands. Hyenas, True Sons, and the Looters. You can raid them but they are nigh impenetrable and need to be raided in stages. Weaken outer walls/defenses, push in further and weaken interior defenses and then the third raid is an attempt to take over the Stronghold.\n~ A failed raid resets all progression on the strong hold to stage 1 and makes it harder to raid again.\n~ Waiting too long between raid stages makes the previous stage harder to raid.\n\nThere is a reason I didnt give a strong hold to the Outcasts, and that's because they would control the Dark Zones. They thrive in there and the dark zones act as dungeons almost.\nEach Darkzone has a different threat from the outcasts and their own specialty forces, and the sort of ""Boss"" is pretty difficult to defeat because of the mechanics that would be involved.\n\nExample, one DZ could specialize in the heavy gunners, the suiciders(they literally run at yoy and blow themselves up), and the Heavy melee elites that have the sledge hammers. The suiciders run fast as hell and force you out of cover, the heavy gunners just spray at you from cover and the sledge elites chase after you and have a metric ass ton of armor so its a pretty ferocious dungeon. The boss battle exponentially gets harder with the introduction of the Outcasts Grenadiers.\n\n\nOf course all of this would be repeatable. Successfully raining a stronghold would essentially tier up the entire stronghold over and over again, the DZs would get harder as time goes on, but resets after a while of being left alone.\n\nAll in all, I truly do see potential for this game if these changes were made.\nEvery time I play this game the lighting, atmosphere and beauty just blow me away...but I really wish the game was a tad bit different..\n- Another change would just be astetically and that would he to make the buildings more decayed, run down and over grown."

ijly6c,I can not find a turn based strategy war game. Here is my idea that I would propose to a company.,"I have been looking for a game like this for the longest time, but could never find one similar to this idea. My idea is going to be detailed and mildly long.\n\nThe game I had in mind was a Turn based game kinda like Civilization but it is based on modern combat. Each player spawn on opposite sides of the map. The map scale in perspective it would take 10 to 15 turns to move from corner to corner of the map. The reason why I wanted it so players cant just immediately rush someone off spawn immediately, and to actually secure key villages/ locations. Around the map there are key points to occupy with troops. These points will grant you more cash or spending power for building more troops or vehicles. Such as friendly villages or liberating enemy villages. Key points would be on top of hills, between mountains, over rivers, roadways, etc. Villages you are able to maneuver through the buildings, and using anything for cover. Like Domination game modes in other FPS your team would need to occupy a flag inside the village to secure it and gain bonuses off of it.\n\nNext would be your arsenal that you have at your finger tips. I have not really thought about what would make the game balanced but a more realistic type of units. I will break down each unit, but here is all of the units. Combat Engineer, Infantry, Cavalry, Mortar man, Snipers, Special Forces, Medics, Combat Controllers, and Paratroopers are the individual Soldiers. Next is Vehicles/ Special weapons. Artillery, Tanks, Air Support, Personnel carriers, and Naval Barrage. Next is the break down and each soldiers capabilities. I have not fully thought through each of them, but just a basic idea for them all.\n\nEngineer would be able to create obstacles. These obstacles would be wire obstacles, destroying bridges, building bridges, or placing mines. Engineer units have a special passive scouting ability that allows them to detect enemy mines in the area. They are also able to defuse these mines. ENG can also explode holes in walls, barriers, and or enemy engineer obstacle to allow alternate entrances to buildings or enemy bases. Lastly another passive ability is the ability to dig fox holes faster than other units.\n\nInfantry are just the basic soldier. They have more accuracy and fire power than all of the units besides Special forces units, but infantry units have more units when spawned.\n\nCavalry or CAV Scout are scout units. They are able to detect enemy units further away.\n\nCombat Controllers are units that have the ability to call in air support like napalm strikes, JDAMs, warthogs, and helicopters to attack set targets. These would need a huge cool down for all of them, and would cost more points to use. So either you can build more units with your points or spend more on air support.\n\nSnipers... Shoot far... Also have the ability to disable some vehicles, and have a spotting ability to detect units the farthest. Almost undetectable unless a unit is within close proximity.\n\nMedic heal units\n\nMortar men shoot explosives kinda like artillery. Basically easily moved around\n\nSpecial Forces. These are obviously the best unit to an extent. They can easily be over run if the enemy has more numbers. These units would spawn with only 5. In the group of five it will have ENG abilities, CAVs, and Medics. They would have the best accuracy.\n\nVehicles im not gonna go crazy on but basically tanks, hummvs, and so on.\n\nNow into the mechanics for units. You would spawn with 3 platoons (45 soldiers) of Infantry, 1 platoon of ENG (15 soldiers), 2 Cav Squad (5 soldiers), and 4 individual medics. Each unit is moved as a group, but can be split off into however many soldiers you want split. Once split you are able to move individual units to cover, or have them dig fox holes to protect a location. If a your units run into a instance where you walk up on a enemy fox hole your units will automatically find the nearest cover, but most likely your units are going to take some damage. For building or placing obstacles it takes a few turns to actually construct whatever you are trying to build. Units would have a set speed, accuracy, and armor depending on the unit. Guns would also have set stats like ROF, ACC, and DMG.\n\nCustomization in the main menu. I am going to use Infantry for explanation. Each platoon will have a set amount of machine gunners, grenadiers, and rifleman. In which you can customize if you gunners run the 249, or a 240. 249 has less damage but a high ROF, and the 240 has more damage and range but needs a rifleman's assistance operating the weapon. Grenadiers have the option to run explosive rounds, smoke, or incendiary. And rifle man can unlock different kinds of rifles, and they would all be balanced the best they could. You could also have the ability to make uniforms for your soldiers, and specialized uniforms for your special forces units. Like if you want you Spec forces guys wearing Taliban looking attire that is fine, or if you want him shirtless with a vest, helmets, boots, and a pair of pink short shorts go ahead.\n\nIf you made it this far thanks for reading this. If you could just put your input in the comment section. I want to see who else would be interested in this type of game. If someone could put me in contact with someone to possibly make this game a reality that would be awesome to. This game would be RAW strategy. I have a lot more ideas for it, but I am not going to go on any further with this post.\n\nThank You!"
ijlpf9,Sony should make PlayStation 4 Portable as a continuation of PSP and Vita to compete Nintendo Switch,"Since Nintendo has dominated the portable market with Switch, which is meant to offer handheld AAA games, I thought about Sony doing the same thing but with PS4.\n\nCall it PlayStation 4 Portable, PS4P. About the size of Switch, maybe slightly bigger. The technology of the Base PS4. You can put PS4 disks and play PS4 games on the go. It immediately resolves the problem of the lack of launch titles Vita suffered since most people would already have PS4 games. I suspect the technology is already there although the price will be a concerning factor."
ijiqjj,Give me your most stupid mobile game ideas,I'm going to be on a train for 24h and want a simple yet stupid mobile game idea\n\nWhat are your most stupid ideas that you would actually play? :D
ijdac4,Glass of water game,"I've got a neato idea. An mmo of sorts where you all play as glasses of water. How filled up you are could be both heath and resource. You use your innate control of your fluids to heal or deal damage by flinging your water at your target. Healing fills you back up and dealing damage causes you to spill, damage over time could be causing a crack that slowly drains your fluids. You could have skins that make you into different beverages like orange juice or soda, or maybe this could be a class system. Where sodas deal more damage with their carbonation or poison with unhealthy sugars. Things like milk could heal with their vitamins and soothing consistency. This could be a pretty new and fun idea."
ij9x3t,[ Card Games ] Minimalism and Zen Garden,"**Minimalism**\n\nEvery Turn, a Player can Draw a Card into their Hand, or Play a Card from their Hand. You MUST do one of the two options, and cannot pass your turn. \n\nLike UNO, Minimalism is about getting rid of Cards in your Hand. Except, getting rid of ALL the Cards in your Hand loses you the game. Winning means having the Greatest Average Value of Cards ( Total Value of Cards in Hand / Number of Cards in Hand ) when the Deck runs out. \n\nEach Card has varying Values, and you'd want to keep the more valuable Cards in your Hand, playing as many of the less valuable Cards as possible. However, each Card has an ability, with higher Value Cards having more powerful, helpful abilities, while lower Value Cards are only good in certain situations or might even negatively affect you. \n\nThis means that there is both a pro and con for keeping higher *and* lower value cards. The aim is to balance out the strengths and weaknesses of each card in your particular situation and discard the least helpful, hoping to simulate the real life pain of decluttering. Nothing is easy to get rid of, but some are easier than others, and which ones vary on your situation.\n\n**Zen Garden**\n\nThis is a simple drafting game, where ( Number of Players + 1 ) Cards are drawn and passed around, with each player taking turns to choose one ( clockwise ), and the privilege of being the first to choose passed around the table ( anti-clockwise ). The next player will not know which card the previous player(s) has chosen. Leftover card(s) are discarded in the middle.\n\nEach card has a value, but it is worth pitifully little compared to ""Formations""; sets of cards that are worth much more as a whole than it's individual parts. These are based on real Zen formations like ""Buddha and his Attendants"" and ""Mount. Horai / Mount. Penglai"". \n\nWhoever's garden has the most value wins. There are also 8 character cards with varying abilities to help themselves ( but not hinder others directly ). What differentiates this game from others like Sushi Go, is the philosophy this game is based on: the Japanese concept of wabi-sabi; imperfection, impermanence and the emphasis of what isn't there.\n\nYou can have up to 9 cards in your garden, but you don't have to. You can pass on cards during your turn. Why? Because like how sets of cards form formations that give you points, they can also form violations ( temporary name ) that cost you lots of points ( and probably the game ). The more cards you have, the higher the chance of making a violation. \n\nOnce you choose a card to put into your garden, it's stuck there forever\*. It might be better to not play at all. The game ends when the deck runs out ( 9 x number of players cards ). \*coff except for character abilities coff\*\n\nThere are also other concepts I'm thinking of incorporating, like ""empty space"", but I'm hoping for divine inspiration ( or Reddit feedback, that works as well ) and am considering whether having the player's gardens revealed throughout the game or only at the end of the game will provoke more strategic thought. Whether having character cards assigned randomly or chosen or having it up to the player would be better? \n\nI'd like feedback on both card games I'm considering if it's worth it to make. None of them are polished yet, and exact statistics and numbers are not finished. If you'd like more information, just comment below. Thanks!"
ij5k8h,"not really an idea, more of a mechanic.","basically, an rpg game, but instead of the typical three dialog options, it would use the ai from cleverbot and similar sites to generate sentences. each npc would have a personality, and you would be able to talk to them by typing something. if you said something nice that made them happy, they would help you more often and just act friendlier the next time you talk to them. say something that would sound rude to them however, and they would sell things at higher prices, sometimes not even opening shop for you at all depending on how rude you were to them, and just talk angrily to you. sometimes the npc will start talking first, and you can either keep the conversation going, or just say something to make them stop talking, either rudely or  politely. you could be affected either positively or negatively depending on how you act, same as if you started the conversation."
ij2keb,A racing sim based around illegal street racing?,"We have plenty of racing sim games by the dozen. Gran Turismo, Forza Motorsport, and the even more hardcore ones like Iracing and Assetto Corsa. Notice the similarities in all of these? They're all track-based, motorsport focused simulators.\n\nNow, look at games like Need For Speed, Test Drive Unlimited, and Forza Horizon. All are open-world games that deal with street racing, however, they are very arcadey and unrealistic. Are there any examples of street racing games that take it's gameplay seriously? Any interesting gameplay dynamics that could be implemented like having one car that has lasting damage effects between races that you must pay to fix?"

iiyft4,A 2D platformer except it's a puzzle game,"Title. The thing is that the game looks like a platformer but the thing is that you have to détermine in advance the path your character will take. You do this by putting different basic actions together (such as jumping, moving forward, etc.). In each level you only have a limited amount of actions you can put in your sequence. Also would you think a level/puzzle creator would be a good idea for this game, so the player never gets bored?"
iiwcwj,Game that switches between 2 genres,"I'm workshopping ideas for a game and I think I hit on an idea that seems interesting and I was wondering if other people will feel the same. I'm thinking the game will be in 2d.\nEssentially, the game will switch between a 2d platformer and a 2d hack and slash game. In one ""world""/""timeline"" the game would play like a typical platformer (like celeste)  while in the other ""world"" the game would play as a hack and slash. The player would be able to switch between the worlds ""at will"" and in a few scenarios be forced into one or the other.\n\nSorry for the editing if it's poor, I'm on mobile."
iitoy0,Realistic space colonization game (current technology),"I am a fan of city builders and other simulation games. Currently, I spend too much time on 'Dawn of man', a very good prehistoric city builder.\n\nOne period I am really interesting in is space colonization with current / realistic technology and means. \n\nI would love to create a realistic base on the moon / mars... try to make something useful with it, and explore different strategies (robot base first, humans first with no return, moon base first, mars base first...), different technologies (nuclear propulsion ...), even different bases (subterran built with local material, metallic structure brought from earth, inflatable base...).\n\nOne core would be to build a strategy on what you send in the precious kilograms of payload you have (and for Mars you can only send every 2 years if you want to be efficient). Another core would be how to keep your humans healthy and happy. A third point would be to manage production / recycling of water, food, air and whatever other stuff is needed to run the base. Lastly, at some point, you may want to do something you can get money from in your base (I am not sure there are any real-life prospect for mars mining, maybe of precious metals...) ?\n\nAnother element would be to consider whether going first, or waiting a few more years to have better technology, but then having the best sites already taken.\n\nI have in mind a graphic where you see your base and people on it from close. Probably, the graphics would be just good enough that you feel you are there.\n\nWhat do you think ? I feel I really need that, and although I am not a developer specialized in games, I am so desperate I am considering hacking something myself."

iin7p1,War is a Game [Modern Strategy],"Due to ratification by member states, the United Nations member states adopt a universal rule regarding warfare. All combat or conflict between nations must now only take place in the nation of Kazakhstan which has volunteered a large portion of it’s landmass as the terrain of choice. Nations that have border conflicts, independence movements, territorial expansions and so on must now exclusively conduct war under the new rules of the UN. \n\nEach warring state must present its set of arms, weapons and personnel to the conflict. The war will commence and continue until one side accepts defeat or is totally annihilated. To reflect the cost of war, each state must also draft 1% of their civilian population for combat operations. Nations must build facilities and staging areas prior to combat. Rebel groups will be able to use the civilian population as a source of recruits and for camouflage. There are limits on the explosive yields of weapons such as nuclear weapons. Any nation or group that breaks this rules will suffer a reprisal by every other member nation.\n\nThere can be a story-line involved such as a worldwide resistance movement, black marketeers, and the world's most popular reality tv series. Oh, and there's a waiting list.\n\nGame Details: RTS or Turn-Based. Singleplayer and multi-player. No FPS although game details can be adapted to accommodate.\n\nMatch-ups between factions must differentiate in weapon systems and access. There is also the potential for the outright destruction of a smaller nation. However, smaller nations / groups can hire mercenary nations usually for less than favorable terms to add some weight to any beleaguered force. Pyrrhic victory possible even against rebel groups. Progression is based on the player and the war combinations they create. There are no tech trees or upgrades. What they bring to the fight is the only thing of use. Wars may also exist on a point system where the destruction of (x) amount of points will result in certain win / loss conditions being met."
iilrn2,A co-op/campign based game where you and your squadmates try your best at driving a Panzer straight into Soviet land,"Since the game is more co-op based it can be off the rails and random. And if teammates dont cooperate well it can lead to disaster. The game will be set during 1941-1942 and is centered around a tank. Through the chaotic explosions and gunfire (Figured a game like this would have a more cartoony and unrealistic style while without being too out of touch on what really happened.) you have to load tank shells, mow down enemies, repair the tank, and make sure you don't accidentally blow it up from the inside. As you progress it gets harder, as you have to wear more fitting clothing to combat the cold (slowing you down) more enemies fight you in urban areas, and supplies are low. At the start you would advoid mines, and at the end you would advoid a little kid shouting Russian and running at you with an active bomb."
iijb01,Star Wars open world game!,"I just think with how successful Gta V has been with its online, an open world Star Wars game would be amazing.

ib3dem,"A horror game based on the Alma Glitch from F.E.A.R. 2, in which an NPC relentlessly walks toward you throughout the entire game. It's the premise of the movie It Follows but in video game form.","[This is the Alma Glitch I'm talking about.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQZygxNUjZg) Another video of it [can be found here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w77wpwlnwD0) Here's [a better quality video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dj7KKHi6OIE)\n\nThis game would be an otherwise typical action horror game with side objectives and exploration; however, early in the game the player begins being stalked by a supernatural entity that is always moving toward him with steady, unnatural movement. It can't be stopped. If it reaches you, it will kill you and corrupt the two most recent save files. Trying to reuse the latest save files will make the stalker more aggressive and unpredictable, or you can simply load an older save file and lose substantially more progress.\n\nThe maps of the games would be designed to explore, but many areas lead to dead ends and corridors are especially terrifying if you don't know whether or not they lead anywhere. Side objectives and some primary objectives are placed in such precarious dead ends, making you question how far the stalker is and thus much time you have to run in and out.\n\nTalking to NPCs will lock you into the conversation and tight camera angles so you can't easily tell if you're in danger or not. You can skip past dialogue if you're in a hurry, but you can't tell if you'll have skipped important information. As the camera cuts during dialogue, you might see nothing behind you but on the second cut to your character you see the stalker emerge past a doorway into your area.\n\nPause menus pause all gameplay... except for the stalker. It keeps moving."

iax3g5,Open world survival horror taking place in a Disney-esque theme park.,"Something like Firewatch meets Five Nights at Freddy's. \n\n\nObviously taking inspiration from the FNAF franchise, you are hired to help out with overnight security in a massive amusement park due to an increased number of break-ins, vandalism, and other odd events. \n\n\nSimilar to Firewatch, you communicate with the other security guards via walkie, and rarely see anyone else in the park. \n\n\nPretty soon, you are sent to different parts of the park to investigate noises, weird lights, and other oddities. ""Why did the haunted house attraction just start running on its own?"" Before long, it's clear that something supernatural is occuring, and the other security guards slowly start losing communication, until eventually you have nothing but your thoughts to keep you company. Oh, and the occasional ""costumed"" character. \n\n\nOther ideas : \n\n\nYour map is styled after a brochure theme park map. \n\n\nDisney-esque tunnel system under the park. \n\n\nMetroidvania aspects - finding keys, gaining access to other sectors of the park, and tools that open other routes. \n\n\nVery non-linear. Explore the different disturbances in any order you choose, hindered only by occasional gating. Pursue your main task, or take some time to search for your missing co-workers and other side activities. \n\n\nExplorable attractions - the Haunted House, the Mummy's Tomb, the Museum, etc. \n\n\nThemed ""Lands"", or sectors of park. Storybook Land, The Fairy Forest, Dino World, Ghost Town, Space Zone, etc. \n\n\nOther notes. \n\nI realize there's already a game called ""The Park"", which I played and thought was *fine*. I believe this is much better concept with a lot more possibilities. \n\nAs far as other games that have done something like this, I think Silent Hill 3 probably had the best theme park area of any game I've played. I'd love to see a full fledged attempt at something like that."

What I mean by this is you will have to follow a request as closely as possible (For example: “I would like to have a longsword that shoots fireballs”) and then use that weapon to get through a platformer game level and get to the house where you deliver the item to the person who asked for it. You get more money for the quality of the item. You also don’t want to overuse the magic item, as overuse will cause it to break, making your total money collected decrease until it hits zero after breaking!\n\nThe game would have a story mode, and at the end of the game you can just create your own magic weapons and dick around, maybe in a post game where you get to be a mighty adventurer for yourself?\n\nI might use this idea myself, but I wanted to know what you guys thought of it!"

After that, it rapidly spread, infecting many people across the city and spreading through airports into other nations too. Now, humanity sits on the cusp of an apocalypse that threatens society as we know it...\n\nWhich is where you come in! You are the leader of a new UN department / private company / something similar (maybe you lead a country?) who knows the true threat of the living dead, and you need to defend population centres, mobilise global armies and militias and build fortifications along mountain ranges to defend humanity against a mutating zombie plague! Can you save humanity, or will your efforts not be enough to prevent the end of civilisation as we know it?\n\nFeatures:\n\nConvince governments to let you assume control of their armed forces to combat the zombie threat! The scarier the apocalypse looks (especially in their country or neighbouring nations), the more likely they are to accept.\n\nFace off against hostile governments to work out how they’re fighting the zombie apocalypse through satellite photography, espionage or even forcing a coup so the nation is ruled by a sympathetic regime!\n\nBuild defences along natural barriers like mountains, rivers, straits and forests (or other places) to make safe zones in countries and hold off the zombies until you can import troops from elsewhere or they get air striked into oblivion!\n\nExploit weather patterns to help you destroy zombies faster and better! (ie liberating the Southwest and Mexico in summer, South Asia in monsoon season, Scandinavia in winter, etc.) \n\nTry to rescue the global economy by defending population hubs, securing shipping lanes, natural resources, investing in surviving nations and winning key battles to restore investors’ trust in the global economy!\n\nFind ways to treat and cure the zombie infection to reduce outbreaks in secured territory!\n\nSlow down the virus’ spread through travel bans, quarantines and tests once they are researched!\n\nEvacuate survivors in infected zones or areas threatened by zombies to refugee camps in safe zones to secure your reputation and keep the human population high, as well as returning them home once their homes have been liberated and secured.\n\nMake contact with and supply safe zones in infected regions to keep them surviving until your forces liberate it!\n\nDeal with random events and a mutating plague that can make or break your game!\n\nThe interface would be a world map a la Plague Inc or something similar, with infected lands in black and maybe armies as pieces you can move about to fight zombies, with a bunch of info ledgers at the top with info about the estimated world population, your resources and other important stuff to know. Maybe there’s an area where you can do research and develop tactics like media control to help convince governments to help you? I’m not sure.\n\nI have little knowledge of programming, so this could be really easy or really hard to make. But I think it sounds fun."

In the beginning of the game, players create their own Division agent by customizing the character's gender and appearance.

In addition to direct combat, the player can use plasmids to lure enemies into traps or to turn enemies against each other, or employ stealth tactics to avoid detection by hostiles including the gangs, monsters and turrets. The player can [hack](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_(computer_security)) into any of Rapture's automated systems; the hacking process is done via a mini-game similar to Galaga,Space Invaders,Centipede,Crisis Force and M.U.S.H.A.

ialqiv,Are there any 2D games with a foreground and background that can be entered?,I'm thinking of making like a metroidvania or adventure platformer of some sort (although maybe the genres probably dont fit too well with the concept). \n\nI'm looking for either a game to model it off of or ideas to make it work. Maybe as a stealth mechanism?\n\nSomething like in fatal fury where you can attack from the foreground and back ground.
iaiv9s,A rogue like metroidvania but instead of finding weapons you kill enemy’s to steal their powers,"I want to become a game developer in the future and I’ve had this idea for a while. The game would be a rogulike metroidvania game (like dead cells) but instead of finding weapons like in dead cells you kill enemy’s to steal their powers (like Kirby). The difference would be that in Kirby when you eat an enemy you steal their ability’s, but you can only have one ability at a time. This game would let you have as many abilities as you can get. In dead cells you can use cells to buy new weapons that you can find. Well what if in this game there is an npc that you can give the games currency to and they set free a new type of enemy with its own level of difficulty and ability you get for killing it. As far as progression goes I think that after you kill a certain amount of the same enemy, you unlock a new perk or ability for whatever that’s enemy withholds (for example an enemy that when you kill gives the rest of your attacks a poison effect. If you kill say 25 more of that same enemy you can choose an ability to gain along with the poison ability. I’m thinking this would be something like beating a level in nuclear throne where you get to choose between 4 or 5 ability’s. I have also thought About this causing every run to feel the same with you just killing the same enemies each time and going the same places, but with this I feel like I could make branching paths that lead to different ends of the game with all of them ranging in difficulty. This might be too much but maybe somewhere around 10 different paths. These could even interconnect between each other so say your going down one path but you want to switch so you could go to a different area to go down a different path. I have a general idea of what i want the graphics of the game to look like and the biggest problem I see with making this game would be balancing it. I really don’t want this game to turn into one of those rogue likes where you just become god no matter what. I want the game to have the same difficulty curve that I’ve seen in a lot of rogue likes where it starts out really hard but then you keep getting better with each run. This is a game I would love to make in the future and I’m building my first pc right now so I can learn game developing. I just posted this to see what other people think about it so I can get feedback, thank you to anyone that does."
iagp5u,FPS Psuedo lock on,"Basically I hate it when in FPS shooters, the closer enemies/NPCs are, the more difficult it is to shoot them.\n\nI propose a lock on mechanic (similar to Metroid Prime) that will make you character follow an enemy outside of aiming mode - aiming disables lock on - and firing while locked on will have a hit chance dependent on the distance. \n\nSo. The results would be: if something is close, you can just fire and will probably hit them (if they are next to you, you may even put the gun to their head / chest). Distant foes must be aimed at, but looking down the sights would get the reticle close.\n\nAdditionally a reticle independent from the camera may be available when locked on."
iadewy,Pestilence - a stealth based game about pests,"The player spawns into the level as some sort of pest animal (ex. mouse, mosquito, fly, tick, flea, cockroach, silverfish, moth, snails, caterpillars, etc.) and has to avoid the attention and wrath of the humans it cohabits the home with (and possibly other pests that may want to eat it). Throughout the game, the GUI changes to mimic that particular pest's senses (ex. a fly would have blurry, compound vision which allows it to see a wide FOV, so FOV is set to 270 and the graphics are a bit blurred). Players get points for doing species specific tasks (ex. flying near light sources for moths and fly players, finding mates for moth players, or landing on food for fly players). After a relatively easy grind for the player however, the humans catch on and start to bring out the tools designed to bring about your demise - fly swatters, fly paper, baseball bats, cleverly disguised live traps, deadly traps that mimic food, water, light, heat, mate odors, etc, whatever the pest is attracted to. The player has to determine whether food is food or food is actually a trap by examining clues about the mystery item. There may be some puzzle elements to determining whether something is safe or dangerous as well, but the player is required to make a decision fast due to the gradually increasing hunger meter. Game may have upgrades (ex. quieter footsteps for rodents, anesthetic for bloodsucking pests, etc.). For blood sucking pests that have landed on humans or pets, the screen may move with the host to clue the player into whether the human is about to move and squish them."
iacda6,Help with the idea for a game I'm making!,"So basically I wanted to make a game like ""The First Tree"" then I started working on this adventure-exploration game with a fox and with cool environments, the problem is that I'm stuck with the story, I don't know what story to tell! Can someone help me? Here are some screenshots of the first level :\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/4yteuZJ](https://imgur.com/a/4yteuZJ)"
iac7uw,"A game that combines elements of animal crossing, stardew valley, and skyrim","I've been thinking about this concept for a while now. A free roam/open world game, with optional quests, with cute little animal characters to play as. You can either do the quests and get rewards, or don't! Build your house and garden and such. I think it would be fun to be multiplayer on a server or something, kind of like how stardew offers, but instead the perspective is just a bit different."
ia8sm8,We need a 100 player battle royal fighting game.,"I’m talking bout a free roam game with a map like fortnite, warzone, ect, on a island but instead of skyscrapers, ect. It can be gyms or smaller buildings with nothing but melee weapons only. Brass knuckles, nun chucks, swords, knifes, boxing gloves, ect. And not just have basic punches and kicks, but full blown combos and specials like in mortal combat that you can unlock in the store or battle pass!"
ia8jml,My Idea,"What if Paradox Made A Game Called &gt;!Red Forces!&lt;. &gt;!Red Forces!&lt; is A Grand Strategy Game, Like HOI4 but A &gt;!Communist!&lt; World You can Be Fascist Too! So Please Like My Idea!"
ia7opz,"A Stock trading gam,e with wacky companies",A stock trading game that has parody companies. There are random events that affect the market and a news menu where you can keep up to date on companies. There is a card system that allows you to boost or damage a companies stock price. You compete against friends or AI to make the most money
ia71ey,Mimic Prop Hunt,"Its prop hunt but with a twist: In a fantasy setting, players take turns being the mimic, a being that has roots in D&amp;D that can transform itself to look like anything - treasure chest usually, but it can also act as weapons, tables, chairs, doors, levers, torches. The mimic is harmless and weak at the start of the round, being only able to flop around and copy the form of any other objects found in the dungeon (which is randomized each round). Once a player interacts with the mimic (say, the mimic becomes a treasure chest and is opened by a player, or if it becomes a weapon which is picked up by a player), it gains the ability to reveal itself - where it gains invulnerability, the ability to rampage around and kill players for a limited period of time - after which it reverts to its weak unrevealed form. \n\nOther players can't hurt/damage each other, but compete with each other to gather loot in the dungeon. Players are kept paranoid about stuff they interact with and can use the weapons they collect to hack down stuff, however weapons are not durable and have limited use, and treasure chests that are destroyed provide lower rewards. (Plus that weapon wielded may just be a mimic lying in wait for his tpk opportunity!) Maybe there's usual dungeon stuff like low-level NPCs spawning and traps to also keep players on edge.\n\nIf the mimic gets killed it gets to respawn again (with a delay as penalty). If players get killed, they respawn as a mimic minion, and help the master mimic in wiping out the remaining party.\n\nThere's also a timer, so once it runs out all mimics transform permanently, and all players get a magical compass that points them to the nearest treasure.\n\nBecause players are competing against each other (rather than hunters playing co-op in a prop hunt), players can mess with each other if they spot the mimic early on, so its not just mindgames with the mimic. The round is over once all players are killed by the mimic (mimic wins) or all treasures are looted (player with the most loot wins).\n\nPlanning to make this multiplayer but I'm keen to hear any feedback on this idea (especially from prop hunt gamer fans, as I'm pretty new to it!)"
ia47vy,A dungeon crawler sandbox game...,"Basics: \n  The game would be titled ""Pittle"". You play as Pittle. A young hero who kind of sucks at being a hero. You live in the small village of Wioska which is guarded by mountains. You speak to everybody in town and everybody moans about not being able to leave town. You explore Wioska and find out the reason why nobody is able to leave town... The only exit is a dungeon! A dungeon full of the undead, traps, and puzzles! You enter the dungeon and get killed instantly! Why? Because you have no weapon! But there are no weapons in Wioska! Looks like you'll have to.....\nGameplay:\n  .....Craft something! Crafting and mining is a big part of Pittle! You knock down a tree with your fists (Sound familiar?) and make a work bench. With the leftover pieces of what wood you have left you craft some sticks and make some tools. An axe, pickaxe, and sword! With these items you can head into the dungeon and survive! In the dungeon you will get tons of loot from enemies. But every enemies drops something else as well... Crafting materials! Enemies will drop some average crafting materials but occasionally you can get a material only available in dungeons! With these materials you can craft great weapons which are much better than the loot you would find in dungeons! Anyways... Once you're out of the dungeon you are able to explore The Land at your own pace! You can now explore mini-dungeons! Do side quests! Go mining! And save ""The Land"" from impending doom!\n  So far I don't have a finished story but I will finish it soon!\n\n\n\n\n\nP.S I know Pittle means to urinate. It's intentional..."
ia25f3,Wacky Game Idea,"my game idea is a bit weird and complicated but its just a idea for yall experts out there. its a third person shooter (kinda not really) with a small selection of characters who specializes in certain things i have not yet came up as far as thinking wat characters do exactly but i want it too be special and something that gives it a advantage and disadvantages. (example: how about a grenade launcher but instead of a avarage grenade launcher with extra bouncy or sticky grenades) i also want these characters to have a skill that gives the player a advantage in the battle field. (grenade launcher guy can eject bunch of grenades around him that heals him but hurts enemies and teammates.) i also would like maps to be abstract but not one sided. this game shall have different game modes so u never get bored of the same mechanics(low gravity, floor is lava(just dont make it boring)) i would recommend a free beta first to see games responses and how people react plus feedback that includes one map one mode and two champions. DM me for questions"
ia0hly,need ideas for a budget Soul clone!,"so I have been toying around with a beat'em up project and I ended up deciding that I am better off making a budget Soul Clone. It is a much more realistic project for the time being. \n\nMy question is, what kind of gimmicky theme/style/etc can I throw into the game? I want to see if I can hit the sweet spot where the game is gimmicky enough to advertise itself and have enough gameplay that people wouldnt ask for a refund\n\n1. anime girls and umm... physics. It has been done before so I don't know if a lesser indie version would be much of a draw. It seems like indie anime games get some followings regardless of quality, but I am not sure\n2. furries? I haven't heard of a furry Soul yet (as far as I know) but I don't understand what furry fans actually would like\n3. memes? e.g. virgin vs chad... feels like it may be in poor taste though\n4. orc vs human cliche? I thought about maybe adding some social commentary but it also feels like it would end up being a terrible idea\n\nI need ideas!"
i9zf3k,An open world game set in the world of pandora (Disney’s avatar),"I just recently went to animal kingdom in Disney world and I know this most likely won’t happen but the new avatar section they made in the park blew me away from how beautiful and real it looked. I feel like if in the right hands avatar would make a great open world game. You could be a human trying to explore the world or pandora and the story could involve finding some sort of giant monster to fight in the end, or something else since I haven’t seen the movie in a while I’ve forgotten the story. The world could be big and you could ride around on a banshee sort of like...(anthem is a bad comparison)...Breath of the wild. Also, the graphics could look great from how beautiful pandora already is and it would be great to top it off with ray tracing."
i9zajn,An interesting take on Battle Royale,"Hear me out, alright. I know this genre is super tired by now but I just thought of what I thought could be a cool concept and I wanted to see what other people would think.\n\nBasically, you have a large square map (kinda like Hyper Scape's) with exactly 100 identical (or very similar) 3 story buildings. Each player would spawn in a building so that there is one building for every person. The player quickly loots their building (each building would have to have pretty much the same loot to keep things balanced) and it becomes a last man standing deathmatch. Instead of a zone closing in, the player's spawn building disappears when they die, freeing up more lines of sight for other players.\n\nI literally just thought of this and wanted to write it down somehow and I thought this sub would be a good place for that. I'd love to hear y'alls thoughts :)"
i9ya01,The Convoy: An action-racing game set in the post-apocalypse,"Think Mad Max meets Fast and Furious. Maybe add Twisted metal into the mix\n\nHowever instead of driving one car, you lead an entire convoy of cars, sort of like a train/fleet of cars.\n\nThe player can set up different driving formations for the team, and recruit new types racers (with unique classes and ). Also, there's permadeath. If a teammate dies in their car, they're lost forever. Players can choose to execute risky manoeuvres to rescue  teammates while driving/racing. \n\nGameplay involves racing around the Wasteland, looking to control territories by racing rival gangs in destruction style races, where the winners are the cars that SURVIVE. \n\nCars would need to be maintained (based on their build) and UPGRADED, in order to win more races and build reputation. \n\nMissions involve chases, road combat, high stakes transporting and heists. Other side challenges can include team deathmatch-style Demolition Derby."
i9y38j,My Unique Fighting Game Ideas," \n\nAs a fan of the fighting game genre, I like to spend some time planning and designing my own ideas for a fighting game. So far, I have 3 different ones I have in mind and I want to see which one seems the most interesting to all.\n\n1. A 2D/2.5D fighter that heavily focuses on grounded movement and gives players lots of control when maneuvering on the ground. Like being able to cancel dashes, having a run, etc.\n\nHowever, what makes this idea even more unique is that the combat system is mainly predicated on the use of Tekken-like strings, with the added ability to be able to cancel into special moves like in most 2D fighters.\n\n2. A 3D fighter that is heavily modeled after Tekken; but, heavily incorporates various elements from the 2D fighter genre as well. Like having a command jump, having a universal cancel mechanic (similar to Akuma's FADC's from T7), having an alpha counter mechanic, etc.\n\n3. Similar to #2 but this time it purely revolves around the sport of boxing and mixes core elements and fundamentals of boxing with the general design formula of Tekken. Like having sways/weaves as ways to evade attacks (on top of side-stepping as well), having a stun system similar to SFV, recoverable health, a heavy emphasis on counter-hits, heavy use of stances, etc.\n\nEdit: another idea I just had is a 2D/2.5D fighter that primarily revolves around the sport of pro wrestling, particularly inspired by the attitude and ruthless aggression eras of the WWE.\n\nOf course, since this is a wrestling based fighting game, it would have mechanics such as a reversal system, grapple mechanics, maybe even fighter personalities (grappler, brawler, big man, etc), etc."
i9upw6,I’m on a road trip for the next two days and I want to make a game before I get home. Any ideas?,Hello! I’m currently working on a long term project with a friend and I think it would be fun to make a game in two days for a little break. And so I thought that this is a perfect opportunity! Let me know your ideas!

Open a portal and off you pop."
i9ps8q,"A PS5 survival horror game without ANY graphics. (obviously not my idea, but I thought this has potential)",
i9hq22,A puzzle/mystery game for blind people?,"I was brainstorming ideas for games that I can make on a limited budget with a relatively small scope, and I had the idea to make a game that relies solely on Audio to convey information to the player.\n\nThe sound design would have to be pretty good for people to be willing to try it; I’m thinking a massive array of sound effects, a narrator (who would likely be voiced by me), maybe a little voice acting from others, and audio cues to convey information to the players.\n\nThe game would require players to navigate a world and solve puzzles in a world where they can’t actually see anything. The controls would also have to be pretty simple too, considering the initial concept was literally a game for blind people (though sighted players could achieve the same affect by turning off all the lights, or just closing their eyes). \n\nThe player shouldn’t be expected to move their hands around a keyboard where they can’t see, so their hands need to be planted in the same spots the entire time. The keys that need to be pressed should also be easy to locate for similar reasons. I’m thinking that the arrow keys on the keyboard (to be able to move around), and the space bar (to function like an enter key) would be perfect for these reasons. \n\nThere are some potential issues I can already foresee, though.\n\n1. How do I separate atmospheric sounds from audio cues? In a typical game, you can see the difference between a check point and a tree, for example. In this game, it may be easy to mistake something for a random background noise.\n\n2. Especially for sighted players, how could this concept draw interest, and how the hell could I possibly advertise something without any visuals to show off?"

i986kz,Need some ideas for a creativity-inspiring twist on Angry Birds,"So, I've bee using Unity for about a year now to develop various games mainly for mobile. I have started all kinds of projects mainly for fun, none of which have been completed. Now, I want to actually start a game and finish it so that it can be published to mobile stores.\n\nI've come up with an idea, it is a twist on the classic Angry Birds game. You build your own catapults, trebuchets, battering rams etc using a range of objects including planks, blocks, balls, motors, springs, rope and more. You use your builds to attack an enemy base on each level. There are multiple levels, each with increasing difficulty, which you have to complete.\n\nOverall, this is a generally basic idea, you play levels and complete them, so I need some more additional features to spice the game up a bit. This could be an idea for game modes, anything related to gameplay or anything else. Right now, the game is small and there isnt much to so, I need some ideas to expand it and make it more enjoyable in the long term.\n\nOne idea I've thought of is:\n\n-Enemy bases have guard troops and you are also given the option to deploy troops onto the battlefield, which will attack the guards. Ally troops can be launched towards the enemy base using the builds you have made. For example, a catapult can launch an ally straight towards the enemy base, or a battering ram can drive the ally towards the enemy base\n\nAny thoughts are welcome. Even if they arent realistic, they will still give some inspiration."

If someone votes for the computer generated true fact, they receive points for guessing right, and if someone votes for another players ""fact"", the player that made it up will receive points.\n\nNote: I am not a video game designer, although I hope to be one day, so this is just a loose idea.

Here goes.\n\nokay here’s my gameplay idea ""FLOW""\n\na party based rpg with a day to day calandar type system\n\njust like persona, you're given an assortment of maps and an amount of ingame time/days to complete the maps \n\neveryone is assigned a flow, whats flow ?\n\nflow is your personal beats per minute, rhythm, if you will. each character will have a definite internal flow, making it easier for them to use weapons near that internal rhythm, their first weapon is gonna be close to but not identical to this rhythm so you aren't completely in the dark when it comes to equipping your party members with weapons.\n\nwhen characters are deployed together / mc spends time with them their flows will begin to sync and combat capabilities are amped, combinations are more possible\n\nthe aim of combat is to disrupt your opponents rhythm or take out all of their hp. i take inspo from this in the hxh chimera ant gungi scene where meruem explains that everyone has a rhythm and once it is disrupted, you lose. so i'm taking a little bit too literal lol\n\nwhen you attack, you have to time your attacks on a rhythm game sort of music staff, lower flow weapons have longer but more spaced notes, similar to bass. higher flow weapons have shorter but more abundant notes. \n\nevery party member is a blank slate and is assigned another definite value upon them joining your party, being what you're naturally good at. i wanna compile all the components of combat then figure out what boon/banes ill assign\n\neach weapon is assigned a bpm, if you like fast playstyles, use a higher bpm weapon, like a guitar. if you like slower playstyles try using a drums. \n\nupon equipping a weapon not identical to your internal weapon flow, your iwf will quickly gravitate to the weapons flow, non synced flows have distorted attacks (sped up or slowed down notes, removing certain notes in songs or having a different pattern of notes)\n\nmc can use any weapon, once flows are synced you can start ranking up your mastery of the weapon class. mc can also take time for himself to write songs or go to his friends for help, events that take up time. \n\ncan also hang out with party members and merchants, hanging out with party members allows closer relationship flow, while hanging out with merchants allows better deals and personal weapon creation\n\nnot a lot of weapons, very easy to stick to weapons without wanting to switch\n\nwould you play this game?\n\ni’m considering using rpg maker to make the game, if anyone wants to have a more personal talk about my vision for this game and it’s story."

i8h9nq,Earthbending your way through my tile based roguelike.,"Hi guys, I'm an indie dev and I need your creative help!\n\nWhat I'm proposing is a narrative roguelike where two characters battle creatures on a transformable tilemap. Each character has a distinct fighting style: the first one is a classic fighter with weapons and special abilities/attacks. The second is capable of raising the ground, tearing the tilemap appart and moving the tiles in more defensive ways to avoid taking damage.\n\nThe movement is similar to what you would see in crypt of the necrodancer but without the rythm. The enemies in this game will typically just come up to you and deal damage, but can also use projectiles and some of them will also possess this earthbending skill.\n\nWhat I'm looking for are spell ideas to make the concept of earthbending tiles more interesting. (And roguelike attack paterns too while I'm at it.)\n\nThank you."

i86yru,Thanks u/HamsterIV for further elaborating on my idea for a tank crew simulator game.,"Tank Crew Simulator\nIntro\n\nTank Crew simulator will be a multiplayer cooperative game where 1 or 4 players operate the various stations of a tank. The game will be simple enough to play on a tablet or phone. The four roles will be commander, driver, gunner, and engineer. Game modes will allow for 1 team completing a series of objectives against the environment or 2 teams fighting each other in a defined battle area.\n\n\nUI\n\nAll players will have a UI that includes a 360 degree compass for both world orientation and local vehicle orientation. A tab bar across the top will allow the player to see all the tank roles and if another player is occupying one\n\n\nThe Commander gets a 3rd person view of the game but no inputs that will affect the tank. They can zoom in and out. Their main job will be to relay turret coordinates to the gunner and driving coordinates to the driver. They also get to see the heat sensor array on the tank similar to the engineer. The commander will be able to access the world map and set a waypoint on it to assist the driver and gunner with destination\n\n\nThe Engineer controls power distribution between the tracks and the turret. This will determine how fast the tank drives and turns. As well as how fast the turret turns and elivates. It will be desirable for lower power settings to be set for fine adjustments and higher power for gross movement. The engineer's main interface is a triangular touch pad that routes power between tracks, turret, and idle. The engineer will also have a series of toggles for things like smoke generators, and fire extinguishers.\n\n\nThe Gunner will have four buttons that adjust the orientation of the turret, the rotation speed will depend on the engineer’s power setting. There will be a loading progress indicator as well as an indicator of what round is loaded. The gunner can load different rounds by clicking on the shot locker grid. The gunner will have a limited view of the outside world through a small port hole and a zoom slider. This view will line up with the cannon and allow for small adjustments.\n\n\nThe driver will have two sliders to control the power going to each track. The driver can apply this power in full forward, half forward, idle, half back, and full back. The driver will be able to see out the forward vector of the tank. The movement of the tracks will be determined by the power the engineer funnels to the track transmission.\n\n\nGame mechanics\n\nThis game will take place in a defined arena space. The tank will have a shot locker of 16 shells and there will be a staging point where the tank can restock. The shell types will be:\n\nHigh explosive - does damage in an area with a moderate damage bonus for direct hits\nArmor piercing - does massive damage with a direct hit, but no splash damage, limited ability to shoot through buildings.\nSmoke - simulates a tank’s smoke generating ability only at longer range\n\nThe tank will traverse the game world via the unity physician engine applying forward and backwards energy to the rigid body at the point of track contact with the ground. Because the tank will not always rest on level ground the tank commander will have pips to indicate the turret turn and elevation  necessary to generate a shot at the center point of the commander’s screen.\n\n\nHydraulic Energy distribution will be an important aspect for both vehicle control and turret control. The turret will turn faster when more energy is sent to the turret but this may be undesirable when making fine changes. Likewise the driver will experience a similar game mechanic with the speed of the treds.\n\n\nTank death occurs when the shotlocker overheats and its internal fuel and ammo supply explodes. Various components over the tank can take damage and start overhearing. If left unchecked the overheat can spread to the shot locker and explode. The engineer has control over the coolant system that will counter this overheat effect. There is a limited supply of coolant  (restockable at the staging point) if the coolant runs out and the tank is still damaged it will eventually explode. If there is an active damage situation the engineering station will be highlighted.\n\n\nThe driver and turret roles have state buttons that determine how fast the tank is moving or turret spinning. These states drop to 0 if a player transfers away from the role. For example if there is only one player and they are in the driver role driving full speed ahead. Should that player swap to the gunner role the driver station will automatically zero out the drivetrains and the tank will come to a halt.\n\n\nThe engineer can generate a smoke screen from the tanks engines and the gunner can place smoke rounds, these actions will create vision obscuring smoke that lingers for a while and obscures vision. For AI purposes smoke colliders will be placed 1000 units up from the smoke cloud and any tank spotting must be done at ground level and at the 1000 unit up level to ensure the AI can’t cheat and see through the smoke.\n\n\nSome levels will feature airstrikes, where enemy or allied air power will swoop in and straif the crap out of a tank. The players will have advance notice of an oncoming airstrike and have the chance to get under cover, either in a wood, under smoke or under a building. In vs multi player games the teams will alternate airstrikes.\n\n\nSome levels will feature AI infantry and static anti tank guns. These will be scripted into the scenario and provide additional challenges and targets for the player.\n\n\nScenarios:\n\n\nCo-op Levels\n\nTraining - Provides a course and instruction on how to navigate, drive, aim and repair the tank. Various stations around a simulated village will give the player\n\n\nSpeed Run - same layout as the training level except there will be no prompts, a timer will count down how long it takes the players to drive from point a to point b while engaging various targets at range.\n\n\nConvoy ambush - Attack a convoy of trucks making their way through a winding forest road. Drive through the forest to  get ahead of the convoy before it flees to safety.\n\n\nTown Siege - lay down coving fire and smoke screens to help allied forces assault a town. Move between hills around the town to get optimal firing angles.\n\n\nTown Assault - drive your tank through a town engaging enemy infantry and anti tank guns at point blank range.\n\n\nBunker Complex Assault - drive your tank through a bunker complex nestled in a hilly woodland. Infantry and anti tank guns are hidden in randomly placed bunkers.\n\n\nAirport Assault -  Secure an airport and destroy evacuation transports. Enemy infantry and anti tank guns may be hidden amid the buildings. Enemy airstrikes are a threat\n\n\nVS Levels\n\nRolling hills - rolling hills dominate a river valley, tree cover can be found next to the river and in sparse pockets between the hills. Good for long range tank dules. Alternating airstrikes are an option.\n\n\nTown - copy of the town map only with no AI forces running around. Narrow streets and destroyable buildings should result in very close range action. Alternating airstrikes are an option.\n\n\nBunker complex - same as the bunker complex woodland. Low visibility due to fog forces players to engage at close range. Too cloudy and wooded for airstrikes.\n\n\nAirport - Same as the airport assaut, large buildings are good for hiding from air strikes. The open runway area in the middle is good for long range duels. Alternating airstrikes are an option.\n  \nThank you for reading and feel free to give suggestions."
i86ils,Blob game mode mechanic for shooters,I used to marshall paintball and 30+person nerf wars and one of the funnest modes was Blob. You divide battlefield in 4 equal parts with the same minimal amount of cover kn each. Each area has 1/4 of the total players to start. Players can't leave their area BUT whoever they shoot/tag/kill must exit whatever area they are in and join the area/team of whoever killed them. Thus teams grow and absorb players like a blob. \n\nWhen an area loses all its players referees run a tape down the middle and each adjacent team absorbs a half. Usually it devolves into 2 teams rallying agsinst each other.
i85iix,galactic scale Base builder/survival game in the Battlezone universe.,"Was playing a bit of Battlezone 98 Redux and was thinking that I would really like to play it on a larger scale and with friends. \n\nFirst off, I am imagine a slightly different pricing model from the normal. The game is online only and basically free to play if you want to join an open game or an official server. However, if you would like to have your own space to cultivate with friends you will need to rent a server. Each server is a randomly generated planetary system with a star, 4-12 planets consisting of rocky planets and gas giants, as well as asteroid belts.\n\nIf you rent a server you will find your planetary system is occupied by the CCP (AI badguys). You must settle down on one of the planets and expand from there until the whole system is under your control.\n\nThroughout this process you will be collecting a myriad of resources for crafting things such as new buildings, defensive structures, offensive and defensive vehicles as well as hiring AI pilots to run those vehicles. \n\nOnce you feel satisfied with how you have built your planetary defenses you can build an interstellar launch pad that will allow you to move troops and equipment from your system to another. Once used however, your planetary system is detectable to others and can be invaded.\n\nDuring PVP the goal is to destroy the enemy defenses and push them out of the system and take it over. Players who are successful in PVP can have several planetary system at any given time but the more they have the harder it will be to manage their defenses. Those who are not successful will be pushed out with whatever unit that were left and will need to settle a new system but this time with more resources and more experience."

i84umz,Transport Helicopter Pilot RTS (Choplifter spiritual successor),"You play as a transport chopper pilot who ferries AI teammates and equipment around the map. \n\nThe troops load up at a friendly base and can be dropped anywhere you choose. \n\nYou can drop as many troops that you have resources for and they will stay there until given the attack order. Once the order is given they will move to attack the nearest enemy base or any troops they have made contact with. \n\nThe map would be divided into sectors that would have to be captured in sequence to maintain supply lines. Think planetside 2's lattice system. \n\nI think if I was going to prototype this I would do it in GTA's FiveM since it has AI players, good helicopter physics, and a large map that could be cut up into separate areas."
i7xm9f,FPS Base Builder,"My idea for a new style of game that as far as i'm aware hasn't been created is a base builder fps, I myself have no experience, time or desire to create a game however I am an avid PC gamer and would love this game style. In this game i'd want to see  at least 4 teams but really the more the better with 4 players per team, each player per team would start out in a section of map which is exclusive to there team, this location is specific to them as to this is where there spawn beacon would be placed, they would start with a starting weapon of there choice and a limited amount of ammo depending on the weapon, they would have a 4 sticky explosives that could be used for breaching walls and a pick-axe for harvesting resources, they also would start with building supplies to create a base as big as they want and as complex as they can make it, these supplies are shared among the team and can be collected by any player on the team, there would be a set time for there building phase, nothing to long i.e 5-8 mins. While in the building phase there could be randomized weapon drops to help the team on there decision of raiding or defending. Once the building phase has come to an end there building supplies are cut to a low but not empty state, it is then up to the players to defend or raid, defending would come down to having the proper structure in place to withstand the force of enemies trying to raid, this would also make it hard to expand there base further because there would be no teammates out collecting resources. Raiding would be having the weapons to do the damage to take down enemy bases along with enemies. With raiding you would be able to gain supplies by killing enemies and destroying there base, making it so your base can be further reinforced, there can be out posts where you can trade resources in to get upgraded gear i.e better guns, armor, med kits, the list goes on.  The end goal is to be the last team standing, winning by all other spawn beacons being destroyed. \n\nI'd love to hear feedback or suggestion to make this game better and maybe one day this will come to life!"

i7vf2j,A Cricket game in D&amp;D like Strategy card game style,"I have no experience in Game development. I am trying to create a Cricket card game. The game goes like this\n\n* Both players get a set of randomly selected player cards based on their team composition\n* All players have fixed skill levels for batting, bowling , fielding etc.\n* During each delivery, the bowler is given 5 to 6 delivery type cards ( Spin,swing, bouncer etc.) to choose from. The bowler can freely choose to select line and length in a 3x3 grid. Based on the pitch parameters and the type of delivery, the ball's position when it reaches the batsman is calculated in 4x3 grid. ( A lot of this is probabilistic ). After all this, the delivery quality can be obtained by sampling from a skewed distribution( Good bowlers bowl better quality deliveries more often and vice versa ).\n* The other player handling the batsman, has partial information about pitch zone of the delivery and no idea about the type of delivery or its quality. Now he has to choose from a set of 5 to 6 cards for the type of shot to play ( Grounded, defense, lofted, helicopter shot, sweep etc.). The batsman is free to choose the zone in which to hit the ball at ( the ground is divided into 8 zones, 4 in each side ). The shot quality is again sampled from a similar distribution. ( Bad quality shots often result in the ball going in some unintended direction or edges, good quality shots result in favourable outcomes more often ).\n* Before every ball, a set of 9 fielders are stationed in any of the 72 fielding slots available. ( 8 zones - 3 subzones each - each subzone having 3 positions ( Close, on circle and deep ) )\n* Based on the shot played, ball position when reaching batsman, shot quality, ball quality, and some randomness, the direction with which the ball goes is determined. Also each combination results in a different fielder coming into play. Fielders also sample from a distribution to get fielding effort. ( Good shots are difficult to stop, and require good efforts and vice versa ). After all this, the result of one ball is calculated.\n\n* As in typical cricket, the match can happen for 20 overs / 5 overs anything.\n* Each player has a set of specific skills, which can modify the quality of shots/ball quality for some specific situation. ( A spin specialist receives a boost against spinners. A swing bowler bowls better swing deliveries etc. )\n\nMy doubt here is..\n* I have started work on this, and i am figuring out a lot of specifics and it looks doable. But.. will it be interesting at all ? \n* Does anyone still play text based games ? Because this can be done text based which is easy(-ier) for me to do alone.\n* Do you see any problem i am ignoring here !?"
i7uhdn,literally just real life in a video game,"INTRO I\nobviously this is way too big of a project for most devs here, let alone myself. however, i've had the idea for a while and just wanted someone to know about it.\n\nINTRO II\nthe first thing that turned myself off about my own idea was MMO in the steam tags. i'd imagined a first person, basic graphics, life simulator with rapid aging and permadeath. this would pretty much only work if the game was popular right off the bat, though, because of a birth and death mechanic.\n\nBASICS\nwhen you first spawn (or are ""born"") you live in a completely random area of a completely fictional world. you could live in a huge city, a tribal, barbaric island, the suburbs, a small village, anything. what's more, your character would have stats and attributes that can only be changed via certain activities. (i.e. if you were to be born into a starving village, your health attributes would be low, or if you were born a prodigy, your intellect would be high)\n\nIN-DEPTH\nof course, all of these things can be changed with varying difficulty based on where you would be born. if you were born into a utopia and were unhealthy, it would be easier for a doctor to treat you. as implied before, many attributes are based almost entirely on where you live, or what job/hobbies you take up.\n\nJUNK YOU CAN DO FOR A LIVING\njobs, schooling, and hobbies are all optional parts of the game, but schooling is determined by where you live and your parents, who would ideally be other players. more on the family system later. \n\nCOUNTRIES AND AREAS\nif someone were born into a first-world country, like america or germany, schooling would be higher quality, job opportunities would be set according to the area in which you live, and hobbies would be more manufactured than crafted. if you were to be born into a third-world country, like togo or kazakhstan, schooling would provide less intellect, job choices would be limited, and hobbies would mostly be something that could be done for next to free. (i.e. soccer/football, weaving, etc.)\n\nEXCEPTIONS\nof course, some areas in third-world countries are higher-end, like cairo in egypt, as well as poorer areas in first-world countries, like inner-city chicago. jobs in these areas, though, are likely to be vastly different.\n\nCOLD HARD CASH\nin terms of money, it can be gained from working, inheritance, or other players. the biggest mechanics, obviously, would be inheritance and other players. more on inheritance in the family section. with money given by other players, a player could employ other real players to work for them, rather than working for the NPCs. it could also encourage illegal activities, like hiring a hitman or even money laundering. this would be an allowed mechanic, but the NPCs of the government and police department, as well as players working for them, can arrest you with sufficient proof of a crime. that brings me to the legal system.\n\nLEGAL SYSTEM\nin order to make the game more entertaining than real life, the legal system would be very basic, with only a few uses. one, to arrest both NPC and player criminals. two, to sue another player via an NPC law firm. three, to collect taxes relative to where you live. four, to employ players at an NPC law firm to defend other NPCs. and five, suing an NPC or NPC run business. pretty basic, and in places like outer islands or tiny villages, it would simply be a jury of villagers to convict you, considering you aren't killed on sight of a crime. that brings me to the life/death system.\n\nLIFE/DEATH SYSTEM a\nat birth, you either spawn with NPC parents or  at an orphanage. life goes quickly, so as to provide many experiences for the player. the entirety of childhood and schooling to high school would theoretically take about 50-60 minutes at most, giving around three minutes per year. this would be in an entirely different area than the adult years of the game, though it could be played with an online party of up to 4 through the whole schooling process. then, once schooling is done, you have the choice to join a public online server (which is what most of the player mechanics i suggested would be used for) or a private online or offline session.\n\nLIFE/DEATH SYSTEM Ia\nonline/offline private sessions are mostly run by NPCs. if played online, four players can participate in a private session, similar to schooling. however, only one player can be on an offline session. pretty simple. online public servers are almost always up, and progress is saved in a cloud drive for that particular server. (like rust) for offline/private, the files would be local so the server can only be accessed by the host pc when offline.\n\nLIFE/DEATH SYSTEM Ib\nonce schooling is over, the player is transported to a completely open world area where the adult portion of the game begins. here, every year is one hour. despite this, only two days pass in the hour relative to each year. a day is 15 minutes, and a night is 15 minutes. birthdays are set by the minute. for example, if the year in the newly joined online server was 19 minutes in from the beginning of the year, your birthday would simply be ""19."" every hour, on the 19th minute, you would age one year. depending on your health, the average life would last around 80 years. in certain circumstances, though, you could die at 20 or even live to be 110 or older. \n\nLIFE/DEATH SYSTEM Ic\ntypically, the open world is available as soon as you either drop out of school or graduate, but in some circumstances you can be held back in school, extending the time by another 3 minutes. another idea for schooling would just be a one-time tutorial before you can freely enter the primary world at 18.\n\nLIFE/DEATH SYSTEM II\nof course, playing the same life for 80-120 hours would get stale somewhat quickly. because of this, time would pass even when you aren't on the game. considering it takes you 30 hours to get back on the game after leaving at age 19, you would return at age 49. depending on your job, you will also receive a salary for every year you were gone. you will also spawn back in exactly where you left, so i wouldn't recommend leaving the game on a crosswalk.\n\nLIFE/DEATH SYSTEM III\nanother feature would be a bloodline. either with an NPC or player of the opposite gender, you can have a biological child. otherwise, you can simply adopt a child. ideally, a player's child could be taken over by a real player once the child reaches 18. this would allow for legacies that last hundreds or even thousands of years. with enough luck, a player could even be reborn as their own descendant after multiple generations.\n\nTHE LOWDOWN ON BUSINESS\nthere are various businesses that are essential for living, as well as recreational stores. restaurants, grocery stores, colleges and the like are completely run by NPCs, but players could be hired to work as a cashier, teacher, waiter/waitress, etc. recreational stores include game stores, which keeps your sanity attribute high, gun shops, which those filthy hitmen can purchase weapons from, and the like. players cannot work at these stores.\n\nDYING, RETIREMENT, AND TRAVEL\ntowards the end of a player's life, they can choose to take pension and retire, opening up more recreational opportunities. for example, if you have enough money, you could travel or even emigrate to another area. if you really wanted, you could do all of these ideas while you're still working. you could go to casinos, amusement parks, the movies, etc. additionally, a player can write his/her will if they have a family, choosing to distribute the money to either your children, your spouse, everyone, charity, or your family and charity.\n\nCONCLUSION \nthat essentially does it for my ideas right now, excluding some clearly available things like cars, planes, boats, real estate, fighting, etc. again, it's just a concept because i couldn't even begin to imagine creating this game. just thought it'd be cool to get this idea out there."
i7svva,CHARGE! - a flag bearer simulator,"CHARGE! is 2-D platformer where the player controls the flag or standard bearer in a historical (read it as old-timey) battle. As the flag bearer, the player inspires his soldiers and carries the momentum of battle but at great personal risk to his own life, as he becomes a priority target for the enemy. Your initial weapon is the flag itself but with glory points (earned by making kills with the flag), you can unlock other weapons to bring into the fight. Before the onset of each battle, you can choose your loadout and apply any upgrades you've earned from previous fights. The battle starts off far away and plays like an avoidance/dodge game as you have to dodge enemy fire, but as you charge into the enemy lines, the screen zooms and focuses in on you and your enemies' frontlines, until the game pretty much plays like a brawler/hack n' slash. The terrain is different across maps (procedurally generated?) and affects the speed of your advance (slower uphill, for instance) and what kind of cover (ex. shrubs, trees, boulders, battlefield wreckage) is available. Cover has to be used strategically because the longer you stay covered, the more likely you are to be pinned down and the resolve of your troops diminishes as they start taking on casualties.\n\nSome ideas of upgrades/weapons:\n\n* Flag size upgrade = slows your movement speed but increases the amount of glory earned as you run.\n* Brighter colors = same as flag size upgrade but no penalty on speed. Much more glory cost however.\n* Spear point = Upgrades the point on the end of your flag pole to various spear/bayonet-like type weapons.\n*  Sidearm/secondary weapon = If your flag is small enough, you may carry a sidearm/secondary weapon to help deal with tougher foes at the front\n* Back harness (very expensive) = allows you to carry the flag with free hands (allows you to equip a two-handed secondary weapon). Glory earned only from running however, since not having the flag in hand means you can't make flag kills.\n* Bounce = faster recovery when thrown by an explosion\n* Mounts (e.g. horse) = faster movement speed but makes you a bigger target. You can also be thrown off your mount if the mount is shot or spooked by an explosion. Mounts may be upgradeable and may have their own mini-skill tree.\n* Upgrades for thrust, slash, crush/bludge attacks with flag.\n\nFor controls, I'm thinking of arrow keys for movement and letter keys for fighting combos."

i7h0j8,A permadeath game about rebels.,"Just had an idea for a game where you play as a series of rebels. Each character is permadeath and specific to the level.\n\nIf you die, that mission is over and based on how far you got, what objectives were completed and how many rebels were left alive the end status of the mission is determined. From there its onward down the line of rebels you play as. \n\nThe endings of each mission can effect later missions, and all together effect the end of the story. It's possible to die immediately in each mission and get the worst ending possible after only 5 minutes. It's also possible to survive each mission and have a bunch of rebel heroes to inspire other people to join the rebellion, making future missions easier. \n\nFor example I'm imagining a 2 part mission where you need to go in stealth and sabotage a base before a large assault. Phase 1 objectives are 1) cut the power to cripple base defenses, 2) kill the base commander to disorganize the troops, and 3) blow weapons cache to prevent resupply, cause chaos and signal the start of the attack. These can be tackled in any order but it would have consequences. \n\nCutting the power before killing the commander allows for easier movement through the base but puts everyone on alert and power is restored in a few minutes. Killing the commander first means having to get to him without being seen but there is more chaos/confusion when the power is cut and it takes much longer to restore. Blowing the cache first ends the mission and signals the assault team to move in while the base defenses are hot and the troops are organized and ready with leadership from their command. \n\nAlerting anyone during the stealth phase is almost surely a death sentence. Depending which objectives where completed before death affects what you have to deal with on the assault. There is also the option to call off the assault if you no longer think its feasible. It will save the rebels from a morale hit from the casualties of a failed assault but will make a future mission harder with reinforcements from this base. \n\nI imagine a limited number of missions that max out at about a half our long on a successful play-through. If the game could be completed in about 3 hours I think it would be compelling to play through the whole thing multiple time to do better and explore unintended consequences of mission outcomes."
iestm7,Game I was thinking of,"(Warning: this post is very long)\n\nHi, I'm thinking of some sort of shoot'em'up, similar to far cry, based in Mexico with the character helping a Mexican drug cartel take back their secluded village and mountainous region from the triads and (enter drug gang here. It will feature story missions as well and random encounter that gain/lose your cartel land depending on their outcome. Your cartels loyalty to you will be affected by gaining /losing land, meaning that you may be facing three enemies instead of two if your doing poorly. I had a couple levels planned out with some Interesting quirks, as well as a general sense of the storyline. I'd like to quickly run over my ideas, and hopefully you can provide me with feedback and/or ideas. The game has three acts (two missions I have planned, and the beginning story I have thought about) (this is no-where near a completed game idea, many levels and much story is missing)\n\nStory: Game opens with your small criminal group under heavy fire from cops. A new drug group see their opurtunity for growth, and decide to help you escape, in return for you merging with them under a common leader. This leader is an old but charismatic man, with a thick Mexican accent, who knows how to get his way. Your placed as one of the luitenants under him, and are tasked with coordinating attacks on other criminal enterprises, in the effort of growth, money, and power.\n\nMission 1: Horsemen of the apocalypse\n\nTo deliver drugs to a heavy investor in your cartel, you must travel through a canyon that separates your  hidden tropical paradise from the rest of the world. The only catch is that it's heavily fortified by the local military, with blockades and machine gun positions set up to discourage anyone from moving through it. The player must build a car using a selection of parts (Rams, explosives, weapons Ect.) to break through the blockades, assisting large truck filled with explosive methamphetamine through the crossing. The level ends with your leader betraying you and his other luitenants, seeing you as a hindrence for his plans of rapid expansion and eventually world domination. Most of the luitenants are executed, however, you and a small number get away, after you fire a bullet into one of the meth trucks, creating a large explosion that scolds the back of the leader and give you a window of opportunity for escape. This level is meant to be explosive, action-packed, and a great conclusion to the first act of the game. It sets up a clear villain, and provides you with a sense of character for the other luitenants who escape (a d eventually become sub-villians).\n\n(At this point I don't really know the story, but basically what happens is you realise the leader outnumbers you, and decide to try and get the military involved with taking him down, providing a distraction while you land crippling blows to his cartel)\n\nMission 2: Swaying public opinion\n\nThis mission sees you climbing a mountain to a leader controlled  nuclear facility, in the hope of setting off an explosion that will expose the existence and danger that he poses, and eventually getting the military involved. While you climb the mountain, Gale winds pick up, throwing bullets astray, and eventually, flinging guns out of your hands. Near the top of the mountain, old medieval ruins provide the player with maces, axes and other primitive weaponry, urging the player kill enemies in a much closer range. This level is the end of the second act, and sets the path for the leaders cartel defeat.\n\nAfter this I don't know anything about what the game would be\n\nIf you make something based off this, please credit me. Also, a copy of the game would be nice!"
iesj44,Post apocalyptic Multiplayer Game,"I dreamt up this idea of a game where the world has pretty much been destroyed by nuclear warfare, this concept has many opportunities to provide a brilliant single player experience similar to the fallout series but with more of a focus on the gunplay.\n\nFor the Multiplayer aspect I imagine a very large map but not the size of a battle royale map, where 20 players are locked in the map together. However, because this is post-nuclear warfare you spawn with a oxygen mask that has enough oxygen for 5 mins. After that 5 mins, 15 new oxygen masks will spawn throughout the map, so this could lead to some tense moments where you are fighting someone off whilst making sure you grab that oxygen mask. Every time oxygen masks spawn the fewer of them there will be for example after the first 5 mins there will be 15 masks but the second time only 10.\n\nThis would require players to strategise more instead of just going in guns blazing. Of course that is an option but perhaps not the best.\n\nYou could also adapt this idea into space instead of a post apocalyptic earth. Hell you could even have both.\n\nI have no idea for a third mode.\n\nIf anyone would like to use this idea keep me updated on ur progress with it."
ieq0oj,VR PVP Sword Fighting Game with a mix of mechanics between Until You Fall and Swords of Gargantua,"Basically what im imagining is a  combat system for pvp sword fighting with almost scripted like blocking.  As in, when you swing the sword an indicator will come up for the other player to block and depending on how clean the block is and the way the sword is used to block will give a certain response and possibly break your guard or damage you slightly.  When I say break your guard think like push your sword back or break it with a time to regenerate like in sword of Gargantua. I think the combination of those two systems could possibly give a much better feeling sword fighting experience."
iepvh2,Better filter of curse words in chat,"Hello everyone. I will start by saying that this really isn't a ""game mechanic"" per say, but it could help make the game itself funer. So I honestly can't stand when games cencor out certain words in the text chat. And some people will complain the other way around. That things should be censored. So why not have a system where each individual player sets what words he or she doesn't want to read. So for example, lets say I really hated the word ""moist"" I could tell the game to replace it with ""****"" or to replace it with a custom word. A player might even be able to hide messages that contain something that they didn't like to see. It would all be customizable. Now you wouldn't have to type out every single word that you didn't want to read. You could select from a premade template. For example, ""block out words that aren't TV friendly"" ""Only block F-words"" or something like, ""Show no messages that contain any bad words."" This could make parents more comfortable letting their kids play a game."
iejfod,Game about the right choice in randomly generated situations with battle-royale mechanic,"Hi, sorry for my English. I have the crazy idea about battle royale game in pretty unusual format - something like visual novel in randomly-generated story with situations where the players should make the right choice based on their characters traits. I see it like party of the heroes go to epic dangerous adventure -&gt; players create their characters and select traits -&gt; the game generates some story and has ""levels"" that  contains with different situations where players should select one of the options based on their traits. For example ""the players see an huge ogr, what will you do?"", the character with body-strong feature could have chances in the battle but character with ""stealt"" feature could try to hide and etc. With the wrong choice the player is eliminated, in the process situations become more complicated and only one player remains. What do you think about it?"
iei7il,Cowboys guiding a herd of cows 🤠🐮,"Had this idea before falling asleep last night and since I am free for the next 2 weeks I would like to develop a game around this idea. I need your ideas too.\n\n*General Idea*\nI thought about a couch coop game where players need to go from a checkpoint to another. Cowboys need to avoid their cows to go into obstacles (snakes, holes, cacti, etc.) and die. They make money depending on how many animals they were able to bring to the checkpoint. W ith the money, they can buy upgrades like a better horse. Also, I thought the herd could get bigger at each checkpoint.\n\n*The map*\nProcedural map generation with mountains, trees, rivers, etc. Cows and players would move on x &amp; z axis, not y.\n\n*The herd*\nThe herd would move like a bird flock (Separation - avoid crowding cows, Alignment - steer towards average heading of cows, Cohesion - steer towards average position of cows). If the herd is not managed correctly, some cows may go on another direction.\n\n*Lose the game*\nWhen the players lost x cows, they lose.\n\n*Obstacles*\nCacti, snakes, rivers, trains, bandits, cliffs... \n\n*Upgrades*\nI need idea for what the players can upgrade at each checkpoint.\n\nIf you have any ideas, feel free to comment!"
ieghok,A VR game where the lead character is in a wheelchair,"Instead of teleporting or slingshoting around I always thought it would be interesting to make a feature of being in a chair instead of working round it, an electric chair that can be operated with a joystick. This would probably lend itself more to a 'walking' simulator with investigation and puzzle solving as main ways of progression but someone more creative might come up with a better alternative.\n\nI know it's a bit vague but I thought it was an interesting concept and might seed some inspiration"
ieet26,Any ideas for a game where psychology and mental health awareness meets RPG and/or platform?,Good morning/evening everyone.\n\nSo I am trying to get some ideas regarding a game where psychology and mental health awareness are the main factors. I have an MSc in Psychology and I have been a gamer for quite some time  but I haven't come across a game where they clearly raise awareness about mental health. I believe it would be a good idea and hopefully it would offer some help to those struggling in these exceptional times.\n\nThank you very much
iecxsy,A gacha game where all of the characters are really awful childrens drawings,Im not really sure what else to add to explain it further. If you have played any of those gacha games you would know they basically boil down to collecting anime jpgs. The only difference from this one would be that all of the characters you use would be poorly made drawings by children.
iea6cg,Multiplayer animal simulation game,"Using real life species, you can now become any type of animal you want. Each animal has their real life pros and cons.

There is probably tons of games like this but not exactly.  Tell me what game if there is."
ie9f82,What happened with this?,"A few days ago I remembered about a game I used to play on browsers, I remembered how I tried everything I could to play it again but it wasn’t possible anymore, and I had the idea to search any info about it on Reddit, and I stumbled upon with a post in this sub which said:\n\n“You Are The Road\n\nCan anyone on this sub recreate the old web game called, “You Are The Road”??? I used to absolutely love this game. \n\nIf anyone remembers this game, I’m sure you know what I mean. It was a game where you controlled the road, and there was about 8 or so cars racing each other. You could control the turns, bumps, jumps, drops, etc. and could drop boxes in front of the cars to throw them off.\n\nA remake of this game would be awesome, especially if you could do it with some sort of an “upgrade game” twist to it. Give this game a look on YouTube if you haven’t seen it.”\n\nThis post was made by u/Wack-Zilson (I don’t know, I thought I should give him credit or something), and some people said they could make the idea of a remake possible, and I asked for someone to help me follow up with the project (to see if I can play it), but no one responded because the post was made 139 days ago. \nSo can someone please tell me about if the project was worked on or something?"
ie9316,Outdoor Stealth Tactical Multiplayer FPS," \n\nI had an idea for a FPS set in outdoor environments like forests or deserts with a big focus on camouflage. There would be separate attacking / defending sides with the defenders taking up defensive positions along paths with the attackers having to spot them. I'm not sure what the objective would be, might be similar to a defuse game mode?\n\nSound would play a big part in the game as guns would deal a ton of damage which promotes a stealth play style. There would be more advanced movement options in this game to allow players to minimise noise like walking on the side of your boots which is slower than normal walking but makes less noise, or leopard crawling to maintain a low profile.\n\nThe game would have an economy system with both sides being able to purchase upgrades like binoculars that can see longer range or longer range scopes, suppressors and other weapon upgrades. The most powerful / costly upgrade would be a heat-sensing scope. There would be smoke &amp; impact grenades but these would be expensive to offset their effectiveness. \n\nPlayers could also set traps such as tripwires, pitfall traps &amp; motion detectors. \n\nCamouflage would be an upgrade too with the final tier being difficult to spot with leaves &amp; foliage covering the entire gun &amp; player. There would be no micro-transaction skins as this would make the game unbalanced."
ie585u,A sentient test subject dealing with madness,"Hi guys! This is my first post here. \nWhile writing up concepts for a short indie game. \nI have been considering making one based off one of the people in it.\n\nIn this also relatively short game you play as an alien who was captured by an empire to be made into what is essentially an undead soldier, the head researcher discovers you aren’t deceased and attempts to release you. \n\nThis game will take place either near the end or after your rampage through site 88 apart from the head researcher you will be mainly talking to yourself, or more specifically your past selves trying to piece together what happened and why. \n\nThe cast:\nRel : the protagonist early life where he was part of \nsome religious orginisation, superstitious though level headed but a bit too trusting. He wears a dark yellow scarf and has some paint covering his face \n\nCon: the protagonists younger self where he was a child soldier, cold paranoid and very prone to panic. He wears a pillow case with holes cut in it \n\nPre:the protagonist some point before his labatomistation, emotionless, pessimismstic suffering from ptsd and constantly attempting (but mostly failing) to remember what happened. He wears the same scarf but has sunken in eyes and paler skin \n\nNit: the protagonists unknown mental illness embodies as a tall out of proportion creature with coal like objects for eyes and a white hole for a mouth.\n\nIsn’t his game your goal is to carry out the researchers last wish while trying to avoid hostiles, completely losing it or failing to accomplish a certain objective. \n\nStill thinking of a name for this one though"

Resources are scare, and supply lines are critical to keeping colonists and bandits alike well supplied. Trips back and forth, reveiling many challenges and stumbling blocks. The character are unique and handpicked, Rimworld would be a decent example. This would be a rougelite, as to add progression to runs and size of train and it's car capacity. Picture part of the train a version of x-com's command center, without all the annoying timers. To traveler further and progress into better tech trees, successful runs and loses are common place. Keep well liked engineers, vagabonds, scientists etc, in the command center, which can be upgraded to become a bunker of sorts for favorite loot and player safety, those with less rank or preference will fill the more formidable jobs. Already a wall of text, sorry. I could go on forever."

idyh5q,Legacy of the Warrior: Office of Legend,"I like the idea of a game that can show off the legacy of a legendary warrior.  The spirit of this same legendary warrior travels from person to person throughout history.  He's fighting on the moors of Scotland with a claymore, he's riding on a horse and firing arrows in Medieval China, he's in a Greek Phalanx, he's swinging from the mast in a great sea battle, he's making copies on the 14th floor of an office building?\n\nThroughout history, this legendary spirit has always been where it needs to be, and through some mistake (or maybe not) it has inhabited an office worker.  The game starts as a simple office simulation game.  You have a stamina bar but maybe we'll call it a focus bar.  You have a 9-5 schedule that you fill completing tasks at your computer, phone calls, copies, working with various other workers, and conference room meetings.  You regain focus by getting coffee (increases your speed temporarily also, but you move slower once it wears off), bathroom breaks, or smoke breaks (reduces health - why do you need health?).  \n\nWhen you leave at the end of the day you get paid, level up, etc. and when you do that, you can get a promotion and move up to another floor.  The company itself also becomes more profitable and the stock goes up, and pretty quickly you find out someone is attempting a hostile takeover.  \n\nAs the hostile takeovers occur, you have to continue to complete your business tasks, but you also have various historical enemies coming into the office and attacking you and your coworkers and you have to fight them off.  Do you finish your phone call or throw a spear at the Roman Centurion harassing accounting?"
idxo7c,A browser-based game where you compose your own units?,"I there any game in the style of OGame where you can compose your own units by attaching engines, weapons, power sources, etc?\n\nThe idea is to use sockets that define the rules how those components can be mounted. These components will affect the properties of the ship, such as weight, thrust power, fire power, etc. I thought about using graphs and curves to define the working regime of each component and use a node composer (like blender nodes). This could lead to complexity explosion and very flexible ways of optimizing your units for the envisioned task.\n\nThe idea is for player to craft their units as blueprints and sell them or produce them at a factory. I have other innovative ideas on how players can even create their own components and sell them, but I cannot disclose this information, since I'm pretty sure it doesn't exists and it's a complete game changer."
idvnrj,Ideas for a Point-and-Click Adventure Game,"I've just discovered this subreddit and hoping I can find some help.\n\nI have recently been inspired to make a Point-and-Click Adventure Game. I'm a huge fun of the genre, especially the Lucas Arts classics of the 90s (Sam &amp; Max, Day of the Tentacle, Full Throttle, etc.)\n\nI have started prototyping the game play. Its third person, where you can walk around, collect items, interact with NPCs. I'd like to incorporate some self-contained puzzles as well as some larger task-based puzzles (a la Resident Evil). I like the idea of having a primary controllable character, with a secondary character who can perform certain actions (a la Sam &amp; Max).\n\nMy original idea was to base the game in a small town where you can explore the various buildings. However, I fall short at plot ideas and how to incorporate puzzles.\n\nI thought about writing a murder mystery. But I wasn't sure how to work puzzles in to that idea and I also wanted to keep the story light and humorous.\n\nAnother idea was for a wealthy relative to pass away, where you have to solve puzzles to access your inheritance. But I struggled to work this in to the small town idea.\n\nAny suggestions, ideas or inspirations would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks"
idtfhh,A medieval city builder with grand strategy elements,"There already are plenty of good City builder games like Cities Skylines, the Ceasar series, and Banished. \n\nBut when i play those games, i always miss something. Interaction. That my city in the world matters. \n\nIt's like i'm building the only city on earth, and all the resources are available to me on the very same map.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would like to see a city builder with three elements. \n\n1. The city building itself.\n\n2. A map, where your place in the world matters.\n\n3. City Focus, something your city excels in based on the resources available.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe City Building\n\nPretty straightforward, graphics like Banished would be amazing, but something like Ceasar 3 isn't the end of the world.\n\nwhat i really would like to see is trade carts and (big) ships coming in to your city, and local farmers driving their cattle to your markets. You have to build markets and inn's for your travelers. A city that feels alive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Map\n\nThe map is a secondary view. with rivers, trade-roads,  sea's, and other city's (displayed by an icon).\n\nYou begin with choosing a place on a map where you want to build your city. \n\nYou can choose a place on the end of a river with great trade connections, or up in the hills where there are more resources, but has only a single trade-road.\n\nIf you are at the river, you probably have fertile ground, but no iron-ore or coal. And wood is pretty scarce.\n\nSo on the ""map view"" you must make trade routes for the missing items. In the beginning you can only trade with nearby neighbors, but as upgrade you can make bigger ships and trade carts, and send them around the whole map.\n\nAnd off course, you must have something to trade....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCity Focus\n\nAnybody can make wine, but Bordeaux wine is something special. Making cheese? easy. But Parmesan cheese is famous around the world. In medieval times the fabrics from Ieper were outstanding, were sold all over europe and they even build the fabrics Guild, and the ""Lakenhalle van Ieper"".\n\nThat's what i want to do, based on the resources available i want to make my city excel at something. \n\nI would take some effort, upgrades and research. But then you have a product that you can trade around the map, and bring wealth and beautifull buildings to your city.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you for reading, i understand that probably [http://yourgameideaistoobig.com/](http://yourgameideaistoobig.com/). \n\nIn my mind the game is a combination of Banished/City Skylines and Crusader Kings 2. With a pretty extensive market system. Something only a game studio like Paradox could make. \n\nBut banished was made by an indie developer, so maaaaayybe there is a change someone gets inspired......\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nps. please excuse the grammar errors, english isn't my native language."

You are a warrior who is fighting in a war between 4 empires and you can choose which empire you want to fight for. The map will be based on the Geography of China which features Deserts, Mountains, Bamboo Forests, etc.\n\nTo progress in the game, you would need to kill monsters and other mythological creatures which would unlock weapons and powers that is needed to fight other players. The questing system is story driven and you can grow your empire by conquering lands and fighting battles, similar to EVE Online. \n\nThe Economy will be player run, have a mix of merchants and stores, and will not include an auction house. It will also be a Supply and Demand economy which will have an interface that will allow players to monitor it.\n\nAs for playing the game, It will be a Subscription Model that you will pay for 6 Months and if it becomes popular enough, will have a free to play option."

id75ek,A team based (very team based) 2d shooter in a randomly generated destructible environment,"This game idea is a multiplayer 2d shooter game where matches take place in a randomly generated building that is completely destructible, like teardown but 2d (search it up if you don’t know what I’m talking about). The game is heavily team based, with every team being made of these five classes:\n\n\nSapper: Can build planks, place mines and turrets. This class has access to smgs. This class specialises at controlling where the enemy goes, forcing them out of areas with turrets and incendiary grenades.\n\nRecon: Has access to drones, and can use sniper rifles and marksman rifles. Also has a zoom in and out ability. This class may not even enter the building in most matches. Instead, they stalk the building from the outside, and survey the area with their drones, giving crucial info to the team.\n\nBreacher: Can use shotguns and has a sledgehammer. Also has a shield. This class is the vanguard of the team, busting down doors and using the shield to cover the team.\n\nAssault: Can use assault rifles and marksman rifles. These do the most damage. If the breacher created openings, this class exploits them.\n\nMedic: Can heal other players and has access to smgs. This class runs around looking for injured players to heal. With little offensive capability, this class must be protected at all times.\n\nIn terms of how the game is played, there are three modes to play:\n\nDefuse - Infinite respawns.

If all terrorists are killed, the counters win.\n\nClear - 1 life only. The counters must kill all terrorists to win and the terrorists must kill all counters to win.\n\nSearch - Counters have 3 lives, terrorists have infinite.

If all the counters are dead, the terrorists win.\n\nThe terrorists will start in the building and the counters will start outside.\n\nAs for the aesthetic of this game, it would be made of pixels, like teardown, and have a similar art style to dead cells (but maybe not as high resolution)."

ibzkhp,"Dark souls in space! I know it’s been done recently, but I had some lore I wanted to build the game around...","The premise is, the year is XXXX in the future, technology has gone leaps and bounds, producing cyber enhancements, near-perfect cloning, “efficient” space travel, but has been stuck at a standstill. \n\nEarth has been swamped in ruin and filth over years of neglect and over monopolistic corporations green and influence. This has driven corporations to drive humanity to further reaches to sustain their near insatiable greed, sending out colonial ships into the skies. These ships were sent to find new homes on planets, begin new star stations, and to explore further than what humanity would find on earth. With great success humanity is one with the void it set to conquer, but with some issues.\n\nThere always had to be a first generation of cloning machines, ships and a first generation to venture out on a trip. One ship in particular which was lost to the darkest beyond, never to be heard from again. Until one day, a distress beacon is found in the shortest burst. \n\nYou play as a clone of “The Engineer”, a near-perfect clone with an imprint of information on every ship created to date. Your purpose is to be sent from your spawn station to assist any ship with a distress beacon, and it turns out you’re the only clone to ever be sent to this ship.\n\nSo the idea goes that you crash land on the ship, and immediately get splattered, but as a near-perfect clone, you get re-cloned but infested with the old ships corrupted cloning systems, and come back as “verged”. Slowly with each death you become as corrupted as the residents on the old colonial ship you landed on. \n\nThe idea revolves with that being stuck in space with being near immortal on a corrupted cloning machine would cause some kinda issues with citizens over time, like I had an idea of one boss being a DJ who merged with his DJ table because of his cybernetic enhancements? But I’d have no idea how that’d work out!\n\nIf anyone likes it just give some input or feedback and see where it goes!"

ibqnhb,CaRPG/Decade System,"An open world racing game that starts out in the 90s in high school and ends in modern day. The game would have 4 sections each happening 10 years apart.  It would be all about progression and you would only have access to cars available at that time period/location. \n\nSecondly, if it had more of an rpg element where you could talk to NPCs and make decisions that would change things 10-30 years later. Cars would also depreciate and appreciate over each time span, so certain investments may pay off later, or you may lose money on a certain purchase. \n\nThose are the basic elements, though I have thought more in depth about this game, but I think this would be a new spin on car games. Some of these ideas might translate into other games as well, but the modern racing games are getting stale."
ibqk50,"A free 3 way elimination fighting game which takes place in the future, 3 semi large robots named titans (not related to titanfall) fight in a medium sized arena against each other","This has been in my mind for a while and its seems like it would work as an actual game. The game would take place in the year 2145, after a war on earth ravaged the world and left it in ruins, forcing colonization to on mars. After its terraforming, earth was is now a wasteland where people just run blood sports and what not. In one of these blood sports would be one named annihilation. \n\nThe game would focus on being the last if the three alive by the end of a round. To win the whole match you must win two rounds. However players dont simply have health... they have armor covering there bodies and to take an opponent out, you must deal as much damage as possible during a fight. Once enough has been dealt, they will lose both armor and body parts. Once a players is on like one arm left, crawling to attack they can be finished with some kind  of animation which will give you extra health to finish off the other person. If a player loses all there armor, they can take enough damage to the head and die.\n\nThere are Five playable titans in the game with unique abilities, as the game progresses there will be more titans and maps to play.\n\n𝘛𝘩𝘦 𝘵𝘪𝘵𝘢𝘯𝘴\n\n-BLUE MOON\nThe icon of the game, this guy used to be a construction unit until the war, where the construction units were reprogrammed to be fighters due to the weight they can carry and take.

ibixqw,Community Driven Text Adventure.,"The idea for this game is heavily inspired by the now defunct Elemental3 game created by Carykh, so if you want to get an idea of what I'm talking about, look at that first. This would be an online game, possibly written with html5.\n\nThe idea is that, for simplicity sakes, there is nothing but a text box. In the box you can type actions which will autocomplete according to if they have an outcome. If they don't have an outcome, then after pressing enter you will receive the message ""Nothing happened when you tried to do that.""\n\nAfter this, a board will pop up, showing you the most popular suggestions for what the resulting text should say. This board will also be an option to click on after any action. On the board you can choose to vote on a suggested outcome or write your own. Once any suggestion gets more than 10 votes it will be implemented, and from then on the most popular idea will be implemented.\n\nEvery outcome in the game has a number attached to it. When you create a new outcome, you can choose to link it to a previous outcome that will have all the same possible actions and resulting outcomes, as well as any other the player adds to the linked action. This is to simplify the process of making a player return to the same place or situation. Players can still add more actions if the suggestion gets enough votes, or write a new outcome to one of the actions linked, but these changes will only apply to the new outcome and not the one that was linked to it. Hovering over a number will let voters see what action it is linked to. To attach a link, just type the number in brackets along with the text for the outcome, for example ""the door slowly opens \[157\]""\n\nOnce you have done this, you will be returned back to where you were in the text adventure to try something else. Each path is unique and the entire game's story and structure would be player and community driven. You could restart just by refreshing the page, and the voting system could be prevent double voting with IP verification."

ib4w5q,An open world game that combines a traditional superhero game with GTA like gameplay.,"We have seen open world video games about characters like Batman and Spider-Man, but I feel the superhero video game genre could break some new ground with a character that could follow the traditional hero route or than of an antihero. \n\nThere is a duality aspect similar to Spider-Man web of shadows in which the protagonist is able to make choices typical of a traditional hero, or of an anti hero. These choices will determine which missions the protagonist will be able to access and the approach to certain missions. If you choose a more heroic route, you will gain more allies to help you in your fight against crime for team up situations, like in Batman Arkham Knight. Choosing the antihero route means you have less allies but you are equipped with more lethal weapons. You equip live rounds instead of rubber bullets for example. The hand to hand combat is reminiscent of the Arkham series but it has its own qualities which make it unique. At times there are weapons lying around like crowbars, knives, baseball bats, broken bottles which you are able to pick up temporarily to inflict larger damage on your enemy, but it limits mobility as well. You can also equip Kali sticks, stun guns, shurikens, and more for permanent use. The bad path allows for lethal force and the use of firearms for finishes in combat as well as explosives. When in antihero mode the game becomes slightly more challenging but combat become more efficient due to the protagonist not holding back against his enemies. The stealth sections are largely the same within both the good and bad paths. One main difference is that the good path has you knock out the targets from behind when in the bad path you kill them with a knife or a silenced pistol. The bad path also includes more gunfights similar to the GTA series in which an area must be cleared out. There is also a game mechanic involving painkillers similar to Max Payne 3. In the good path it replenishes your health completely(it can do so in small increments when finishing parts of a stage) while in the bad path it makes you completely invulnerable to all attacks for a limited amount of time. \n\nThe main character has a sidekick who works from a secret base by hacking into machines and security systems. At times you control him by scoping out locations and finding out information and then communicating it to main protagonist. His gameplay is based around hacking puzzles and observation. \n\nThe main character is also friends with a police detective who helps him investigate and analyze crime scenes. His gameplay is based around puzzles and investigation. \n\n\nThe main character works as a anesthesiologist doctor in a hospital which is used to further the plot. Frequently injured gang members are taken to the hospital and they hold valuable information about current events. Security cameras are disabled and then main protagonist sneaks into rooms to interrogate the patients. This can lead to mandatory missions or they can be optional interrogations that give leads to side missions. There is also puzzle gameplay used that reflects the life of a anesthesiologists in a hospital. You can create formulas that can be taken for use as first aid later in the story to help out wounded civilians in missions. \n\nThere is an open world free roam aspect to the game as well. During certain missions criminals will need to be chased down with your car. You can choose to deploy road spikes and disable their car or you can choose to shoot at their car. \nThere will be criminals camped out all over the city for side missions in which you can choose to apprehend them. You can either simply leave them for the police or you can choose to kill them. The more good or bad choices you make you fill a corresponding bar. Being good puts you on the right side of the law while being bad does the opposite. Having cops on your side allows them to assist you in certain missions and having them against you makes them another target in the mission which you cannot kill. After killing criminals in side missions you may have to lose the police by hiding around in the city and laying low. You can’t harm any police officers or civilians when in the open world regardless of which path you pick. Outside of petty crime side missions there are also territories which are dominated by gangs that not even cops go to. In these designated territories you can accumulate a gang wanted level(like Saints Row 2) by killing gang members. These territories have different side missions in which you either infiltrate hideouts or clear the streets of waves of criminals. Doing all of these side missions results in these areas being ridden of these gangs completely(like San Andreas). \n\nSorry for the bad formatting. What do you think?"

iidzay,I hate getting caught in the rain,"So it would be a horror game, and you'd be in a zombie apocalypse type scenario that takes place after a chemical war between America and russia. Theres only you and a handful of survivors left, and you're held up in a weak, rundown building. The rain has become toxic due to the chemicals from the war, which is what has created the zombies you're hiding from. During a night of heavy rain you try to avoid the weak spots in the roof, watching as your fellow survivors fall to the rain as it pours through the weak roof. If you get caught you fall to your knees in a 1st person pov and only see the shadow of your corpse rising before the game over screen appears. If you manage to survive you grab a gun loaded with 5 bullets. As you pick it up, the sounds of hordes of zombies approaching becomes louder and closer until you can hear them banging on the walls. The game ends when one of them manages to get their hand through the wall.\nThis is my first post but I thought it would be cool as a game."
iiarv7,A game idea that would take a huge team and resources I just don’t have... It would be awesome to make it though.,"Game idea:\n\n- RPG (3rd person)\n- Single Play, Local Co-op, and/or MMO\n\n- Character: Non-Static Customizable looks. Actions taken determine personality, mentality, etc. Starts off as an infant (super fast progression to adulthood). Starting traits are determined from selected parent(s) personality traits. Character is controllable from 18 years old.\n\n- World: Much like earth in the beginning portions of the game until character progresses to being able to flip between physical and spirit realms.\n\n- Gameplay: Death is possible in the Physical realms unless you flip to the spirit realm before death. Spirit realms can be used for fast travel, healing, gaining knowledge, escaping complicated battles, creating objects/items, home, vehicles, etc. (sandbox) that can be brought back to the physical realms. Fast travel can be anywhere in the Galaxy (ideally). If you re-enter the physical realms in a bad spot (space) you will die (unless you make a space suit for the character in the spirit realms). If you come back into the physical realms in front of a undeveloped civilization they may look at you as if you are a god... or an enemy). Entering in front of developed civilizations will more often have you attacked than seen as a god.\n\nDifficulty: There are many levels of difficulty in the spirit realms. The way you can get there is by ""descending"" manually or by being ""bad"" in the physical realms. The more descended the more complicated. If you die in the Spirit Realms you lose, flipping to the physical realms does not save you. If you are bad and you flip to the spirit realm to save yourself, you could end up fighting really powerful enemies and dying in the spirit realms instead. (Gives more incentive to be good). The physical realms have difficulties assigned by planet and choices. If you are bad and you fight with a developed civilization, gameplay will be incredibly difficult. If you are good and you don't fight, you can explore instead. (Unless the fight is brought to you).\n\n- Perks: You can learn magic and other supernatural abilities in the spirit realms. If you make a lightsaber (equivalent) in the spirit realms and bring it into the physical realms, you can start down a jedi/sith type path and do what you will with it (example). In the physical realms you can get a job (even spaceship design/building) and have that built by many people, or you can just build it solo in the Spirit Realms and bring it into the physical realms. Physical builds are not customizable.\n\n- Building: Custom ""polygonal level"" design capabilities would have to be incorporated so players can build unique objects/structures/vehicles/weapons/armor. Usually triangular shapes will allow for this. It would basically be a 3D modeling software in the spirit realms. There would be pre-prepared objects like coffee cups, chairs, door handles/doors, lights, etc... the polygonal design is ideally to be used for creating the body/inside layout of a ship, house, plane, etc...\n\n- Winning: Either, take over the entire galaxy (physical), kill all humans (physical), create/keep peace throughout the entire galaxy (physical), destroy the final mega boss in the hardest level of the spirt realms, destroy the final mega boss in the neutral region of the spirit realms (god - alot of strategy needed here to accomplish this without ending up descended - the ultimate hardest achievement), or learn (character reading in the spirit realms) everything in the game and try everything learned at least once in the physical realms (ascension is possible and a way to win)."
iiae2b,Looking for a good Hide and seek type of game idea,Does anyone have a good idea for a game a bit like SpyParty?
ii9s3m,A game where you make the Codex of item and enemy information,"#Core\n\nThe player character is the one responsible for creating the “Codex” for the game. They must use logic and the tools at their disposal to measure the different stats of items and enemies throughout the game world. Completion of the codex is the end goal of the game.\n\n\n####Genres\n\nThe game would work in either a fantasy setting or a space-faring setting. \n\nIn the fantasy setting, the player controls a golem created by a magic council with the goal of creating a centralized repository of knowledge of the outside world. The player would be rewarded directly throughout the game with the ability to control more about their stats and access to more accurate measuring tools.\n\nIn the space-faring setting, the player is an android tasked by the corporations to create a database differentiating all of the modular spaceship parts. This one would have more of a focus on truth vs corruption, as the rewards for falsifying information in the database in favor of specific corporations would be greater than the base rewards. \n\n####Mechanical intricacies\n\nAt the start of the game, you would be given the stats of exactly 1 item and 1 enemy. From there you must calculate the stats of every other object in the game. As the game goes on, some stats may expand in scope, such as basic weapon damage splitting into different damage types, such as piercing and blunt, with different scaling calculations. These would be automatically updated on the starting item and enemy, and you be able to use this new knowledge to calculate these stats on the rest of your items.\n\nCarrying capacity and overall storage will be one of the more common rewards, as sometimes you may get items that you either cannot use at the moment or that you cannot measure well in the current stage of the game.\n\nExamples of measuring tools:\n\n-	Log (records most recent damage numbers. Can be increased in length)\n-	Scale (reports weight of item. Increases in both capacity and precision)\n-	Resistance meter (measures amount that damage is reduced to calculate different damage types)\n-	Calculator (just allows you to calculate in game. Upgrades to allow import and export of numbers to and from codex)\n-	Scope (shows enemy info in battle. Begins with just health bar, upgrades to percentage and finally shows existing codex info as well.\n\n####Character\n\nThe player character would begin with a 1 in all basic stats, and would be rewarded throughout the game with the ability to increase it higher and in smaller increments. For example, first upgrade would let you choose between 1 or 10 for a stat, and next would allow of 5, 15, and 20 as well. This way they can be more precise with their measurements while still allowing for character progression.\n\n####Side Content\n\nWhile the main goal of the game would be the completion of the codex, there would be side content in the game to reward the player with money,easier access to rare items, shortcuts between locations, hints about certain item or enemy stats, or even powerful tools or upgrades to make filling the codex easier.\n\nMoney should not be something provided through filling the codex, so it is up to the player to gather it either through item collecting and trading or quests from NPCs\n\n___\n\nThis concept would definitely not appeal to mainstream audiences, but I think there would still be enough of a niche market who would enjoy this. Please let me know what you all think."

I’ve never played a game like this so it might be too boring to work. \n\nSo you start the game as a newborn. Everything is black and white and you can only see very close things. You crawl around and either over time or by pick ups you age. You grow into a child and can walk and jump, and then as you grow, you begin to see colors. The colors are very bright and pretty during toddler age. With this though you see scary monsters, darkness comes after you (things that scare kids). If they get you, you lose. No fighting back at this age. Once you reach teen you can find power ups which would be like double jump or wall jumps or other cool things. As you go through the game you can discover things that make your outcome different. Like you can find the power up for double jump but that means you won’t find another item (a scooter to go faster or something). You can start to fight your fears with your lvls ups. Then you get to adult hood, the bright colors fade. You begin to slowly lose power ups you had from teenage years. Not sure of ending yet.\n\nHere’s a demo I made in one day.

You would start bleeding out and a medical kit would have to be used to stop it, showing an animation of you cutting off circulation to your stumpy arm (And you could collect your hand on the ground.)

ihpeu5,A RPG-card collection game!,A game where you explorer a world and fit off monsters and do raids. During all this you can find cards for the card game aspect of it. When the player goes into the main town or area can queue for a card game with the cards they found explorering the world. Only certain cards can be found in certain areas of the map.
ihp7f5,The 6th Day,"Yes! That’s right, that classic Arnie film but a game.\n\nNow hear me out, of course I don’t mean a game based on the film, I wouldn’t want to play as Adam Gibson or his clone.\n\nBut wouldn’t a game set in that world, or at least based on that concept be pretty tasty? Maybe your a clone gone bad, or a clone who’s realised he’s/she’s a clone and now the secret clone creators are trying to kill you to keep it secret, or maybe you work for the secret clone agency and your job is to hunt down and take out clones gone bad.\n\nAs I wrote this, I’m left wondering, have I just the described the Minority Report game? (Which by the way I’d completely forgotten about until now, what a brilliant game that was) \n\nThoughts?!"

ihgima,Retail game,"It would be similar to Papers Please and Not Tonight. You work at the register in a small quick shop. You have to scan items, check prices, engage with customers, ect. There could be the occasional attempted shoplifter which you would have to look out for (maybe with a scanning thing?), people trying to underpay, entitled people, and more. There could be some rules that get slowly layered on. Maybe there's an unlisted price cut, a sale, a 2 for 1, or a limit on how many of one thing you can buy in an order. Every now and then you might have to get an item from behind the counter or check ID if someones buying alcohol or cigarettes."

ihcxdi,Evolution Battle Royale,"It would work like a mix of Spore and the Hunger Games, where a set number of featureless creatures all spawn into the wilderness at once. The main premise is that over time or perhaps by killing non-player prey will give you DNA to spend on upgrading your creature with limbs, defense mechanisms, and body shapes. You’d probably also start out with a few DNA points, though I’m not sure how you would spend them... maybe through resting? Anyways, the goal is to upgrade your creature enough to the point where you can take on other players, and eventually be the last creature standing. \n\nSome examples of upgrades would be claws, horns, armor plating, scent tracking, venom, muscular arms or legs, quills, grasping hands, thermal vision, echolocation, night vision, and probably more. In general, things that would aid in both survival and combat.\n\nJust an idea that popped into my head."

iha3kd,Avatar of the Cooking God,"This will be a monster hunter type game where the player wanders the wilderness collecting obscure plants and killing giant monsters. Instead of using the remains to craft armor and weapons the player must use the remains to craft dishes for the Gods. The player is given a recipe via divine vision, and their ability to collect and process the ingredients will be judged by a pantheon of fickle Olympian style gods. \n\nThe manner in which you gather the ingredients would matter in this game. It might be easier to kill that giant scorpion with an arrow through they eye, but the recipe said the eye cluster must be preserved and the meat should be tenderized while living, so pack up the bow and pull out the giant maul. Alternatively adrenaline may ruin the meat and the player must take the creature unawares or risk loosing points in the judging.\n\nAlso time limits would play a role where they player mute ensure the freshness of some ingredients by speed running through dangerous parts of the world. Ingredient substitution will be possible, but result in a lower score and reduced praise by the fickle gourmet deities.\n\nOnce the ingredients are procured (or while) if freshness is an issue. The player can place certain ingredients in giant magical contraptions to cook, freeze, blend, or otherwise process the components as the recipe demands. Time can be sped up or skipped if the player accomplishes one stage of the recipe faster \n\nI envision the final dish being some artfully presented monster remains presented on a giant alter that is lifted to the heavens. Soon after there is a conversation between the gods about the dish that echo down to the player. It should sound similar to the judging section of Iron Chef."
ih95v4,2v2 Game About Scaring Away the Enemy by Imitating a CPU Monster,"I just thought of this after playing some Dead by Daylight so it’s not very refined. A 2v2 game that also has a computer player on one side. The setting would be a foggy night in a fenced-in, square park. \n\n\nOne side is the treasure hunters, whose main objective is to collect more than 50% of the coins on the maps. If they manage to do so they win and if they get less than half they lose.\n\n\nThe other side is the rival treasure hunters who work with the computer monster by imitating it to “scare off” the treasure hunters.\n\n\nThe one group would be trying to collect individual coins scattered across a small map. The map would have bushes, rocks, and trees for the treasure hunters to hide behind and for coins to be hidden behind. 50 coins could spawn but each one has only a chance of spawning, so you never know how many are on the map. There’s a reason for this that I’ll get back to later. \n\n\nMatches will be eight minutes long. The computer player monster will spawn in 3 times per game for 1 minute and 15 seconds during which it will move around the map looking for treasure hunters. If it “sees” one by facing directly towards him at a range it will become even faster than the player and chase them until it can no longer see him. If it catches up it will one shot you. It’s very hard to escape the monster once he sees you. It’s random when the monster spawns in so it could possibly despawn then immediately spawn back in (it always spawns away from hunters). \n\n\nThe monster gives off cues to let other players know it’s near since it isn’t huge and doesn’t stand out much. It leaves temporary footprints wherever it goes, makes a loud screeching sound every once in a while, and makes quiet tree branch braking noises often. \n\n\nThe rivals are trying to imitate this monster to keep players from getting gold or even “scare them off”. They don’t make any noises on their own but can use abilities to make sounds, footprints, a fake monster scarecrow, etc. \n\n\nFinally, the treasure hunters have the ability to wait five seconds of being vulnerable and “quit”. Once both hunters quit their gold is counted up to see if it’s more than half of the total coins that were on the map. If it was, they win and if it wasn’t, they lose. If you are killed by the monster your coins don’t matter. \n\n\nThe match ends when the 8 minute timer reaches zero, or if both hunters have either quit or been killed."
ih8dhl,A party game where the player is the mouse cursor,"(sorry for my english)\n\nHere is a little idea I got while playing osu! for a 2d party game on a pc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBasically the whole principle is that players are represented by their mouse cursors.\n\nThe players move around an area with their mouse and face challenges (see the example of mini-games just after)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe limit of this concept is that I do not know if it would be technically possible to make interactions between the players or even to make them evolve on the same ""map"" (Because of the latency of the network with respect to the possible speed of the mouse cursor, this will probably create a significant lack of precision?)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo if this is not possible, the mini-games would therefore only be solo challenges, where, at the end, there would be a comparison (of score or time) between all the players.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExamples of possible mini-games:\n\n* Avoid colliding with moving obstacles and survive as long as possible.\n* A race where you must not touch the edges of a narrow circuit (otherwise you will return to the starting point).\n* Rotate the mouse as fast as possible, every 5s the player with the poorest rpm is eliminated\n* Move to the right areas before the rest of the map eliminates you, survive as long as possible\n* Musical chairs: circles appear and players must place themselves in them. Except that there are \[number of players\] -1 circles. In each ""round"" a player is therefore eliminated.\n* etc...\n\nThese are basic and easy to find mini-game ideas, and I think anyone can imagine improvements or derivatives of these ideas.\n\nBasically the different types of minis-games are:\n\n* Survive as long as possible\n* Have the best score / time\n* A mixture of both (with a principle of round)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end, rather than being random and fun, the game would be rather skilful and ""competitive""\n\nThe game could therefore take place like a ""uther party"" : a series of quick mini-games with a score limit or number of mini-games performed."
ih73vf,Openworld Post apocalyptic game., \n\nSo i have always been a big fan of open world franchises like fallout gta the forest etc. But they all seem to run out because open world games always have a lot to explore but once the story mode/campaign has finished it has already brought you throughout the map so you know everything already there. Fallout 4 was actually still quite interesting after the story mode as of the dlc's and creation club features and even mods expanded the experience making the game still relevant . So what about a Post apocalyptic Open world game that had 5 zones / Worlds 1 being a forest 2 a town (this would be where most npc's (survivors) would be) 3 a desert 4 a radioactive area that would be where the infection started and 5 an airport .\n\nSo that would be the world but i also want to Incorporate Bethesda's mods or creation club idea to expand the game via the community.\n\nThe story would start off as you being a character of your choice works with the air force you are on your daily flight routine when you spot a red spot in the sky you call command to inform them about it then all power goes out as if an emp has set off you panic and eject as your jet is falling and this would trigger a cut scene of a green meteorite hitting the ground at the airport and temporarily deafening you that is the introduction to the game.\n\nThe meteorite would trigger humans and animals to either die or become incredibly strong (a bit like a zombie) ones who lived reeked havoc upon the city and you being in the air at the time makes you one of the survivors however the land is extremely radioactive near the meteorite and you need to find shelter so you head to the town You have a glock 18 in your holster to defend yourself.\n\nYour first encounter is at a house its a man who is willing to trade your gun for a loaf of bread and a bottle of water should you accept the trade you will have to run but if you dont you can defend yourself but will be hungry making you slower or you could think outside the box and shoot him and take the stuff this would decrease your representation though and have a chance of attracting the infected (your representation would affect what items traders are willing to trade with you)\n\nThis is as far as i have come with this story so far but might post a second part if i can think of more. thank you for reading and hope you liked the idea as much as i did if so feel free to up vote if not leave a down vote to show me how this idea seemed to you Thanks and have a great day.

igtjf3,"A game I’ve been craving: a crafting, shopkeep game for clothes","Warning! This is a long post. I’m gonna try to go in depth because I really want this kind of game to exist, but I don’t have the game dev skills. \n\nThink the basic groundwork of Stardew Valley (another game I love), make the graphics a little more realistic, and make it into a fashion designing/ tailor shopkeeping game. You go out and collect materials. You craft with those materials. You sell the products. \n\nI will break down different parts of gameplay that I think would keep this type of game interesting.\n\n1) material gathering. There are some materials that are easier to get (ie. cotton) and some that are harder to get (ie. silk). You might buy the materials, or you could go out and gather them. Maybe build relationships with NPCs who own farms and shops to earn discounts or gain access to higher quality materials more easily. (So maybe there’s a farm for cotton, etc. And a shop for dyes and flowers). Maybe have some rare seasonal materials, and your NPC relationships might help to attain these materials even when not in season. So there is a hierarchy of materials based on supply and demand.\n\n2) Crafting. You use the raw materials and refine them into fabrics. The hierarchy of materials will create a similar hierarchy of fabrics. The better the fabrics, the more expensive your clothing can sell for. The crafting part of the game is also where you design clothes. Maybe choose different necklines, sleeve types, etc. Or maybe have a mesh over a mannequin with dots that you can pull and shape the fabric into the clothing you desire. In the crafting area you can put a lot of the feeling of progression. Like unlocking fabric and clothing recipes. So you start off crafting cotton but then learn to craft silk. Maybe you need to upgrade your workspace with equipment to be able to use silk and other rare materials. Doesn’t need to be limited to just clothing, we can also design shoes (which needs leather and rubber), and accessories (like hats, jewellery) and yes we would need to get the materials for all these again. Jewellery could be a really premium item. If you find a sweet, sweet diamond, put it in a necklace and make a fortune.\n\nDye the fabric (which can be another material you need to gather. Craft dyes based on the color of flowers you find, etc. Or you can just buy the dyes from an NPC if you have the money). Add patterns to the fabric (and unlock recipe patterns as you progress through the game). Maybe add words.\n\nMaybe have a crafting mini game for the “sewing”. It doesn’t even need to look like sewing necessarily. The purpose of the mini game is to A) add another gameplay element to change up the pace and keep things interesting, and B) provide a bonus to the quality of your clothing by doing well at the mini game (and therefore sell it at a higher price). The mini game could be skipped if the player doesn’t feel like it, but they would also miss out on that little bonus.\n\n3) Shopkeeping and selling. You have a storefront that you can upgrade as you progress. Interior design options that help invite customers in, increase space, mannequins in the window (what is displayed can help invite customers in. Better quality clothing, more customers). You can set the price of your clothes or use a suggested price. You develop a reputation as you sell. Some customers might start commissioning clothing from you; a specific design with a certain pattern, color, and fabric. If you can fulfill their order correctly, they pay you a tip on top of the cost of the clothing. More money! But if you don’t fulfill the commission correctly or on time, then you may not get paid and/or lose reputation. Commissions should be challenging and would be something that the player can choose to take. This way every player can sort of influence the difficulty of the game. More commissions = more difficult.\n\n4) Upgrading. Earn skill points to increase the quality of specific fabrics or designs. Or skill points to decrease material costs. Invest your money in better equipment that needs, for example, only 2 raw cotton per unit of fabric instead of 4. Improve the town so that the shops can have better supplies available. Instead of selling a shirt, gift it to that one shop owner so now they give you a discount. But relationships dwindle if you ignore them for a while so you’ll have to do a bit of maintenance if you want that maximum discount.\n\n5) So you’ve got a thriving business. What now? Why make money? Have a rent or overhead cost that needs to be paid. So you better be able to sell something to stay in business. Add in special events (a wedding bride and groom with outrageous demands but the reward is handsome). Have a thief break in and steal money and/or materials (god forbid they steal the materials for a commission that’s due tomorrow!). Have a shortage of a certain material or a sudden spike in demand that forces the player to adapt and perhaps change their business plan (maybe there was a tragic war and everyone suddenly needs black dyed formal clothing, and demand for bright colourful clothes plummet). Maybe there’s a cosplay convention soon and you get a bunch of demand/commissions for wings and Lolita style dresses. Also, maybe have a player avatar that you can dress up in clothes you’ve created. A walking model that potential customers may see while you get to look fabulous walking around downtown.\n\nThe possibilities are endless. There are always more recipes to unlock. More items to design. Don’t get complacent because something is going to throw a wrench in your current set up (the depression anyone?). And the player has to survive through it all."

There are two players, one is blind and the other is deaf and they have to communicate and rely on each other to survive a world of obstacles. There's no voice chat for obvious reasons so you have to figure out how to communicate with each other so you can navigate through the world."

Maybe put a puzzle game.  \nA sanguine girl with a lot of energy ? A fighting game, race game, or things like that would fit her really nicely !  \n\n\nSo, yeah. Here's that. I'm too beginner to do that, so I lend the project to anyone that would love to do it and think the idea is fun. Feel free to do anything with it, and to tell me if you love the idea and might try to do something with it !

I would love to see a contemporary war FPS game that was heavily story driven and had a lengthy campaign that competed with the play lengths of an rpg."
igedcr,Looking for creature trapping ideas,"Hello, \n\nI'm working on prototyping a game that is inspired by Viva Pinata, and Slime Rancher (if that helps anyone) where you have a mid sized piece of land that you can plant things on, and have creatures on. The creatures on your land eat plants, and 'output' products that you can then sell.\n\nIt's first person, fantasy themed, stylized art style, with the tone being some where between Spyro, and Sea of Thieves (a little silly, and cartoony, but not too much so, but not overly serious, or realistic). The plan is to have about 10-15 creatures, their size ranging from chicken, to rhino (at least that is the plan as it stands, opening to changing it though). I'm fine if creatures can hurt/kill the player, however the player is not able to hurt/kill creatures.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow with the context out of the way, the problem is this. The way I want the player to get creatures, is by leaving their piece of land, and going out in to the wild to find the creatures and bring them back to their land (once the creature is on the player's land the player needs to have certain plants on their land in order for the creature to stay).\n\nSo how does one go about getting the creature back to their land?\n\nI think some form of trapping/capturing is most likely the way to go, as it has the most potential for engaging gameplay I think and the strongest player fantasy. I have been unable to think of engaging gameplay for it though.\n\nOther ideas I had were:\n\n* Stealing an egg from a creatures nest. (Unsure how to make this engaging or interesting multiple times. Fun maybe 2 or 3 times)\n* Placing down a trap that triggers when a creature walks over it. (Never really seen this fun in any game it has been it)\n* Throwing a net of the creature. (Kind of the same as the trap, not that engaging)\n* Leading them back. (Walking with a slower thing following you is rather annoying)\n\nI am open to most any ideas, even if it requires a bit of a change to the current plans (doesn't have to be trapping, though I think that has the most potential). I would really appreciate any ideas!"
ig5edw,Armageddon,"     I have an idea for a new game.  It would be called “The Armageddon”, and it would be the final battle between good and evil. Apocalyptic games tend to be about zombies, but few end-of-the-world games focus on this theme.\n\n     Essentially, this game would be a city-vs-city game, where you would win the game by defeating the opposing city.  Storywise, the game might last 50 years, but to make a lengthier game, I’d recommend that two in-game years last about one real hour.  The player would choose a side in the beginning of the game, and I’d recommend having lots of good characters and lots of evil characters to choose from.  Since people from all over the world and all walks of life would be on both sides, I’d recommend a diverse choice of characters (all races, both genders, a variety of nationalities, etc.).  I’d also recommend that the characters be relatively young, since the game would last decades.\n\n     After you pick your side and your character, you would start off by being contacted by either God or the Devil, and you would be told that your mission is to lead your side to victory over the other in the Armageddon.  You would be told that a genetically-engineered virus will get out of containment, and that most of the people on Earth will soon be dead. Worldwide, maybe only a few million would live.  You would be given a timeline of when the virus will hit (maybe in a month), where in the world your city will be built, and given time to prepare.  This time would be crucial, because vital tasks could be completed before the virus spreads, chaos and death ensue, and civilizations collapse and go dark.  It would naturally be important to arrive at the location of your city before transportation is crippled.\n\n     The winners of the Armageddon would get to repopulate the Earth.  God would want those people to be good, since that would start things off on the right foot, and the Devil would want the bad and evil ones to succeed, hoping for an era of evil.  All of the people that will survive the virus will instinctively know where both sides will reside, and will know which side they belong on.  Earlier on in the game, both cities will compete for all of those “in-between” people that are more in the neutral range.  Over time, more people would arrive at both cities.  I’d recommend both the good and evil cities be on the same landmass, since crossing oceans would be difficult.  They should be spaced at least a few thousand miles apart.  If neither side wins after 50 years, then it would be a stalemate, and both sides would repopulate the Earth, which would mean that the world would be a blend of good and evil like it is now.\n\n     This game should have a “real feel” to it.  Avoid magic and mythical beasts.  There shouldn’t even be angels and demons in the game. It should be ordinary people choosing sides and fighting this war. Throughout the game, players would need to gather resources, build their city, raise armies, and ultimately bring their forces to bear against the enemy.\n\n     As for character selection, different characters would have different strengths and different weaknesses. A more charismatic leader would bring in more of the in-between people, whereas a more radically good or radically evil leader would consolidate their base supporters but may be less appealing to the average Joe.  Some leaders might have better technical skills, some might be more persuasive or intimidating, and others may have industrial or scientific skill, or even military training.  A description of each character should be given at the start of the game, as well as their life history. I’d recommend that their stories be believably good and believably evil (it would be unrealistic to have an evil character that drinks baby blood and does demonic rituals, since this is seldomly how evil manifests itself in the real world).\n\n     As for difficulty levels, there should be easy, normal, hard, and apocalyptic.  For the easy difficulty, the game would be tilted in your favor, and you might even be able to choose the enemy leader.  For normal, the game would be weighted equally for both cities, and the enemy leader would be randomly chosen by the computer.  For hard, things would be tiled against you.  As for the ‘apocalyptic’ difficulty, the game should be extraordinarily hard, with the odds strongly against you, and the computer might choose an enemy leader that has skills which would counter your strengths.\n\n     Throughout the game, the player may have to make choices that will affect how the game plays out. Good leaders may try to rule more fairly than evil ones.  Challenges to the player’s authority and power may also arise from within their city, so one way to lose the game is if another leader emerges from the masses and takes your place. This dethroning would be different depending on the side that you’re on. In the good city, another leader may present stronger arguments in a debate, questioning your commitment to good values and principles, which would lead to people choosing him/her over you.  In the evil city, it could be an armed insurrection that you would need to beat down.  Keeping your people happy would minimize challenges to your authority.\n\n     I hope that you like my idea.  It seems like this has the potential to be a good game.  People must be getting tired of Zombie Apocalypse games by now. ;)"
ig4u1q,ZPG City builder,"I really don't know if something like this exist, but my Idea is a game like Cities Skylines or Foundation, but instead of doing anything, it's a *Zero Player Game*, or, explaining, you don't have any control, it starts with only one farm, then, someone builds a shop to sell the crops, then the shop guy builds his house, then another farmer appears, and the cycle goes on, slowly evolving from a small rural village into a gigantic metropolis, maybe the player can even zoom on a specific citizen and follow him around, with the game simulating Family trees, markets, jobs, houses, etc.\nThe player could even have a little bit of control, by creating a ""Good or Bad season""or something like that once in a while. i'm posting this here because I have literally 0 experience with coding but had this idea."

ifwrcl,Spell creation where your imagination is the limit,"I’ve been thinking about this for a couple weeks now and have some ideas fleshed out but I’m really just looking for some people to bounce ideas off of.\n\nI’m thinking this game would be a puzzle solving 3D platformer in the end, similar to a Legend of Zelda dungeon, where the puzzles will be solved by creating different spells. Sort of taking Breath of the Wilds world exploration approach to puzzle solving, where there are multiple ways to come at a problem. But as I stated before I’d like to build the spell creation system and fully flesh that out before getting to actual game design. \n\n\nI’m trying my best to keep it from getting too broad of a concept too soon, so right now I’m not thinking about gameplay or story or art style. I’m just trying to focus on this spell creation system, and then maybe from there I’ll (we’ll?) build something from that.  \n\nI’ve seen OrbusVr and their mage class talked about here and I think that’s a really cool idea but you’re still subject to the limitations set by the developers in the way that there are pre-made spells that the players learn. \nI guess my idea would be more closely related to the spell creation system in Oblivion, just expanded to serve whatever needs the player has. \nThe player would basically first choose a type of magic (elemental magic, some sort of enchanting magic, etc), next the player would go through a series of UI that helps them add attributes to their spell. A Range section that would help them choose how the spell is cast (on the player themself, on something they touch, or a long range spell for instance), next  would be Magnitude, Duration, Area (for a spell that casts an area of effect), and I’ve also thought about certain properties that may assist the player in puzzle solving like Additive/subtractive properties.\n\nIf I had to give an example that might help explain this system I have so far, here is how one could recreate Mei’s wall of ice move from Overwatch(except here it will be a wall of earth, as I’ve not yet figured a good way of casting ice magic):\n-Set the element to earth\n-set range to long range\n-set area of effect to be a rectangle (UI would help to create the desired shape)\n-include additive property that will take whatever the player is aiming at and create more of that target object, this target being the ground. \n-duration could be for as long as the player is casting the spell (or however long they hold the “cast spell” button)\n\n\nMy main concern right now is fleshing out this system so that it can truly only be limited by ones imagination. Think of using that wall of earth on a cliff side, using it to create a bridge between two cliffs. Or if the player is more proficient in water magic instead of earth magic they could attempt the same thing, but by using some attribute I haven’t thought of yet, maybe turn the water wall created by their spell into an ice spell that lets them walk across that way. \n\nI’d love to hear some thoughts on what sorts of attributes a player should be able to add to their spell, and the different ways those attributes will affect it, or sub-attributes (like how Range has self, touch, or long range), or what sorts of spells you’d like to be able to cast. My thinking is that if I can think of enough hypothetical situations, like the two cliffs idea, I’ll be able to better flesh out this system."

ifvu32,City States (Grand Strategy),"City States\n\nReal time 4X game taking place in the bronze age.\n\nCore ideas: Trade, Geography and Demographics shape the development of society and we want players to be able to experience the rise and fall of civilizations during the bronze age. trade and resources are the two most important things. Copper, tin, and food are very valuable and will drive trade diplomacy and conflict. Empires will not survive for long without fertile land or access to bronze. These desires will drive conflict in the game. \n\nIE  if my neighbor embargos tin it means I have to either start to languish economically and militarily, fight him, pay him off or find a new source of tin.\n\nAlso should be designed to be playable in multiplayer\n\nMap\n\nThe map will be made up of hexes and each hex will have a good they produce, terrain, fertility, ideal population, population, demographics (including culture and religion), happiness, militia and be urban or rural. One thing to note is that characters will own many tiles but can only directly control one urban tile which will be your capital. Thus we will make sudo provinces out of what rural land belongs to what urban city.\n\nEconomy;\n\nWill have goods that can be purchased from any city and the price in that city is determined by the price from a producer multiplied by the distance squared over 100 plus 1 with half going to urban and half going to rural. In addition to this transport cost most cities will charge a tarrif of around 3% but can go as high as 10% in times of war.\n\nPrice from Producer is determined by base good cost 1 for basic 10 for advanced multiplied by demand over production.\n\nNote the price for goods in villages is determined by their attached city; they can only buy and sell from the attached city. While urban tiles can buy and sell from other urban tiles\n\nWhat all this means is you want your empire to be self sufficient and control trade routes for valuable commodities to reap free money but to high of tariffs will upset neighbors.\n\nAt the moment each rural tile will be able to advance to a city when certain size conditions are met and each urban tile can devolve to rural if razed to much the arbitrary threshold will be around 10000\n\nEzkiel 6:12 motto\n\nGoods:\n\nBasic goods: produced ruraly\n\nFood 0           /\n\nCopper 1\n\nTin 2\n\nWood 3           \n\nStone 4            increases ideal pop /\n\nClay 5         \n\nWool 6\n\n\*Gold\n\n\*Silver \n\nAdvanced goods: produced city\n\nArmor - requires bronze 7                 needed for warriors /\n\nWeapons  - requires bronze wood 8       needed for warriors /\n\nPottery - requires clay 9                            increases efficiency  /\n\nTools - require bronze wood 10                             increases efficiency  /\n\nclothes- requires wool 11                            increases efficiency /\n\nBronze - copper tin 12                             \n\nBuilding - requires stone and wood\n\nEach urban tile will have about 20 rural tiles connected \n\nRural tile must belong to a city\n\nCities are ruled by greater nobles while rural tiles. are ruled by lesser nobles (lesser novels right now have no planned gameplay impact)\n\nBut by far the most common resource is but fertility varies wildly \n\nEach village and city all have their own economic pool  as well as the village or city rulers. Either party can and will upgrade their industries, tools military/militia and pop capacity\n\nAll have their own wealth pool and priorities\n\nUrban increases urbanPopCap and buys food clothes pottery tools and basic goods based of urban industry\n\nNobel increase some industry but mainly invest in military\n\nRural increases ruralPopCap and buys food clothes pottery tools\n\nRural tiles can evolve into a urban ones when certain conditions are met\n\nStarting cities 10,000 urban\n\nWhile several hundred for rural\n\nDiplomacy (needs work)\n\nThere will be thresholds for friend neutral and enemy and will be randomized at the start of the game if someone attacks your friend they lose reputation with you and if someone attacks your enemy they gain rep with you.\n\nIn addition to this randomized start trade religion culture and how you treat people not of your culture or religion will affect neighbors opinions.\n\nInternal Diplomacy\n\nRealm structure\n\nFaction Controller - who controls the realm\n\nDukes - rules a city and the nobles under them\n\nCities - each controlled by a single greater Nobel\n\nRural provinces - each controlled by a lesser Nobel if the province is unloyal then the nobel will rebel but if it is not they won't they are basically just a representation of the tile\n\nNobels inside your territory will have armies you can call on in times of war but be careful as they can also turn on you in an instant also the faction controller can only                                                                                                                                      \n\n(Lesser nobles will have poorly trained militia while greater nobles those who control cities might have standing bronze and chariot equipped armies.)\n\nBase Nobel Ideology\n\nDefender - Focus on Wall and Military non aggressive\n\nWarlord - Focus on military seeks to take relentlessly aggressive\n\nBuilder - Builds defenses and Economy\n\nBureaucrat - Builds economy wont rebel\n\nAmbitious - Seeks to rule but tempers aggression\n\nEvery AI created will have one of these traits whether a faction, city, or village ruler\n\nInternal structure of a realm\n\nFaction - only one ruler per realm\n\nCity - only one city per character though if you are ruler they will swear fealty\n\nVillage - honestly don't know lesser nobles might control a bunch but not sure of implementation\n\nAt game start each rural tile will pledge to a City each city will be controlled by a faction and each Faction will be controlled by a nobel house\n\nI think each Faction will start with one city \n\nEach group will have happiness and loyalty. Loyalty changes slowly but if someone becomes disloyal they will look to rebel. Happiness jumps around and having positive happiness will increase loyalty while negative decreases it.\n\nRebellion\n\nDisloyal groups if not too dissimilar will coordinate together to look for opportunities to rebel. Ideally we want about 30% of rebellions to be successful so take that into account when calculating when to rebel.\n\nCity Management\n\nSince each person only directly controls one city or urban tile it makes sense to invest in your capital to that end you can control tax rate control tariffs and invest in industries walls housing guards and all sorts of other things.\n\nWarfare\n\narmies will physically move around the map together warfare will generally happen around 5 months of the year as if you draft the militia during planting season prepare to starve that said if you can afford a standing army you will have a huge advantage. You can raze countryside as you go along and the enemy might come out to fight but most warfare revolves around raiding then sieging for several months taking a City then going home. This however impacts them greatly economically and if you are sufficiently strong enough to storm walls you will be able to take many cities. \n\nReligion (idk)\n\nEffects opinion if rich your religion will spread through trade. Also military or economic success spreads your religion as God must be on your side. Additionally as you have successes you gain right to rule where people of your religion gain happiness as you lose you lose right to rule where people of your religion lose happiness\n\nCulture (idk)\n\nVery much tied to religion in the Bronze Age though harder to spread mostly only people born in your faction will be your culture.\n\nTechnology (idk)\n\nMost technology will result in incremental improvements in efficiency in production, movement or other such things \n\nSocietal inventions (needs more work)\n\nThese are things that will allow you to spread your religion and culture easier, also increase loyalty growth and make your vassals more loyal. Additionally can unlock new forms of government.\n\nGovernment (ehhhhh)\n\nThere should be ways to control how your country is governed but it should be researched the same way technology and society is \n\nRight To Rule\n\nThis is similar to China's mandate of heaven. It is basically your people's religion, culture and nobles faith in your ability and blessing by God. One good example of this in history is the Assyrians who’s religion promised them eternal victory after around 200 years of rule they started to taste defeat and fell apart to civil war and economic decline. People lost faith in the monarch and through that the government so they lost loyalty. This is something we want to emulate  small regimes snowballing victories into victory if people truly believe god is on their side why revolt they’ll just lose. Similarly with large empires as they suffer under their own bureaucratic bloat once people know defeat it snowballs\n\nCorruption \n\nCorruption is basically a metric to indicate how complacent a country is. Corruption increases costs and decreases loyalty and is a metric of the realm it grows  while there is no conflict or rival. A great example of such a thing is China which went through iterations of rebirth defeating whatever there issue was whether famine or invaders then when they had nothing to contest them the country grows lazy fat and corrupt until the next issue arrises. The effect of this in gameplay would be prevent one big power from dominating a region indefinitely.\n\nMovement\n\nEach tick or advancement of the game represents a day and in general it will take one day to move one tile however terrain like mountains take longer tiles like mountains will take longer"

ifs9fq,Game idea!,"Ok so this is probably heavily based off moonlighter cuz I started playing it and I'm really enjoying it but here it goes:\n\nThis is an RPG pixel style game (moonlighter style)\nSo there's a town that really lacks natural resources and specifically food resources\nSo the soil is bad, river is far away and doesn't have much fish.. etc \n\nThere's very limited stuff that the townsfolk can eat so their food is basically boring.\n\nHOWEVER\nThere is a way to get good food ingredients and stuff and the only way is from specific dangerous dungeons, \nAnd luckily the MC (you) has a family bakery/restaurant that your family has been running for a while and it's MCs turn to take over and get ingredients from the dungeon while also coming up with new recipes for the bakery \nSo there's gonna be a mechanic where you can add ingredients to cook (I can imagine like stirring ingredients and stuff like that when you're making the recipe) and if it's a success you unlock a new recipe for the bakery \nYou can only make it again if you have the ingredients though \n\nThe character design will either be customizable (unlocking new clothes and stuff with time) OR play as different members of the family (but that is also unlocked with time as you progress) \n\nThere's another way to get good ingredients and that's when foreigners(merchants) from other countries come to sell their ingredients, it's pricier but they are good quality rare items \n\n\nAnyways that's all I've come up with but I got excited just thinking of something like that 😂😂 hope y'all agree"

ifa7zo,Radio Commander meets cards for WW2 Battle of the Atlantic,"Just though of an idea.  I really like the cards in Shadow Empire and Barbarossa.  I also like the fog of war of Radio Commander.\n\nYou play the leader of either the WW2 Kriegsmarine or British Admiralty looking at a top down view of the Atlantic.  Your ships, aircraft and merchant ships move in real time but plots are only updated as messages come into HQ.  You send out orders.\n\nYou have resource points to play cards.  There is a seaprate random deck for each player who starts with 3 cards.  Or maybe we use the choice mechanic in Barbarossa.  You can play a card if you have sufficient resource points.  You have no idea what the enemy has played unless you play a spy card of some kind which may reveal opponent's tech.\n\nOrders are done as the are in Radio Commander.  Basically the kinds of messages to and fro from the respective nacal HQs.  German win if the sink 300 tonnes of merchant shipling per month for 3 consecutive months.  Allies win if they don't by 5/8/45. The game starts 9/3/39, but may have shorter mid and late campaigns.\n\nIt's should be 1 or 2 player with a 1x to 64x time compression.\n\nIf anyone likes this idea please comment.  BTW Battle of Britain (air war) would be interesting this way too.  I can write a design doc on google docs if you like."

if8f2c,A Bar managing mobile game,"How about mobile game where you can create your own bar and grille? How the game would start off is literally a blank lounge with nothing but a floor and walls. Everything in game is customizable, including being able to choose where an item or table goes and where it faces. Starting out you’d decide the color of the floor and walls, maybe even the theme of your bar too! You can choose from sports bar, gaming lounge, pool hall, gambling lounge, retro 80’s bar, ect. Depending on which one you choose also depends on which type &amp; style of unique interior designs and furniture you unlock as you level up and progress through the game. (Example: Sports bar: Jerseys, team theme, TV’s. Retro: Neon lighting, old school radio, checker flooring.) also make it to where you can visit and check out people’s in your contacts bar, help them serve customers, and even gift an item. Depending on your level, reputation &amp; rarity of items in bar will determine the amount of customers you can get and will get in a session, how many bartenders you can have and also how big your bar can grow too as well. Maybe an upgrade for people who can’t be on there phone a lot can use there saved coins to upgrade a bartender to a manager who helps collect coins while your away from your phone. (To start off you’d independently click on a person to collect there money) also you can have maybe monthly events where you have to complete specific task in a certain amount of time and will be ranking against other players around the world. Top 50-100 players get “celebrity guest”. You can choose for them to appear when you’d like one time and they boost your rep, how many customers come into your bar, and each customer pays double for the amount of time that person is in your bar. (It can be an effect that last 5-10 mins) you could maybe even save them up and win multiple and stack them to make the effect longer. Obviously this game isn’t a finished idea... but it be cool for it to go into effect. I’ve always wanted a game like this personally but never had the skills or resources to make it happen myself."

All you have starting out is a small journal that you can write in, and you just make entries writing about the local wildlife. I don't know if it would be really open and you just write randomly with no guidelines and hope it's correct, or if you write things in specific boxes such as ""The creature eats \_\_\_ and sleeps during \_\_\_"" and you just fill those. I just feel like it would be cool to see a new creature and follow it for a while to study its behavior and write down your findings. maybe there's a nearby village that you can sell the entries to, and the more correct and detailed they are, the more you get paid to buy more equipment to study more creatures. maybe late game you can even go to other planets when you document everything in the starting area. All I know is that it should be open world, and you have to document wildlife yourself. Other than that, go nuts reddit. I know you'll do me proud."

Bosses drop materials for crafting and you can craft potions, armor, weapons, and accessories to increase your stats. I'm planning for there to be four classes: Apprentice, Archer, Warrior, and Wizard. Apprentice is for beginners and includes an attack for every class, the other classes are unlocked by achievements along with treasure gained from bosses.\n\nDo you think a permadeath-roguelike style like Binding of Isaac or a checkpoint based platformer like shovel knight would suit this game better?"
gtkqre,Scuba diving game idea.,"Hey All. \n\nBit nervous posting as it’s my first post but the other day I had a dream about making or playing a scuba diving game bit like the sims but there was different pools with people in like a training centre.\n\nIt was 3rd person and you could control your character. The map was open world and you could explore, once you’ve finished your training you can explore the seas etc. \n\nSorry about my grammar I’m autistic. What do you all think of the idea?. If people make the game could I be credited please?. Or have a character based of me 🙂. \n\nCheers\nBrutal."
gtimp3,A horror game set in the old west where you play as a woman accused of being a witch,"The game would start out with you escaping your holding cell. You'd proceed into the Rocky Mountains while being tracked by men with bolt/lever action rifles. As night falls during your escape, weird and spooky things could be in the forest that slowly reveal that you are indeed a witch which is something the player character did not know and/or refuses to believe."
gthheq,A horror survival game about a four legged beast that stalks and eventually kills you.,"(I’m really sorry this is so long. There is no TL:Dr) \n\nThe game is 3D, and the style of the game looks pretty much like RDR2. \n\nSo basically you’re a man who got stranded in a forest. However the forest is cursed, so you can walk as far as you want but you’ll never leave the forest. You’re trapped forever and you must survive off of whatever you can find and kill. You’re also able to build shelter. That’s the boring and bland part, the real fun of the game is the beast that stalks you the whole time. \n\nAt the beginning of the game, the beast has no idea where you are. It’ll begin to track you at a random time. When it begins to track you, you’ll get a notification that says “I can smell you”. That notification will be visible on screen at the top left corner and won’t go away once it appears. It’s to tell you that you oughta keep moving if you don’t want the beast getting too close. Your character will need to eat and rest throughout the game. You are allowed to build whatever shelter you want, but what matters is how long you stay put. Sleeping in a bed inside a shelter will fill up your rest meter more than sleeping in a bed that’s out in the open. And it’s less dangerous\n\nIf you’re sloppy, eventually you’ll get a notification that says “I can see you”. The beast can see you from very far away; however it is possible for the beast to lose sight of you if you play your cards right, however it is very difficult. When the beast can see you, it’ll approach you much faster and follow with better accuracy. It is very very difficult for the beast to lose sight of you in the game because it’s *designed* to stalk you. The beast is extremely quiet but the game has no music so if you hold still you can hear it move through certain things like bushes or water. \n\nThe rules are to survive as long as possible, but the game isn’t really designed to take less than 20 minutes. You can harvest fruits and kill other animals to eat. You can make materials out of various things you find in the forest, but your tools/weapons will break overtime. \n\nIf you’ve read this far you’re probably wondering what happens when the beasts gets very close or whether not you’re able to kill/attack it. No you cannot kill the beast and a situation in which you can see the beast briefly enough to attack, you’re probably about to die. Being able to hear the beast move is a sign that you need to get moving or accept fate. The beast will only attack when it can guarantee success, **and there will not be a warning when it’s ready to attack**. For extra spook, the beast is an active AI, so depending on where you are, you *can* see it aside from when it attacks...in certain circumstances. \n\nThere are only three real counters to the beast. Frequent movement keeps it from coming closer, the beast loses sight of you easier in the day because it’s harder for it to follow you without being detected, and it can’t enter your shelter if you close off the door. If you stay in your shelter for too long, the beast will wait around the exit and kill you when you come out. If you make a lot of exits, it’ll wait near the one you use the most.  if you have an exit that’s on the roof, be aware that the beast can use ladders too. If you leave an entrance open, the beast will ambush you in your home or kill you in your sleep. Both you and the beast can climb trees.\n\nOvertime the beast learns about the player, so doing the same thing over and over could get you ambushed. An example being that if you only move north whenever you abandon one of your shelters, the beast will wait for you to come north and ambush you. The only way to survive an attack from the beast is **dumb luck**. Again, it strikes without warning. It’ll attack in only three ways. It’ll ambush you from a bush, it’ll pounce you from a tree, or it’ll rush you from behind (only if you’re holding still). When I say “dumb luck”, what I mean is you can dodge the beast when it attacks because the attack has a hitbox, but you’ll never see it coming. If you someone manage to dodge its attack, it’ll run away and continue to stalk you. It’ll attack you in broad daylight as well if you aren’t cautious. Attacks from other animals will do damage but an attack from the beast is an instant kill. Increasing the difficulty level makes you run out of energy faster and it makes the beast faster. The longer the beast stalks you, the faster it’ll track you\n\nThat’s basically my whole idea of this game. I’m open to questions and constructive criticism. Go easy on me because I’m new to this whole “sharing my ideas” thing 😅"
gth8aq,the backrooms inspo,"please read the backrooms creepy pasta so you get an idea of what it looks like more. \n\ni know there are already games of this creepy pasta but i thought of my own version. \n\nthere is a timer at the top that is counting down that never ends, this is to give the player anxiety that something is coming when nothing is. after a certain amount of time(which is random) you will hear footsteps, sometimes there are running and getting louder and other times they are faint. there is no other living thing in the game, its just the player. no jump scares of anything, because i feel as if games that give me hella anxiety are way more scary then jump scare games, cause after 2 secs its over. \n\nthis game is a maze and when you get to the exit, its another maze but ill make it more anxiety ridden.\n\nnext level, long hallways with lights that are out or flickering. ill make things move, like the sound of a door opening then closing, or something knocking over, and again, there is nothing there. this one actually has a door exist instead of a different looking wall(which you walk through to get to this level) \n\nthis level is just a long hallway, you cant see to the end after a while of walking. and in this level, there are screams, by animals though, some of the screams are in pain and some are to intimidate other animals. after a while, you'll see a door. but the door is locked with keys. after you look away and back at the door 3 times you hear something fall next to you and the keys are on the floor and the door is open. thats it. this is the firsts time you hear music in the game. at the end. then the starting screen with has gibberish on it. \n\ni think anxiety games are like mind torture, and this is that game, no jump scares just your mind fucking with you."
gtgyla,Futuristic FPS MOBA,"I like the idea of a first person MOBA. It’d have a lot of the same traits as LOL. Like the three lanes, towers, and the troops deploying in each of their lanes. You’d have to go back to base for Med Packs or to purchase upgrades. Instead of teleporting you’d be picked up by some kind of aerial vehicle, which could be destroyed. I imagine it taking place somewhat in the future. Winning is achieved by destroying the enemies core. It could be a reactor, larger tower, etc. \n\nIf possible it’d be cool to have the towers be destroyed either by destruction in a battlefield like manner or internally by planting an explosive which could be defused. They’d have turrets that only your Troops can mount. The Troops could be sniped or gunned out of them. As more Troops spawn they’d fill up the empty turret slots. \n\nAnother game mechanic I think would be cool is to allow for the aerial vehicle to act as medical aid for downed teammates. There shouldn’t be reviving, however, if you die and your teammates manage to get your body back to base (through recall) then it would void the spawn time. Just a thought.  \n\nLet me know what you guys think! I think it’d be a super fun game, would love to hear input or more ideas. If someone makes this game I’d love to be somewhere on the credits."
gteksb,Need a game idea for a cool simple 2d game with a cool mechanic would prefer if it was horror. (Using UE4),
gtehmv,Change bodies,"I've been trying to prototype a FPS game that has fearly simple mechanics just like Superhot (no ammo reloading, no health system) and the main feature would be the ability to change bodies with the enemies. To use that you just need to press a button that slows time (bullet time), so you could select the target easily. After the changing is done (with some nice camera effect), you now has the enemy's gun. That's some situations that I've come up with where that mechanic could be interesting:\n- Jump from a building and, just before the fall, change bodies with a enemy\n- Put a grenade close to you and change bodies just before the explosion\n- Change bodies with some guard and remain quiet acting like him, so nobody would notice\n- Face a enemy with a machine gun in an helicopter, that would be impossible to destroy with normal weapons. So you just change bodies with the enemy and takes control of the gun"

gt94lb,"I'm currently thinking about making a space themed rpg game. What are some cool plot ideas, game location ideas, and race ideas?","The game will be fairly similar to No Man's Sky hopefully. I want there to be an in game economy and multiple civilizations across 6 different playable star systems. Different wares and materials will come from different areas of the universe. There will be a crazy amount of carrier, warship, science vessel, orbital station, starship, rover, and submersible craft variants and upgrades. Will be mainly land focused unlike NMS though. I really want this to be immersive and i want planetary exploration to be one of the more important roles in game. \n\nI really want the game to start with you being sent forward in time but accidentally to the wrong star system. I think that would make a good story or part of it - player wakes on an unknown planet with pip boy like device and finds a way to get off the planet and search for earth. \n\nAnyone have any ideas for a plot or side quest? Any ideas for free roam activities or abilities? I still need engine and weapon ideas for the starcraft. Any ideas for a civilization and its lore?"
gt8xvy,A top-down runner game where you play as a single pixel that grows by collecting other pixels,"Pixels are spread all over the track, and each one you collect makes you one pixel larger (similar to the ball in Katamari Damacy). Becoming larger means you can plow through smaller obstacles, while if you hit an obstacle larger than you, pixels will fly off. Checkpoint flags require that you have a certain amount of pixels accumulated to progress. At the end of each track there is some kind of object that you have to ram your square into, and the more damage you do to it, the more bonus points you get."
gt6qof,Triple mode,"Three playable characters with different gameplay.       \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor example(and how I'm making it), #1 being like Doom 2016, #2 being like Gears of War, and #3 being like Bioshock."
gt5lyg,Game Idea: MOBA Fighting Game,"I like Street Fighter and I like League Of Legends, But what would happen if you combined them. \n\nSo you have 24 fighters in one giant stadium. The player has to be the last man standing. How gameplay works is that the player can only be attacking one player, other players won’t be effected. However, the non effected player can’t cancel your attack, allowing you to do what you can to KO your targeted opponent"

gt3pl8,Game idea!!! RPG,Hi! So I don’t know anything about video game making but I have an idea for an RPG game that I think would be interesting I’m not looking to get paid or anything I just want my idea to be heard and see how things go so I can play
gt2s7a,Interdimensional FPS,"Essentially, I thought it would be cool if therr were a sci-fi FPS where you have to go back and forth or more ways between dimensions which co-exist in the same space, and to have a device that would shift objects or even parts of the world into a target dimension. Like use it on a chair to send it to an other dimensional space where you need the chair to reach somewhere.\n\nI also thought if it had a space setting, there could be areas where you're in a space station, and switching dimensions can't help because the other side only has empty space. Maybe a suit could let you survive that long enough to shift back.\n\nOn planet surfaces, there could be structures and even geography that differ, so the player is exploring multiple worlds at once.\n\nI initially thought that there should be weapons that only work in this or that dimension, because the physics of those dimensions could hypothetically differ while a magic suit of plot armor protects the player's character from destabilization; but weapons might not be able to get such a treatment. It would complicate things, but maybe it would be appropriate for like some alien stuff to only work in their world until later on you get a new toy that unlocks usage in all dimensions.\n\nI thought it seemed like a kinda cool thing, but of course I'm never gonna make it :)"
gszc1a,"Chess... but whith skins, emoticons, special moves etc...","I love to play chess, but i can see why the youth don't mind it. Same pieces, same everything. A game about two reins in war could be more... cool.\n\nBut imagine if you move the queen it turns to life, like a real queen with armor and sword, and make a magical hit to destroy the oponent? You could buy special moves with coins, or maybe you want an army of elfs? dwarves? Or you want your piecea to do a winning dance after the match? The possibilities here are infinite.\n\nThe clock would stop during the animations, of course. And you couldn't buy powers that would make you stronger in the game, it's just for the aesthetics.\n\nWhat do you think?"

gsqa5z,Single player MMORPG-like,"this is totally ripping off Final Fantasy 12's combat system but with a more ""freer"" approach and greater chance for role playing like The Elder Scroll series, where you make your own character, go out adventuring, joining guilds, completing sidequests, building a home, get married, participate in various activities, all at your own pace without worrying some linear and restricted story.\n\nThere *is* a story, but its up to you to pursue that, maybe it's an open-ended story, like you have 1,000,000G debt to pay in limited time but the only quests that can give big enough money in time lead you to the process of uncovering some kind of bigger plan. Failing to pay the debt within time limit will grant you a permanent hostile stance from the creditor's faction so you have to kill the leader, etc. etc.\n\nCombat is similar to games like FF12 or Dragon Age:Origins, just pick a target and choose a command so it'll not be the focus. Focus on the game will be on other side activities, the *not being a hero* activities like building your own family, a house, farming (a much simplified version), making children, etc. if you want a peace, but you can also be a gladiator in the arena or a mercenary or just a freelancer taking odd jobs or a gambler in casino city. You can climb a guild's rank by completing various side missions for that guild. \n\nMultiplayer implemented is PvE / Co-op and restricted PvP. PvE is only for friends or you can join an open 'room' to aid strangers in raiding some bosses that is very optional, doable in single player but easier in co-op. PvP is very restricted, maybe it's in a special place like underground fighting pit, where you can wage an item to be taken by the winner to enter, you need to wage an item with similar quality.\n\nMaybe there's also a pretty intricate crafting system that the created item's power is related to your skill in said crafting skill (like smithing for weapons/armors, alchemy for potions/poisons, cooking for foods/drinks, runecrafting for runes, etc.) and you can sell your personally-made item in the online trading board in-game, a somewhat online shop but it's by players and for players.\n\nYou can also export your character to be hired by other players like in Dragon's Dogma pawn system, where your character's knowledge of enemies, area, and sidequests will be helpful to another player."
gsq70v,Map ideas for an FPS,I'm making an FPS game and I was wondering if you guys had any unique an interesting map ideas.
gsn2v9,one ability man (part 2:) mini games and multiplayer,"so the mini games can be done with multiple people nut the more people playing at once the more enemies there will be. and there is an online but you must have at least two bars to go online and when i make this game i will try to have the online modes good quality and with little-to-no lag and the modes there are will be: race to the finish, elimination, 2v2 and more (that i cant think of right now). now heres how each mode will work race to the finish: there are no enemies getting in your way but theres a black hole chasing you down and the last player to get to the finish will be eaten by the black hole and the first person there gets a five second head start in the next round and you can avoid be eaten by the hole but you'll need to do some parkour as the black hole pulls you in if you are eatten, you'll just get matched will three other people. now for: elimination, elimination is a mode where you have to kill the most enemies before getting to a checkpoint (5 in total) and if you have the most enemies down, you'll be able to proceed but if you have the least enemies down, you automatically die. now for 2v2: there is no explanation for this because is says it for itself but theres one change in 2v2: you cant use the double gear"
gsm3pj,A game mixing KSP and Satisfactory,"Hello folks. I imagine a game that mix rocket engineer, like Kerbal Space Program and a building system like Satisfactory game. The ideia is a full planetary colonization game, where you will be a engineer, that builds rockets and make planetary colony, in a history mode, starting in the moon. With specific scientific missions, like build a little Dyson sphere, moon base for far planetary missions, a Mars base. Spacial elevators... Talking about Mars, I think it would be interesting a mission for build a atmosphere using atomic bombs. Everything based on true science with fake planets. and after colonizing a planet you could do missions remotely, where you just have to wait for the rockets with resources to arrive as you advance your construction on the planet. At the same time, you could return to you rocket base at Earth to create another ships and do researches. The majn ideia is to colony all the solar system and make scientific advance, like a Dyson Sphere... What you guys think? (Sorry for the bad English)"
gsli0o,L4D2 But its D&amp;D. (with bells and whistles.),"Exactly what it says on the tin. \n\n""But what about Vermintide?"": Vermintide is similar to want I'm wanting, but doesn't exactly scratch the itch. (also, the cost of vermintide is considerable versus the cost of L4D2.)\n\nIt would probably be more like a mod for L4D2/Vermintide itself than anything, but really I'm kinda wanting a D&amp;D inspired apocalyptic co-op fighter/shooter that takes place in a dark campaign in a world ridden with undead and evils of all sorts (thanks to the evil gods getting full dominion and fighting over it or something like that.) , with some RPG mechanics to boot along some more customization. \n\nIt would basically kind of act like a bridge between Vermintide and L4D2. But you can choose your character's class, subclass, and their specific spells/powers available if they have any. Kinda like if you were to choose the wizard character, you could choose two 3rd Tier spells such as fireball, lightning bolt, wall of sand, etc, which give different advantages, buffs, and usages depending on what you pick, Sure fireball would be basically a three use molotov (with some direct damage.) until you recover some 3rd Tier spell slots in the field. However if you're not an evocation wizard, you can severely injure your allies with it. In that case, you might choose lighting bolt so that it's half as destructive but easier aimed to not harm your friends whilst battling the hordes. \n\nTLDR: L4D2 but it's based on D&amp;D stuff with class and spell customization to create synergies with your buddies."
gsjf2r,Horror game with personal physics,"I wasn't sure how to word that... Basically, you're walking through the woods, and you see something like a small meteor heading straight down at you. You fall backwards, but it slows above you, turns, and hits ground somewhere close by, out of view of the path.\n\nThe goal is simple enough. Follow the path til it merges with the lit parking lot, where you get in, and drive away. Only, whatever was in that ""meteor"" is now in the woods with you, and they're looking for a snack before hitting the road. You're the snack.\n\nYou've got a flashlight (what? I know it's cliche as hell.). It doesn't require batteries, as if you'd find them. It is a nice big metal flashlight that you can knock the crap out of something with. When you swing it, the light beam changes direction. So you're now blind to whatever you just swung for. If you hear a CRACK you got it. Otherwise, you'll hear a scurry into the bushes.\n\nThe main feature I'd like to see is critters flanking you, and ramming you in the legs, knocking you down. Now a pivot-ground-view, you need to grab the flashlight in front of you, and swipe any creatures as they come for you. Once clear, you need to get up, and continue on your way. As an Aliens fan, I'd love to see the main attack of the critters to be something akin to a face hugger.\n\nI think constant running would be a good feature, with no ability to walk, and a point where you need to stop in place, and catch your breath, leaning over. If the critters ram you while you're catching your breath, you fall like I mentioned above. If they ram you while running, you get more of a jolt.\n\nThe main point of the game isn't the critters so much as the jarring perspective of the character as he falls, and has to defend himself while lying on the floor, even for a few seconds."
gshb32,A game where you dig mines like they did 100 years ago.,"So, I’m really in to a couple YouTube channels where people explore abandoned mines, and I’ve been looking with no success to find a game that captures that thrill. \n\nI know what you’re thinking, “what about minecraft?”, and to that I’ll say that minecraft barely scratches the surface of what it is to mine, with none of the dangers, barely any ore, unlimited inventories, etc.\n\nNo, clearly from these videos it’s apparent that a lot of work went into building some of these old mines. The men who dig them had to know their geology, when and where to build supports, lay down tracks for orecarts, haul and dump the rock they dug(often chucking them down the sides of mountains, or backfilling, creating stopes, false floors, hoists, ladders, chutes, etc. \n\nI want a game that can recreate that thrill. A game where you take on the roll of a miner in the early 1900’s, and dig your mine in the same ways they did. \n\n- the game should be procedurally generates above and below ground, and should NOT be made out of cubes like minecraft was. Ultimate sandbox where the player is the master of his world, tunnel deep and setting up a camp above ground. \n\n- different geology, some solid and some unstable and prone to collapse\n\n- timbering, and building with wood. Allow players to build with wood underground in planks and logs, allowing them to figure out for themselves the best designs. \n\n- multi-directional tunneling. One of the most fascinating things I’ve noticed about some of these old mines is that sometimes they dug in unusual ways to maximise the ore return, often digging straight down, diagonally, and leaving fatal pits all over the place\n\n- natural dangers, including collapse, flooding, rot from moister, fall damage, deadly gas, and more! \n\n- actually having to remove fill and dump it outside. \n\n- a use for money, including upgrades, tools, and better above ground facilities or equipment. Think things you’d actually want or care about in real life, or things that would help your mine continue and succeed\n\n- deep, dark, and hot. Lighting and ventilation are important, and would be things the player needs to think about as he ventures deeper into the earth. Some mines had electrical wires, some even had plumbing for air.\n\n- maybe throw in some fantasy elements if you want to give the game some personality. I’m thinking a cartoon aesthetic would be more appealing to the eyes than overly realistic\n\nFor better understanding of what I’m talking about, I’ll link some YouTube videos of abandoned mines."
gsg2dq,A Purge game that works on a real time clock,"This game would involve u being a random citizen in a small neighbourhood - large city depending on the server, and u just going about ur day. \n\nBut then say every real life week, say a Sunday, the Purge starts and u have to survive until it's over. If u do, u get to keep the weapons and loot u stole into the next week (similar to escape from tarkov).

There's so much u could do with this concept but I feel like I'm not creative enough to think of much more else."

gsb0j1,"An escort mission, but you're the one being escorted","This is a little bit of a reverse-ideology for contemporary gaming tropes.\n\nThe player is the one being safeguarded by their companion through the game/world. Enemies are too powerful for the player, or the player is too fragile (or small) \n\nThe challenge? The player has to provide all manner of support for their protector, which includes finding ammo for them, giving them bark-like commands (""behind you!!"" or ""get down! Grenade!!

gs3ap9,A NFS game concept,"Greetings to you all!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecently I ended up with a conclusion that realy bothers me, that NFS games are getting less and less interesting as the years are passing by, and that is trully sad, cause we used to love NFS games long ago, when NFS underground was the must-have racing game for all platforms. So what happened? Why those games were left to play only by casual gamers? And how this could change in one single game. This is my own suggestion-concept about a new NFS game that will really hit the market and will bring back all the hardcore racing gamers that have been astray from the good old days (for a good reason).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRACING GAMEPLAY\n\n As a racing gamer myself, i always prefered Realism over Arcade racing games, and that's sure my own personal taste. Racing Games can be fun when being realistic, if they are made the right way.\n\nSo, to begin with , gameplay should be realistic in its core, but with options to make the game easier for arcade users. Assists and realism effects could be switched on or off depending on the gamer desires, not too many option to bother with on the easy modes just some presets, and just leave the hardcore settings for the realistic mode, that we, the sim racers trully love. The racing experience should like Project cars (Shift 1 and 2 winkwink). Camera effects should make the game feel immersive, so the DOF should be set in a way that cars really feel like accelarating and not that stupid close up that totally drains the experience. Camera shake, accelarating effects and cornering shake is a good way to start with. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCAR POOL\n\n Let's move on now on the hot stuff, the car pool. Cars should be no more than 100-150. Exotic cars should be less than everyday cars.  Give us the good old cars, Honda civic 98 Nissan GTR skyline, Toyota supra and so on. Exotic cars should not be the core of this game's car pool in my opinion. Everyday cars and more sport cars should be what this game focuses on, and thus the real progression should come via upgrades and modifications , which leads me on the next subject.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCAR CUSTOMIZATION-MODIFICATION\n\n Modifications was always the core of NFS games. Making a car trully yours comes from the modification options. Thus the game should have a ton of modifications. Changing rims, bumbers rear and front, headlights, grills, hoods, exhausts, rear wings etc. As for the perfomance upgrades a detail list of improvements racing flywheels customizable gearboxes turbo stages, aftermarket exhausts suspensions and many more. Those are what most race gamers really want. The customization options should give the player the feeling that his car is UNIQUE amongst others. Let's not forget the paint customizations and the vinyls you can customly attach on your car. Also the player should have the option to change the car's interior, to a more sporty look giving them some option to play with. Engine bay also should be able to view if needed, so someone could see the new parts he installed.Look customization parts should be unlocked at every stage of the game while the car improvements should unlock as the player progress levels. And that really sums it up for the car customization.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nENVIROMENT DESIGN - STAGE DESIGN\n\nThe next topic is the racing enviroment. I consider a enviroment that feels real in many ways, first of all, the game should be set on a city along  with some suburban districts and peripheral highways. Traffic should be present with some AI cars giving the player the option to have fun with AI drivers by overtaking them or challenging them to a quick race if they re willing to do so. AI drivers should be sometimes aggressive and not always calm and easy. That gives some immersion when you are just having a free ride. Dynamic weather and Day- Night cycle is also a must-have. Also some places of interest should exist, for example Home garages for your cars , paint shops , garages for modifications, used-car sale yards or shops, gas stations for refueling your car, dyno shops and also some carwash stations. That really gives the player the reason to free-ride. As for the existence of police i guess that is a no no. I think that this whole concept of police chases has gotten too far to be fun anymore. \n\n Let's move now on a another topic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n RACE MODES\n\nRace game modes should be the fun part of the game. First we have the Normal race, the players are given a circuit marked on their map that they must compete inside with other players with a max number of 4. Drag races from a red light to another. High speed runs against other players in highways and also drifting contests. Also a good idea would be to create some race circuits for player to contest with each other in a real racing enviroment if they are willing to do so. Each win should grant the player credits. Also tournaments or contest could held in the game every day for players to compete against each other in different racing scenarios.\n\n Now it is time for another important part of the Game.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGAME PROGRESS AND IN-GAME STATS\n\nThe game should have Level Progress , that increases with completing given tasks winning Races and Completing in game-achievements. Levels will unlock Cars available improvement mods and some unique custom looks. Also via the level progress some unique cars will be available. Achievements should give the player four type of rewards EXP ,credits , reputation and some unique aesthetic parts. Credits should be used for buying cars, buying car parts , painting the car washing it and refueling it etc. Also to enter some tournaments credits will be required. Reputation will be gained the more you win races vs Real players. The more races you lose the less reputation you will have, thus the progress depends on how well you do on racing against others and so creating a type of mmr system. Reputation will grant you unique parts for the exterior of the car. And some badges to accompany your gamer tag. Finally the game could have some DLC options that will be available in the game store and by purchasing them the player will have access to new in-game material, like unique cars and exterior parts. Finally the game should have the car ranking meter given player the stats of their car in order to be a fair competition, and so only cars with close ranking points can compete against each other.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nConclusion- Final words\n\nSo i really think that those sum it up. Even though this design suggestions guide its not as detailed as I would wish it to be, it is what I believe a new NFS game needs to have in its core design ,in order to attract the players the NFS series lost due to consistent bad game designs and over the top arcade setups, while at the same time keeping the players who already enjoying the Arcade side of the NFS series. Thank you all for taking the time to read this post, feel free to reply and suggest your own design concepts and ideas , and let people that work for the NFS series inform about what we trully want.\n\nCheers\n\nDrakelord94"
gs1arh,A Conker's Bad Fur Day-esq JRPG,I have no idea what to say beyond self-aware humor and a generic jrpg plot getting completely derailed
gs14po,"The Wanderer &lt;Horror, Adventure&gt;","You are locked in an office building with nothing but your wits to survive, well that and the conveniently hidden potted plants to hide in.\n\nThe goal of the game is to find a way to escape the entity which will be known as ""The Wanderer"". Through potted plants, boxes of files, and desks, the player will continue through the office finding items such as keys, key cards, and tools to complete tasks. \n\nThe layout of the floor will stay the same throughout the game.  The floor design will repeat five times and each time it repeats the rooms get more and more horrific. A big part of the game is feeling the suspense with the occasional jump scare. A shadow constantly follows you around giving you a feeling like you're always being watched. Flickering lights will provide a way to see and also provide to the atmosphere. The thunderstorm happening outside the will have sounds of rain and thunder with the occasional lightning strike appearing through the window. This will also help add to the atmosphere of the game. \n\nThe lore of the game will be conveyed through audio logs scattered around the game. The whispers that are said by ""The Wanderer"" will also provide more clues to the lore.\n\nThe escape from the office building at the end of the fifth repeated floor hallway will be shining white. This can allow the player to interpret the ending however they want, if it was all just a dream, reality, or even death.\n\nThe only thing I request for the idea is credit, that is all.\n\nI'll answer any questions down below in the comments.\n\nAbout Me:\n\nI have designed a lot of games but none of them have become a reality. I don't have the time to work on any of the projects. This idea is one of many I have, it is not the best idea I have. The other ideas I don't feel comfortable as they are really good and I would like them to be under my own name. They are also much larger projects and they do not seem right to post here. Sorry for the spiel but I just wanted to provide some background. Hope you all enjoyed!!!"
