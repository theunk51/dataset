b0w253,Developer seeking puzzle ideas for mobile,"I'm looking for original simple puzzle ideas and original game mechanics for a mobile game.  I can handle the technical challenges, but if you would like to be a part of the development process and be credited as the designer, my discord is jswerveholby#3945\n\nsome examples of games that fit what I'm looking for:\nRoll the Ball\nFlow Free\n2048\nSlice Shapes\nUnblock Me\nBejeweled\nCut the Rope\n\nI'm aiming for something that is simple with feel good original mechanics, with levels that progress in difficulty.  Concepts should be simple enough that a mobile user could jump into it and start playing right away. "
b5hdik,Something like Stubbs The Zombie,"Well, I think most of you know Stubbs the Zombie, a game where you play as a zombie and infect the world, I think we need an open world game where you start as a Patient Zero, maybe in a rural area, so it can be easier in start, and infect towns and cities one by one leading your zombie army, I think a game like this would be a very good one, I open to your comments on this, thanks."
b5g6uw,VR Time Travel game,"Free movement is one of the big unsolved problems in VR.  Games where the player stays in a single place work much better (and less nauseatingly), in my experience. \n\nSo if we don't want to move through *space*, the game should move through *time*.  The player would stay at a single location, but have the ability to jump through many different time periods.  \n\nThe gameplay could involve time-based puzzles, like planting a seed in one era and then jumping forward 30 years to see a new tree there.  Of if there's a smashed piece of pottery, the player could travel back in time to when it was whole, to get an idea of what it should look like when reassembled.  \n\nThis is pretty vague I know, I guess I'm picturing a puzzle-solving game like The Room, but in VR and with time travel.  "
b5f7e4,"I have no experience in the video game industry, i'm an AutoCAD drafter haha, but after watching Love, Death and Robots..the suits short inspired me to come up with this idea.","Humanity first began to seek out another home in the year 2100, overpopulation and war drove them to this need. When Terra was first discovered, it fit all of the criterion, an atmosphere that was practically live able that would require only minor terraforming, as well as gravity identical to earth. A coalition of nations came together, funded by the governments as well as private corporations to launch the first expedition. In the year 2150, the first manned space mission was launched. Using new found nuclear fission technology, created by a company call atlas, that would be able to create faster than light travel, the ship that went was massive, but would be able to carry the first humans to the planet. On board was everything humanity would need to begin their new life. At first colonization went effortlessly, multiple expeditions were made, a unified government was formed, cities began to be constructed\n\nIn the year 2250, humanity tried to expand, but the invading force made that almost impossible, the invasion force of these bug like creatures was overwhelming, humanity fought, but it was soon clear that the war would be lost. Humanity evacuated its cities and fled, when they reached out to earth for help… the call was never answered.\n\nIn 2350, humanities life on Terra had changed drastically. Their planned sprawling metropolises were never completed, the barren landscape resembled a mix of 1800s America as well as a cyberpunk future. Life on the planet was made up of colonies of settlements, mostly farming settlements connected with railroads that had been built originally as fast means of transportation between cities, rather than trying to keep up maintenance on the trains, steam power seemed to be the best option, heavily armored trains went between the settlements as needed. The crown jewel of humanity in this post apocalyptic world were their dreadnaughts. Mechs built by farmers to defend their settlements. Expensive and costly to maintain, they were powered by modified fusion tech from ATLAS. The mechs never left the settlements as their reliability was questionable. Settlements were protected with defense grids and soldiers and large forcefield like domes had been erected all over the planet to try and keep humans safe.\n\nOur story follows Alex, a farmer who lives in Archer Settlement, Alex is 28 years old, married to Danielle (26), and was born in a neighboring settlement, his settlement was destroyed when he was 16 and he commandeered his father’s dreadnought and escaped. Luckily archer settlement wasn’t too far, as venturing into the wilds in a dreadnought, especially a damaged one, was quite dangerous. When he got there, he was taken in by Danielle’s parents. Over time he repaired his dreadnaught and worked on the farm. Learning from other Dreadnaught pilots in the settlement, he became quite the pilot and mechanic. When Alex was 25 years old, he had been living a very fulfilling life, he defended the settlement with other pilots when needed and eventually married Danielle. As a wedding gift, her parents left them the farm, as they no longer wanted the responsibility of it and felt they deserved it, Her dad ended up purchasing the bar in the town a few miles away, still within their settlements forcefield and her parents now live in town. Her parents both work at the bar.\n\nIt would be revealed later in the plot that humanity was actually the invading force of this planet, the creatures here were living peacefully, the initial colonization force forced them back underground and even captured some to experiment on to create super soldiers from…obviously that backfired.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe game would be an open world RPG, you would play as Alex, the game would begin with his life at 16 and then jump to the future where he is living on his farm. The game would blend settlement management with your farm, with choices and conversations like a bio ware game as well as mech combat and on foot combat. The overarching story would lead to Alex learning about earth, the secrets of ATLAS and the choices made would lead to the fate of the planet and characters.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not much of a writer and I would love to write a book or something with this story. I've always wanted to do some sort of project blending scifi and mechs and suits has inspired me to do so."
b5e47u,Turok Remake,"So I just bought Turok for the Switch. I'm not exactly old enough to be in the generation that has N64 nostalgia, but I was raised with both modern games and movies and classics. My dad had an N64 when I was like 5 or 6, and one of the few games I remembered was Turok, so I got it. It's pretty fun, but I haf an idea, since I wish to make video games and/or movies in the future. Turok remake. I have two wishes for a Turok remake. The first idea is an open world game, admittedly very similar to a Far Cry game. The second idea is a reboot similar to Wolfensfein and Doom. I haven't thought of much else, since I just haf the idea like 40 minutes ago. Idk i wanted to share since, as I said, I want to make games"
b5ca3z,Has 2001 ever been done as a game?,We are approaching a moment when 2001 technology looks plausible:\n\nWe have Reaction Engines Skylon space plane being looked into: \n\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-47585433\n\nThere are a lot of talks of space stations like this one from Gateway foundation: \n\nhttps://youtu.be/vTNP01Sg-Ss\n\nAI's are getting better every single day. \n\nElon Musk is talking about going to Mars and Moon. \n\nThe world of 2001 is not only possible. But at this point it seems like something that WILL happen. \n\nWhy not make a game out of 2001? Making it possible to explore the Space Station V. The Clavius space station and other locations. \n\nMaybe make the game to happen simultaneously with the movie plot. As a person who is doing something relating to the main movie plot. Where his actions make the main movie plot able to continue. \n\nMaybe fighting the Russians who are trying to discover what is going on? Trying to decode the monolith and its secrets. A plot that is tied 100 percent to the movie plot line. \n\nIt would not be the easiest plot line to write. But I imagine it could be done. \n\nI understand a lot of people would think it would be a sacrilege and it might be nigh impossible to get the rights from the Kubrick right holders.. But what do you think?
b4zvku,I want to create a game inspired by John Wick and other action games and movies combined,"He would of lost his entire family from a bunch of thugs but he managed to survive and escape from out of the house all beaten and bruised up from his burning home and his family already dead. He would now decide to take up any training he can to get his revenge on those who did this, you will need to discover clues, find names, figure out who those thugs were, it will be a big story that will lead to other bad crime organizations and other bad guys hidden in the secret world, like assassins, Russian mafia, yakuza, Italia mafia, drug lords and all sorts of others you discover into this underworld of bad guys involved in your families killings. You start out as an ordinary guy but after this traumatic experience you now have to create your own path and will determine the story you go into. Like you can start taking shooting lessons, develop skills get yourself into some kind of combat training, even martial art skills training, find secret societies to train in go look and search for the best methods to become your now vigilante. and uncover the truth with betrayal and all sorts of different paths to take and you can even get specific characters to help you out depending on the paths you take.\n\nHow does my ideas and game mechanics sound?"
b4u72s,Two interest checks: a comics making management and game with changing world,"Hello,\n\nI am now already considering possibilities for my next game. \n\nWhile for some of them, I really need to make a good profit with my current game, some can be done with low budget.\n\nAnd of course I can always continue doing adventure games, but I am eager to try something more complex and interesting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, for now I offer you two possible game ideas:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) A dungeon crawler style RPG, game where the game world is flat, and camera can only be turned by 90 degrees each time.\n\nYou'll say: there are many games like of this style, and the idea is anything but new.\n\nSo, I want to try really non-generic feature - the game world will be changing during gameplay.\n\nThere are a few ways to implement this, so to make it easier, I made a survey:\n\n[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfJBkgcbCIcsYKHzo6jUtlAQJkGh4wEYnRIl-vPMXZuO0obJQ/viewform?usp=sf\_link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfJBkgcbCIcsYKHzo6jUtlAQJkGh4wEYnRIl-vPMXZuO0obJQ/viewform?usp=sf_link)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) A comics making company management. A tycoon game, in a style close game development tycoons, but about making comics. The player will also have to find good fits of graphic style and story, advertise comics, make decisions that will have different consequences and so on. For now, I didn't prepare any surveys or more detailed plan.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, please tell me what you think about both ideas."
b4tvn4,A game full of powerful gods who's whims you turn against them.,"(This was inspired partly through Sekiro and partly through starting Spice and Wolf)\n\nIn games I find that you usually have main character syndrome and don't care about the enemies at all. You think of bosses as challenges or obstacles that although they might be tough, you never doubt you have the ability to defeat them. This brings me to my idea. \n\nWhat if you play as an average citizen of a town ruled by whimsical gods. People have all these superstitions that you're forced to follow or else you get severely punished by curses. These are very real and plot wise your character becomes sick of it. The game is about ridding the town of having to do all this superstitious stuff all the time. You do this by pulling some Greek mythology-like shenanigans (completely different game wise but that type of thing.) \n\nEach god/higher entity is very powerful and there's no way you can defeat them through strength. Your character might have mild combat ability but you should genuinely fear these beings. They should be very fast and very strong, being out of the question to even try combat.\n\nWhat you *can* do however is secretly scheme and disable/redirect these god's places of influence. Say there's a fire god who will start setting nearby surroundings on fire if you don't keep a certain lantern lit and a harvest god who demands a large percentage of your crops who's terrified of fire. You could wait for the harvest god to come for his share of crops and then put the lantern out. This would scare away the harvest god and your crop problem would be solved. \n\nIt's a complicated idea but the main theme is to have very scary beings that make your village do annoying stuff all the time to appease them and your job is to either use their curses to cancel each other out or possibly conquer their places of power. Ideally a cool mythos would help a lot."
b4s2km,"Good Boy, A Zany Post-Apocalyptic Survival Game (in which you are a dog)","This is a long description of a game idea I had that I wanted opinions on. I wrote this out as if it existed, but don't for a second think that it currently does. However, if someone were to read this and decide ""imma make that,"" it would be pretty nice if I could at least get a message or two saying that so I can at least get some credit. Some cut of profits as the originator would be nice too. Anyways, on with the game itself.\n\n#**Premise**\n\nGood Boy would be a free-roam survival simulator focused on building up and supplying a small base for you and your family. There would be a ‘story mode’ of levels which change as the family moves across a post-apocalyptic US. Each level is a different open area of increasing difficulty. Beyond this there would be a randomly generated ‘endless mode’ where the map resources and enemies regenerate after every day that passes. \n\nAlso, you are a dog.\n\nYes, that’s right, a dog. You start as a standard, rather typical yellow Labrador retriever, and your family are the Joneses: Daniel, the accountant father of the family who peaked in High School; Carol, the paralegal mother who got married when she had kids at 18; Sarah, the eldest child at 17, who has a rebellious and pessimistic attitude; and Jake, the ever optimistic 12 year old boy who loves you dearly. Approximately 3 months ago, the world ended. We’ll get to how in a second.\n\nBut first, like I mentioned, you’re a dog. A very loyal dog, and a very smart one. You also happen to have a strong resistance to any diseases, rather adaptive genes, and an impressive healing rate. Isn’t that nifty? And it’s quite luckily the Joneses have you around, because they, to put it bluntly, really f*cking suck at surviving. This isn’t to say they’re totally helpless, nor are they absolute morons who you’ll have to worry about getting killed all the time. No the biggest problems are a lack of necessary skills, constant bickering, and ever dwindling mental and physical health. These basic suburbanites aren’t exactly the type for surviving the end of the world, but, damn it, you’re going to try your best to ensure they do. Why? Because you’re a very good boy.\n\n#**The Basics**\n\nSo what does this entail? First it’s going to mean getting them supplies. At first, this means going out and searching for what’s most essential, as you can only take one item at a time in your mouth to start (Opposable thumbs sure would sound good, eh?). Don’t fret, you’ll soon have a rag to carry a few items in but wrapping them in the rag as you carry it in your mouth. Then you can get a neck pouch for small items, a sack to drag, and then an actual backpack you get on and off by pulling on cords. Canned food, weapons, ammunition, medicine, tape, even things to help boost their sanity, you must go out and retrieve them. As you bring the supplies, the Joneses will make use of them. Daniel was an accountant and Carol had a health nut and minimal living phase so they know how to ration and how to make use of their limited resources. No need to worry about reminding them to eat or treat their wounds (Though their rate of consumption/thoughtless consumption can be modified).\n\nBut it isn’t just resources. You are a good boy, but sometimes good boys have to do bad things. Like killing. You’ll have animals to scare off or kill, possibly as meat for your family, though you’ll have to bring the meat back home for that, and some won’t be healthy for them. But there will also be bandits a plenty, or even zombies (and you’re thankfully immune!), that you will have to kill to keep your family safe, especially since knowledge of a family of only 4 with good resources means they are bound to get attacked. Finding tools and supplies will allow the Joneses to fortify and improve their living, and getting them weapons will mean they can fight back without you. \n\n#**Apocalypse Mechanics**\n\nBut critical resources and enemy types, as well as the environment, will depend greatly on just *how* the world ended. It can be one of three reasons in the endless mode, but it is all three in the story, just to lessened degrees:\n\n1 - *The Nuclear Apocalypse:* War erupted between powerblocs of nuclear armed nations and mutually assured destruction was set to commence. Missile defense systems, however means it was most just major cities that were hit, and the power grids failed. The wilderness is safe from any deadly radiation, but you still have to watch for radiation sickness, and there are, of course, the plethora of bandits and newly mutated creatures **(Easy Mode)**\n\n2 - *The Zombie Apocalypse:* Foolish governments tested one too many biological weapons, and a breach in containment meant that soon a necrotic plague was hitting the Earth. The dead rise and a bite means infection. A preventative drug was developed, as well as a treatment for early infection, but far too late. All that could be done was dropping shipments across the world as civilization collapsed. You will need to find supplies, particularly medicine, and deal with the zombies and zombified animals. **(MEDIUM MODE)**\n\n3 - *The Natural Apocalypse:* After years of foolish pollution, climate change and human development have caused the end of civilization as seas rose, earthquakes triggered, and super-volcanoes like Yellowstone erupted. The rapidly altered environment will make resources scarce, and yet survival is all the more difficult, and with bands of desperate survivors fighting over scraps and dangerous animals roaming the land in a new and unstable food chain. **(HARD MODE)**\n\n4 - *The Supernatural Apocalypse:* So, turns out that Vampires, Werewolves, Demons, and a plethora of other creatures are real, and were, for the most part, kept in check and out of sight. But it seems some idiot did some kind of ritual that not only unleashed the forces of darkness from another dimension onto Earth, but empowered and emboldened the ones already here. Supplies will be plentiful, but it will be incredibly dangerous, with monsters at every turn. **(ALT HARD MODE)**\n\n5 - *The Tetrapocalypse:* First it was a war between nations, one that grew desperate until nukes were launched, but sabotage of energy grids and computer systems meant only a handful sprinkled the each countries’ cities. But in response to the tectonic force of the bombs and the release of heat and flame, earthquakes came and several volcanoes erupted as the seas sharply rose. To make things worse, this was all because of the manipulations of some demonic cult that decided the Earth was now ready for all manner of monster to roam it. And amidst all of this a bioweapon in the form of a zombie plague was unleashed, slowly spreading around the world. The Joneses are trying to survive in this madness, but the sparse nuking, more controlled climate change, a thankfully incompetent cult, and far less rapid zombie plague means that supplies are plentiful to those who can find them, but so are zombies, mutated animals, and bandit-survivors. **(STORY MODE)** \n\n5 - *The F*cking All-pocalypse:* Like in Story Mode’s Tretrapocalypse, all four Apocalypses hit, but each are at full strength. Super-eruptions, mega-hurricanes, demon swarms, vampire covens, zombie hordes, a virulent plague, insane survivalists and a thorough nuclear bombardment are all in effect. Resources will be hard to find but high in demand on all accounts. **(EXTREME MODE)**\n\n6 - *The Custom Apocalypse:* You choose which apocalypses are in effect and their severity, as well as resource wealth, enemy difficulty, and how incompetent the Joneses are.\n\nEach apocalypse has some unique resources or unique variants. \n\nMedicine is a perfect example. In any kind of Nuclear Apocalypse, you will need to find Nuke-B-Gone, which helps the Joneses deal with any radiation they absorb, especially from food. Furthermore, there are mutated foods that can grant them some buffs, albeit at a radiation spike. In any kind of Zombie Apocalypse, the medicine needed is the Infectious Necrosis Reversal Serum, also known as NecroRev, which reverses the effects of early infection. Alongside that is Z-Resist, which makes someone resistant to getting infected in the first place. In the case of infection with Vampirism and/or Demonic Infection that comes with a Supernatural Apocalypse, you need to find Holy Water and Anointing Oil, as well as a Holy Text, not that you as a dog actually know what religion said text belongs to. In a Natural Apocalypse, the main medical resources are heavy filters and testing kits. Filters help to deal with ash, toxic fumes, and make air breathable, and are also useful in a Nuclear Apocalypse, but heavy filters are needed for the newly hostile environment of a Natural Apocalypse. Testing kits look for any harmful substances that have gotten into water or food, as tends to happen after natural disasters, and is also the equivalent to the Nuclear Apocalypse’s geiger counter.\n\nOn top of resource, the Apocalypse changes enemies. Bandits are found throughout, but in a Nuclear Apocalypse there are also mutated animals, like a glowing, three-headed bear and an acid spewing big snake. In the Natural Apocalypse, regular animals are more present and more aggressive, as well as more varied. In a Zombie Apocalypse, zombified forms of animals are present, which are more durable, but slower, and can cause infection (it’ll wear off on you, but not any Joneses without NecroRev). And in a Supernatural Apocalypse, prepare to come across hellhounds, werewolves, imps, and other monsters, including vampires, who can look human from afar, but reveal themselves as they morph into uncontrollable nosferatu creatures. \n\nSo with those kinds of enemies, you’re probably thinking, “How in the Hell is a dog going to fight all that, or even just survive them long enough to get away?”\n\nI’m glad you asked.\n\n#**Combat &amp; Mutation**\n\nCombat functions in two forms for you: open and stealth. You will want to rely on stealth combat as much as you can, like your lupine ancestors. Keep low, keep slow, and keep in the shadows as you try to get the drop on enemies, killing them silently or at least quickly. At first, this will mostly involve using your teeth to bite at their throats and weakpoints, as well as dragging your target out of sight if possible. In open combat, if you’re unable to get a stealthy kill, you have your teeth as well as your claws some swiping, but your speed at getting in, getting a good bite and tear, and getting out with a jump, roll, or run will be your best asset. Dodging attacks is truly vital. But even still, you can only do so much with these basic moves. What’s a dog to do?\n\nWell, logically you have to alter your genome in horrific ways.\n\nThis introduces mutations. In a Nuclear Apocalypse, the way to do this is rather simple; there are a number of mutated plants and small animals all around. Eating radioactive prey or plants has a chance to mutate you overnight. You’ll gain sharper, longer teeth, more mass, a second head, or a bone spike on your tail, or even small helpful arms. You won’t look pretty, but you will become more lethal, with more moves available. In a Zombie Apocalypse, the plague is an adaptable specimen, so eating zombified flesh has a chance to cause changes, which mostly are defensive, increasing your healing and ability to function while injured, as well as things like thickened bone plates on your sternum, back, or joints, making those areas more durable, or you may even gain a poisonous bite yourself! In a Supernatural Apocalypse, mutation comes from curses, which can come from eating creatures, but also from finding ritual circles and completing them, usually by bringing an ingredient. Rarer but more powerful, curse mutations can give you things like invisibility, incredible speed, near invulnerability to physical attacks, literally being on fire, a scorpion tail, and a plethora of other monstrous changes. These all come with downsides, like needing human blood or being unable to stealth well, to counter their power. Now lastly is the Natural Apocalypse. On the one hand, there is very little logical way to work in a mutation mechanic in a world ravaged by natural disasters. On the other hand, that’s not the way this game is supposed to be. In the Natural Apocalypse, if venturing into the right areas, there is a chance (which can possibly be disabled) to find Mutagen-C, an experimental product being tested when the apocalypse hit. Mutagen-C forces mutation based on environmental stimuli. What this will mean is unlocking useful traits, such as breathing underwater/lung capacity, better night vision, spines in your coat, thicker skin, and other more ‘natural’ changes.\n\nAnd that’s the general breakdown; radioactive mutation is mostly combat focused, zombie mutation is mostly defensive, supernatural curses being highly offensive but with great costs, and natural are general buffs and unlocking abilities, none as powerful as other types but generally useful. In scenarios with more than one kind of apocalypse, you can mix and match the types together. Some mutations that overlap, however, like, say, a hellhound’s scorpion-tail and radiation-induced bone spikes, will cause the older of the two to be overrided. Mutations are also random, so you don’t know what you’ll get.\n\n#**The Joneses &amp; Home**\n\nWhen you begin a level, the Joneses will have set-up shop in a new home of some kind. It may be an abandoned cabin, an old gas station, stranded RV, or some other kind of isolated location that is still close to areas with resources. The Joneses aren’t stupid, they’re just inept. They know they needed weapons, food, and supplies, but don’t know exactly how to get it. You, however, do. This is thanks to the great gift of dogs’; their nose. Using scent, you can pick up on the direction of things like medicine, canned goods, prey, and enemies, a skill you can refine by discovering what new scents are by getting closer. This means you have a means of getting what the Joneses need.\n\nSometimes, however, the Joneses will have to help you rather than the other way around. Finding them weapons will help them defend themselves, but it will also mean you can take one to two of the Joneses with you out into the wilderness. One Jones will have some stealth, though not great, and two will be harder to hide, but they improve with trips out with you. You will mostly need to lead them to caches, which are large amounts of supplies you can’t carry yourself. These might be crates of medicine, whole boxes of food, containers of ammunition, even gun cases. There will also be resources like wood, game, and metal scrap that you can either lead them to harvest or you can have them stay somewhere so you can travel less distance as they packmule supplies. Be warned, as while walking back, their burden means you will need to protect them, and when you yourself are carrying items, unless you have an upgraded pack, you will need to drop it to engage in fighting. \n\nWith wood and scrap, the Joneses can fortify their home, and having supplies means they can go longer in safety. Weapons will help them survive attacks, and you can also bring them books, which will allow them to learn new skills, like making traps, wards, healing items, and so on, some of which will require you finding them certain resources. There is also their mental health to consider. Finding items like chocolate (be sure not to eat any yourself!), beer, board games, fiction books, and other frivolities will improve their sanity. You can also (very rarely) find a sane survivor, who you can protect and lead back home. The Joneses may welcome them if they have enough resources and sanity to be able to tolerate a stranger, who can bring great benefits to the base at the cost of having another mouth to feed, body to heal, and life to protect. These benefits include defenses far superior to what the Joneses can ever learn, a free but small daily supply of a resource like food or medicine, or even a permanent boost to sanity and skills in the field. \n\nThe Joneses can also craft things for you. This includes better packs, which is vital, but also medicinal treats to carry with you at the cost of inventory space, and can grant you small buffs, like blessing you to make all demons take more damage for the day, or a small treatment of Nuke-B-Gone to make you immune to radiation damage for the day. They can also, perhaps most crucially, make you some gear. This includes pads for your feet that makes you quieter, or leather protective gear for more resistance to physical attacks, or even metal armor to give you resistance to bullets. Some of these things will take books to teach, and will need resources gathered, but the Joneses can keep you safer and healthier. You also rest at home, healing damage, and your presence improves their sanity, particularly whoever you choose to cuddle up to for the night. \n\nThe Joneses will also have personal quests and dilemmas you can help with to the best of your ability. Their happiness and safety is your ultimate goal. If a Jones dies, it will be devastating to morale and their ability to provide for themselves, though whoever it is will mean different effects. Daniel’s death will mean poorer rationing, leading to greater need for resources; Carol’s death will mean poorer organization, leading to more mistakes in the field; Sarah’s death will mean greater arguments and poorer stealth, resulting in a higher chance of attacks; and Jake’s death will mean a massive hit to sanity and a negative trend to it without his optimism, requiring more effort to keep it up. Should all the Joneses die, you will too out of grief. In general, Daniel will become reckless if he is the last survivor, Sarah will suicide, and Carol will become withdrawn and wither away without excessive care. Only Jake can go on alone, but he is also the least skilled and poorest at combat, making him very vulnerable. \n\nYou’ll have to do a lot to keep your family safe. You’ll have to do things you may not like, and risk life and limb. You will have to change what you are, be that becoming deformed or even monstrous. But you’ll do it, because no matter what you have to do or what you look like, you know what you are: a good boy.\n"
b4qlip,Rook: The Journey of an Indifferent Usurper,"So...\n\nThere's this really powerful holy man. He is known as the bishop. He becomes absorbed by his fanaticism and comes to believe that the gods have fallen and he must fight their wrongs. To do this he must control them, bring them under his heel. He somehow does this, but not without making a fatal deal. To borrow the necessary power, he must open a portal to a place outside of our little bubble of a universe. He does, he executes his plan, but something comes through and takes root in his mind. Now let's take a step back. After the conception and proclamation of the Bishop's plan, but before its execution, the Rook takes notice. The Rook is a hero; A warrior in plate, who walks the land by direct route, putting to rest evil that crosses his path. He elects to put a stop to the Bishop's scheme. He, unsurprisingly juggernauts his way to the Bishop's very chamber, whereupon he breathes in a cloud of spores, and dies. This is where the game begins. You play as a fungus, who has unknowingly taken the place of the Rook, and is now simply seeking a good place to take root. The first half of the game is stealth-centric, escaping the Bishop's tower-stronghold as you are. Combat becomes more available as you progress, as you grow stronger and the enemies decrease in power and frequency. Bosses begin about a quarter of the way through the game. You finally make it to a peaceful grassy cottage, wherein you find an abandoned and fearful child of the gods. You then right the halfway point boss, Cardinal, a direct underling to the Bishop who, wanting both to destroy the Rook and bring the godling to his master, fights you. Afterwards, your character realizes that not only is the top of the Bishop's tower the best place to take root and release their spores, but that the Bishop's reign must be brought to an end. You then right your way back to the Bishop by a different route, and get there to discover that whatever came through from the outside has warped the Bishop's body and mind beyond repair, and has just fully taken the wheel. You fight the thing, and there ends Rook. Fill in the gaps, my friends.\n\nAlso I thought of it as a Sidescroller but am realizing that might not work. "
b4qcyp,What are some game ideas for a game intended to be relaxing?,
b4puxl,"A game where you wake up late and have to get to work on time, but everything seems to be against you","You wake up in your apartment and see that the time is 6:50 AM. Your shift starts at 7:00 AM SHARP. You have 10 minutes to get to work, but everything screws you over, kind of like an unfair game. The elevator doesn't work. The stairs are being mopped by an angry janitor. Your car doesn't want to start and panics. The bus you decide to ride on gets a flat tire. Your briefcase randomly opens and papers fly everywhere. Cars don't want to stop for the crosswalk. Sometimes you have to even risk your life on getting to work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou can even make it where every time you play there's a different situation. For example, the elevator is broken and the stairs are available one time but the other way around a different play.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere could even be objects you need to find. Insurance papers, your briefcase, money for the bus, a lamp even."
b4m476,Kill Velocity 992 - hardcore street racing game with almost survival-like elements. Thoughts?,"OVERVIEW: \n\nKill Velocity 992 is a hardcore, open world MMORPG street racing game set in the heart of underground car culture during the '90s and early 2000s. However, proceed with caution.\n\nThis game delivers an experience far from what most might be used to. It's a raw and unforgiving simcade, hell-bent on a no compromise and authentic feel. Here there are no second chances, one mistake can mean losing the race, or even, losing your car. \n\nFeaturing a highly realistic soft-body damage model, even the slightest bump can mean a bent wheel, punctured tire or broken axle. Clean driving has never been more important. \n\nKill Velocity 992 features both singleplayer and multiplayer modes. The singleplayer can be considered a sort of sandbox as there are no rules to follow. Simply pick a first car and explore the massive open world the game has to offer. Discover the underground racing scene of the city, or the silent night runners of the various mountain passes. A minimal heads-up-display means you aren't shown where any events are taking place. You'll have to find them yourself by either looking around or researching info that other racers are spreading.\n\nBattles are waged between racers for cash, or if you're feeling extra daring, pink slips. Use the money earned to upgrade and customize your car, with over 500 cosmetic and mechanical mods for each vehicle in the game. This incredibly detailed system allows for builds that you probably never even thought were possible. Purchase from websites, stores, dealerships, junkyards, private owners. You might even get lucky and find something out in the world. If your car gets damaged, you'll have to pay for replacement parts and fit them on. Better performance means more money to be earned, but also more to be lost. Challenge your opponents wisely, and research who they are before putting anything in the pot. Some racers are more aggressive than others, and may purposefully use shady tactics to achieve victory. By racing you'll also earn respect, and the more battles you win, the higher your status. But don't be shady yourself, ramming drivers off the road will only lessen your respect level. Do enough repeated offenses, and your RP will become negative, and racers will want their revenge on you. You'll also be excluded from any higher level events. If there's any goal you should work towards, it's to get positive notoriety and make your way to the top.\n\nAnother reason you'll want to have good relationships with other racers, is that you will then be able to form your own crew or join existing ones, and have full on 4 vs. 4 matches.\n\nThe multiplayer modes are very much the same, except here your opponents will be even tougher and even more unpredictable. The open world is still available to explore, and to do so with your friends. Win races, trade or sell your cars and parts to other players, and again, make your way to the top.\n\nThe game modes in Kill Velocity 992 are quite diverse, including Sprint, Circuit, Drift, Drift Touge, Drag, Outrun and more.\n\nWe hope to see you on the streets soon. Just... Try to stay alive.\n\nKV992\n\n----------\n\nPIMP MY RIDE:\n\nWith Kill Velocity 992, we are determined to bring car customization to a whole new level. Vehicle parts are split into 3 categories: VITAL, FUNCTIONAL and VISUAL. \n\nVITAL parts are ones that the car won't work properly or at all without, no matter if it's something large like an exhaust system or something as tiny as a spark plug. \n\nFUNCTIONAL parts are mostly ones with the purpose of allowing installation of other VITAL parts. Things like screws, mounts and shrouds fall here.\n\nVISUAL parts are as the name suggests. Bumpers, side skirts, hoods, headlights, bodykits, wheels, spoilers, mufflers, engine covers, neons, etc.\n\nEvery part of a car is expertly simulated and available to remove and even add on other compatible cars, you're free to strip a vehicle down to the bare chassis. Engine and drivetrain swaps are also possible, but you better have some deep pockets. You can even combine many parts together to give your ride a truly unique look.\n\nDo keep in mind that changing things like ride height, camber, wheel spacing, etc. will have an impact on performance. Whether it's a positive or negative change is up to you.\n\n----------\n\nTHE PURPLE SKIES:\n\nThe world of Kill Velocity 992 is authentic and diverse on an epic scale. Even just a casual afternoon drive can lead to an unplanned, unscripted spectacle. Whether it's rival crews battling it out, or a massive police chase happening only a block away, anything is possible.\n\nExplore the map to find various hidden treasures, shortcuts, events, etc. You'll want to race at the late night hours to avoid colliding with traffic or having the police spot you. Continued illegal activity will result in an increased heat level, meaning more police cars will be on the lookout and sometimes even being seen could initiate a chase. Lower the heat by changing your car's appearance, or by simply keeping quiet for a while.\n\nHowever, this is not to say you can't race during the day. There are multiple closed drift tracks, circuits and drag strips scattered around the map, allowing you to practice your skills during the daytime and put them to use at night.\n\nThe world is also quite destructible - railings, walls, light posts, buildings, you name it. Clever soft-body physics technology allows procedural destruction of the environment, at a minimal cost to performance. Use this system to your advantage by forming your own shortcuts, or creating obstructions so the police or your opponents can't catch you.\n\nTHIS is your playground.\n\n----------\n\nMY SAFE SPACE:\n\nAll your cars, parts and equipment are stored in your own personal safe house. Anything you buy online is delivered to you in anywhere from a couple of hours to a whole day in real time, depending on the size/class of the product. You can of course go to a parts store, junkyard or private dealer to get the parts quicker, IF they have it in stock. \n\nSafe houses are also useful for getting away from the cops. Successfully get inside while in a cooldown period in order to evade them.\n\n------------\n\nTHE RED, WHITE AND BLUE:\n\nContinuing with the topic of police, the cop A.I. in Kill Velocity 992 doesn't seem like much at first, but don't be fooled. There exist a total of 7 heat levels starting with 0, and with each one up the cops get more aggressive and increasingly difficult to evade. They can also begin roaming the city streets, trying to hunt you down. To lower your heat, you can either change the visual appearance of your car, or simply wait a while until it's clear to go out again.\n\nUse the destructible environment to disable units chasing you, and use your safehouse or cooldown areas as hiding spots. Keep in mind you'll have to be within a cooldown already to use them.\n\nPolice also have a number of utilities at their disposal, such as spike strips and helicopters. They will use effective tactical strategies to box your car in mid-chase or to ram you off the road. If you get busted, you lose your car, and are forced to pay for all damages you've caused and infractions you've committed. \n\nIf by any chance you don't have enough cash to pay up, you are given a limited time to pay off the debt amount. Failure to do this will result in a game over. This means loss of all your property and progress, and you'll have to start it all over again. \n\nSucks to be you."

b4c6nf,Mobile fighting game,"Trying to think of (relatively) simple ideas for a mobile game and came up with this. I know it's not as simple as some games, but there's enough meat to keep me interested in making it I think.\n\nIt's a 1v1 multiplayer brawler/boxing game. Each character has a light attack, heavy attack, and block, but you also assign a certain number of moves that are used by drawing the related pattern. Everyone has access to the same moves, no p2w or unfair advantage nonsense. Using a heavy attack takes stamina, using a move takes even more stamina. Stamina is regenerated over time and by doing light attacks. Blocking works similar to For Honor, where you block in the direction they're swinging. Really, it's just a simplified mobile For Honor lol.\n\nEveryone needs progress and rewards for mobile games to keep them playing, I guess, but I was thinking just cosmetics at most. Not sure if that's enough to keep people playing, though."
b4aejj,"A game I'll never make: In a planet inhabited by machines and ruled by mechanical deities, one robot struggles to uncover the meaning of a secret he was told at his creation: that none of this world was real.","The Lifegivers are the only ones capable of creating a robot. Each one bestows a different gift: a body, a name, a fate, etc. For an untold amount of time, they were all content with endlessly creating. After an untold amount of time, Meskhenet grew tired of endlessly watching the suffering and violence down on the world, endlessly sending her children to their deaths, endlessly making more to replace them. When it came time to instill yet another fate in yet another robot, she whispered a message: ""None of this world is real."" It was such a short, simple programming, but it would lead to the destruction of the entire cycle--after the deaths of many of her brothers, sisters, and children.\n\n**Story:** The game would likely start with the player, the robot, attempting to break out of the Robot Underworld (I don't have many official names but Robot Underworld definitely isn't one of them). They've tried many times to break out, but the underworld is teeming with violent machines, and even when they make their way to the end, bloodthirsty Ammit quickly puts a stop to it before they can even lay a finger on Anubis. However, after yet another failed attempt, the snake of chaos Apep gets a whiff of a good opportunity to do what he does best. I'm not sure exactly how that interaction would go down (fighting Apep would be awesome, having Apep as a friend or guide that pops up every now and then would also be awesome) but regardless, afterwards the player gets a tool or skill that enables them to fight through the Underworld, slay Ammit, and defeat Anubis. I'm not sure what happens from there, but it involves a lot of fighting, until eventually the player gets to the final boss Horus. There they find out Horus is actually a biosuit that housed the last human, left behind by his species for crimes unknown, who spent the rest of his existence creating and programming the foundation for everything as they knew it.\n\n**Setting:** Far future on on a planet, maybe Earth, though if it were it wouldn't really look like anything we'd recognize as Earth. Only the deities have even minor knowledge that humans once existed on the planet, and (this could be tweaked) only Horus and Meskhenet know the truth about their world. The Lifegivers would chill on a big structure way up in the sky, where they'd make their bots and send them down to the planet. I'm not sure if every single deity found in Egyptian mythology would be included, but I am sure their appearance would be more symbolic or inspired and less literal--that way there could be way more interesting bosses than just having Osiris, Isis, etc as human-shaped robots. Additionally, I probably wouldn't stress too much on being too literate or historically accurate, like making sure the Robot Underworld has the Hall of Two Truths or recreating the lore of how certain gods came to be.\n\n**Tone/Aesthetic/Vibe/Also Setting:** Shiny type of future. Think chrome, holographic, rainbow steel, a world with synthwave as its soundtrack. I'd like to go so far into the future that buildings and structures start looking pretty abstract. Let's not worry too much about what the robots use for fuel or why they have emotions or why some robots are vendors and others are criminals. Let's focus more on fast-paced fights in dope shiny robot cities, gleaming chrome pyramids, going toe to toe with a boss who's got a mohawk made of lasers, that type of stuff.\n\n**Gameplay:** I go back and forth between the game being an open world where you're free to roam and the game being more of one boss battle after another and the player experiences the world while traveling to the next boss. Either way, there'd be plenty of fighting with different weapons. After defeating bosses and maybe certain enemies, they'd drop stuff that you could use for yourself, from weapons and armor to things that would change how you fought a bit more; one example is a boss whose torso can spin around while he attacks, so you can defeat him and use that for yourself to overwhelm masses of enemies. Another is taking down a boss with some jetpack wings and then do flying attacks and maybe have access to secret areas.\n\nI'll stop myself from spewing even more and creating an even longer post! Even though I won't get to the point of being able to make such a game, I'm still compelled to think about and work on my little world of murderous robots. I can be terrible at getting what I'm envisioning across so feel free to ask questions or give feedback!"
b43y7x,A simple little incremental game,"This is an idea I've kicked around a bit. The idea is really simple, but could have a lot of complexity. \n\nThe idea is that you are going to take an initial resource and create a chain of creation to a final product. In this case, turning black minicubes into diamond cubes. Yes, cubes. \n\nThe player starts out mining minicubes. The mine is upgradable and produces a set amount of minicubes per second. The player will need to sell the minicubes to start with until they have enough capital to buy the first cube production line - the black cube. The black cube sells for more than the black minicubes, and for a while, the player will need to sell black cubes to reach the next cube. Each cube (apart from the Black Minicubes) have 4 stages of production which can be separately upgraded at cost - grinding, bleaching/dying, compressing, and baking. That fact that each cube production unit (4 per cube) would start at one and then be upgraded means that there are a total of 44 upgradable cube options in the game, plus maybe 3 or 4 options for creating Black Minicubes, meaning that there is a lot of stuff the player would have to sink money into, extending the time it takes to reach the end of the game and doing a reset with potential reset currency. The cubes go as follows: \n\n1. Black Minicubes\n2. Black Cubes\n3. Dark Grey Cubes\n4. Light Grey Cubes\n5. White Cubes\n6. Dark Blue Cubes\n7. Light Blue Cubes\n8. Dark Cyan Cubes\n9. Light Cyan Cubes\n10. Near-Clear Cubes\n11. Clear Cubes\n12. Diamond Cubes\n\nBlack Minicubes sell for $10 each, and each cube sells for around x\^1.28 of the previous cube value. This means that Diamond Cubes would sell for $1,292,923,249,866,192.23 ($1.292 Quadrillion), though you could have upgrades ala AdVenture Capitalist. \n\nI think an interesting alternative switch in this game could be that Black Minicubes could be the chief currency of the game, meaning that the player would have to balance producing cubes while not producing so many that they run out of cash all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn this game, I would like to be involved, if possible, to see how it does. I am something of a write/storyteller, so I might be able to help there, potentially. "
b420jb,DOOM: BFR (BATTLE FUCKING ROYAL),"Title's self explanatory! A DOOM battle royal! Explore a large Mars facility, collecting guns and armour (Guns from DOOM 2016 and DOOM: Annihilation). Killing other DOOM guys and maybe Demons (kinda like zombies in BLACKOUT). \n\n1. I know this is almost impossible, hist thought of the idea and thought y'all might appreciate it\n2. I'm not a fan of Battle Royal, just liked DOOM 2016 and thought it would be pretty neat!\n3. Yeah, I stole the name idea from DOOM: VFR (VIRTUAL FUCKING REALITY)"
b3yvju,Primitive Battle Royale,Can we have a primitive battle royale?  \nwith bows and spears? where half naked humans run arround?\n\nusing traps and stuff? and in the airdrop you can get a revolver with 6 shots and no ammo? =)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthis would be cool .. different charakters and blabla just a simple game...
b3y1op,Super Smash Bros/ Mariokart mashup (super smash kart),"Although there are some non- Nintendo characters in Mariokart like Link and Isabelle, I feel like that it would be interesting to have a racing game with the mechanics of smash bros. \n\n\nCharacters:\nThere will be a roster of all the characters in smash ultimate (plus waluigi).\n\nItem boxes/pickups:\nCan be found in sandbags, confetti capsules (those yellow item balls), and crates throughout the map. On some tracks, you can find rolling crates (which damage you if you don't break it with an item).\n\nItem types:\n\nProjectiles-\nfireballs (mario), bow and arrow (Legend of Zelda), a pokeball which captures a player for a few seconds, then releases them if they shake the remote enough (pokemon), and red/green/blue shells (mario).\n\nTraps-\nBanana peel (Mariokart), pokeball (deploys a random enemy pokemon if thrown backwards), and landmines from metal gear.\n\nHeals/personal boost-\nMega mushroom, food items, maxim tomato, bullet bill, and super star.\n\nVehicles/Rides:\nThere will be a variety of rides from many franchises, including Mario's standard kart/bike, Captain Falcon's blue ship named ""Falcon Flier"", 8-bit motorcycles from Excite Bike, Kirby's warp star and dragoon, Latios and Latias from Pokemon, Arwing and landmaster from Starfox, Koopa Clown car, famicom grand prix cars, and stay with me, Onion from Pikmin.\n\nMechanics: \nthere will be a race and a battle mode. In both modes, hitting players with items males them spin out, slow down, or knocks them around. Most items raise the percent of the targeted player, which makes them easier to knock around and off the track. \n\nIn race mode, there will be many tracks, all of which have little or no guardrails to make it possible to knock opponents off the track. Obviously, the goal in race mode it to get in 1st.\n\n In battles, there will be a timed mode, stock mode (with a set number of lives), and a battle royale-like mode called kart arena, where the last duo of players standing wins. All of these modes are playable on Mariokart-like battle stages and on the original tracks, which are called circuit battles.\n\nTracks:\nRainbow road (Mariokart), Big blue and Port town (F-Zero), Ray Surfing galaxy (Mario Galaxy), Lavender Town (Pokemon), Halberd (kirby), and... I ran out of ideas.\n\n\nThank you for hearing my ideas, and if you have any extra ideas of your own, please leave it in the comments as I would love to hear your ideas.\n"
b3vw0s,Game over quotes,Me and some friends are working on a beat em up sort of like bully but with a 16 year old female protagonist. We where thinking she should say something when she gets beat up and game over. What would be some good dialogue for that? Any ideas?
b3tmun,Idea for a low populace battle royale,"A ""low populace battle royale"" game sound a bit like an oxymoron: isn't battle royale genre about a huge number of players?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, kind of: the problem is, contrary to most multiplayer genre... the issue with Battle Royale is that you constantly need an huge number of players (sound beyond the number of player you need for a single match).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf any indie is going to try to make a BR.. they will mostly likely to fail, or, as did happen for PUBG Corp any random ""smart guy"" like Tim Sweeney with lot of money they have, they can buy you out of business (with brute force f2p model that few indie could afford anyway).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, what's the idea about this \*low populace battle royale\* anyway?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBasically, instead of a single character actor.. each player is give up to 10 android to control: they can control all of them but, here's the catch, only one at time. Plus, switching between your androids require some time: so you need to be very careful into pick which android you actually chose to scout around and the one you left ""idle"" at the mercy of other players.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt need just ten players to fill a map with 100 actors; yeah, only 1/10 of them are actually active players: but this number can be scaled up or down on the basis of the kind of gameplay (if you got 20 players, you can switch to 5 'droids per player and you're already 5/10... or if this get enough interest things can be fully scaled to 100 players (1000 android actors on a single map).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUnderstanding the mechanics (example for Basic strategy)\n\nYou need to hide your other 9 droids: quick and fast. Also you need to place them in a good strategy position. First instinct would tell you to scatter them around the map: would need a prototype for this game to see how things would actually work, but I \*\*suspect\* that the best strategy would to keep them closer: if someone attack/sacrifice one of your android in idle... you get to know the exact position of attacker: another android of yours can snipe him/her out before they run away with their loot. For the same reason, it may be risky to throw yourself into attack a idle android: it may be a trap.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\npossible feature to make this mechanics more incisive:\n\n1) normally you need to wait 5\~10 seconds to switch between androids... but when a android of yours is ""killed"" you can instantly switch to the closer one (no need to check the map) or select pick (you get  a special count down of 20 seconds to chose a androids in which immediately switch into).\n\n2) the first bullet/damage the androids take give its owner the chance to instant-switch inside that android. Other players that may want to attack your android need to be cautions and no haste attack, instead they need to plan accurately to ""in one single deadly attack""\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got few more idea about this project, willing to share if there's interest: if there's a team that want try to make a prototype of it, I am up to give top exclusivity for other features I had in mind (otherwise, I'll simply share those ideas with everyone: so Epic can just copy them into their own BR thing XP )\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTell me the things you things you think it wouldn't work: I'll try my best to extend the concept to meet those concerns\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs for concerns related to work-hours money  and other costs:  that's a factor you can't control by adding features/contents but by removing them. I'll do my best to scale down the idea."
b3tk76,Mario Party style mini-games without the board game part,"Game would be centered around quick bursts of fun mini-games similar to the type of stuff you'd see in a Mario Party or WarioWare game. In place of the board game progression, I envision a 4-person ""tournament"" of randomly selected games where in the first round it's 1v1v1v1, then the last place person gets booted out and 2nd round is 1v1v1, down to the final which would be a 1v1 for all the glory, with the whole thing only taking between 1-5ish minutes depending on how far you go."
b3nliq,Would like suggestions,"Looking to make another project, wondering about what it should be about. I like the style of Evolve or Friday the 13th style games. You have a Hunter and Prey roles. But I’m open to all suggestions and help\n"
b3myu0,A graphic reverse of hello neighbour,"1 -2 player game, where your home is broken into at night, the break in point is randomized as well as the amount of criminals too. \n\nSingle player obviously you live alone, multiplayer, possibly your partner works with you which increases the amount of criminals.\n\nYou'd have to use sound, clues, traps and whatever you can pick up to help either kill, knock out and detain the criminals. The NPC criminals aim is to steal randomized and targeted items each game. but if you're spotted before you deal with them, they become violent. \n\nI came up with the idea, because of the age old question of 'What would you do?'. In a similar scenario, would you pick up the kettle and doink someone on the head or coward in the closet and jump out with a guitar when they turn their back, or find humour in a game like this and set up ludicrous traps, like boobytrapping the door with clingfilm. I believe the sound and tracking element, like doors being opened or items being moved would make it seriously intense. \nI believe this could be quite a sinister stealth game, not much like hello neighbour, but its my best reference point. "
b3fint,Top-Down FTL-Inspired Ship Game,"2D, pixel/tile-based game that is similar to FTL, but instead of controlling all the ship members you control a single member on a crew of 10+ individuals.

b39buv,Racing Battle Royale,"I know sticking a battle royale at the end of every single genre is a meme at this point, but I honestly think this has potential to work after seeing that something like Tetris can be turned into a battle royale. Here is core ideas of a racing BR, if not a stand alone game it could be a side mode or even a mod.\n\n- Every time a new lap is started, the racer currently in last place will immediately be eliminated from the race.\n- Racers have a set amount of health, which a fraction of health can be sacrificed for a speed boost. \n- Boosting into other racers deals damage to the other racer; having no remaining health eliminates that racer from the race.\n- destroying other racers refilled your own health completely.\n- 30 to 50 racers on the track at a time.\n- The racetrack is considerably shorter than standard racing tracks; overlapping other racers should be common.\n- Race tracks have multiple paths, but the alternate paths will become blocked after so many laps.\n- The last remaining racer wins.\n\nThe health system is used as a risk/reward mechanic. Sacrificing your health to boost ahead puts you in less danger of getting eliminated by being in last place, but it makes you more vulnerable to getting destroyed by other racers boosting into you or crashing. Meanwhile boosting into other players can reward the player with more health, allowing them to boost ahead of their rivals or target more racers.\n\nRace tracks will feature shorter laps to constantly weed out racers. Additionally shorter laps creates a situation to where the lead racers are more likely overlapping the racers currently behind in the race. Overlapping is another risk/reward mechanic, since lead racers can gain even more ground by eliminating other racers, but they run the risk of being eliminated themselves. This keeps the game engaging both for racers near first place and last place.\n\n\nDon’t have any real plans to do anything with this idea, just something I’ve been pondering for a few weeks and wanted to put it to text. What do y’all think of a Racing BR?"
b386e0,mods/romhacks?,I feel like some of the ideas here (especially ones that use existing IPs) would make more sense as a mod than a standalone game.  Does this subreddit cover modding/hacking?
b37mqf,The Matrix,"Instead of remaking the Matrix as a movie, they should make it as a game. \n\nIf you choose to leave, you become Neo the kickass kungfu master. hand to hand combat coupled with 3rd person shooter. Have it where you can enter and exit the Matrix. Have this follow the three movies. You could potentially fix some issues that people have with characters/plot.\n\nIf you choose to stay in the matrix, yes the player is given a choice, the game becomes a HUGE dating sim for Mr. Anderson. You're stuck at an office job and you can try to date a huge pool of people, potentially. Have it where you can choose different jobs, maybe make Mr. Anderson become a farmer and have a farm simulator.  Perhaps you get with a dude? a chick? Perhaps you start a brothel and go all Yakuza 0?\n"
b35gqr,Hack and slash with portal mechanics,"Is there some game of this type? I was thinking of specifically a fast paced Dungeon crawler, not adventure or FPS like Portal.  \n\n\nThe idea was that you could open a portal on the floor of the dungeon and an underground world would show up within the portal, with the NPCs being able to climb up from the underground floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn the other hand, I was thinking that some enemies (or neutral NPCs) could be ""converted"" for them to start playing by your side, with the implications that has depending on personality of the NPC, meaning that it may play evil and betray you taking advantage he's part of your team, or he may not get along very well with another party member or whatever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust like that, though, it seems a bit stale or unoriginal, but I think the portal thing could have potential in a game like this.  \n\n\nWhat ideas come to your mind that could be cool additions/variations to it?"

b7l902,Game idea,"A story based game where wake up in a place where you found your self trapped there and there is a big gate requires key to open, you don't remember anything or how you came here, then you found a guy that tells you he is also trapped for long time and same as you cant remember why and how he ended up here. In order to escape this place you will have to enter 7(or any other number) dungeons and finish them to get 7 fragments to make a key to open gate to escape. This guy also tells you that you cant die every time you die you respawn in the starting place (if you die you lose all fragments and will have to redo all dungeons again). He also says  that there are other guys trying to finish dungeons which you will meet later ingame but non of them could collect all fragments. In the end the guy you met in the beginning turns out to be a demon who made this dungeons and doesn't want you to escape to make you die and die to collect your soul each time you die and sell them to other demons that feed on them. So you fight him along your team (people you meet in other dungeons) to escape.This game can be 2d style or 3d but I think 2d view would be better. Now the game must be hard and challenging. If you are interested in the idea I can make plot for you text and dialog."

Doing tricks and getting airtime restores air.\n\n**Micro movement:** You can expend roughly 5% of your maximum air to gain a small boost of speed. Drifting consumes air but can be done in ""micro drifts"" where you drift for a moment then right yourself to turn especially sharp corners and turn instantly. Micro drifting is encouraged and intended to be the primary method of turning your character. Drifting consumes air.\n\n**Why:** This design gives a feeling of player skill and intense action.

b6vvao,A forest ranger story driven game,"Hello all, I'm a begginer-intermediate indie game developer and I've come up with a story driven game I would like people's thoughts on. The idea is inspired by some stories I've been reading online about weird unexplainable (possible untrue) stories from park rangers and camp stories. So here goes.\n\nBACKSTORY\nThe main character (yet to be named so we'll call him Steve) is an ex cop who's become a forest ranger in search of a more peaceful lifestyle away from the city. Steve has a rough past and is overcoming the experience of having to fire a gun and kill a young teen during his time as a police officer (more to that story but it's not important to the main story and will be told through narrative). This leaves Steve with more appreciation of life and fear of harming others. So Steve finds himself chasing the less stressful job of a park ranger in a remote hiking and camping area.\n\nGAME STORY\nSteve begins his standard duties by meeting local campers... some mature campers, hiking enthusiasts and some unique characters who will later drive the storyline. Some of these campers wind up disappearing in a hurry, Steve has small run ins with a group of young campers just being steriotypical young people. Steves simple job begins to take a dark turn as he finds slaughtered animals and odd behaviours from this group of young people. Steve discovers this group is a cult of some sort acting out horrible rituals and ceremonies in the forest endangering campers and wildlife.\n\nI have yet to write the story in detail but that is the most part leading to the climax, from there I'm not sure wether to add a twist or how Steve would resolve the conflict (but I wouldn't want to spoil it anyway 😉)\n\nGAMEPLAY\nThe player will have a ""guided open world"" which is inbetween a  linear level progression and open world, so the player can traverse the landscape freely (not too big though nothing they can't travel across in a few minutes) but will only be able to travel through set paths to certain locations. The player will interact with the characters to learn their personalities and develop emotions in the player through events involving these NPCs. No survival or combat (except maybe story elements that would require it) just a good time for the player to explore, connect and learn. Maybe even some botany thrown in there to add some character development in terms of hobbies and maybe something extra to do throughout the game.\nI'm expecting about 3-4hrs of pure storyline gameplay with little activities for the player to do on the side. The part of the story with the cult will be slowly illuded too things seemingly having no connection then eventually allowing the player to connect the dots.\n\nSTYLE\nThe game will have an artistic/hand painted style as that's what I work best in with my level design and modelling, I also feel an artistic style will draw the player from connecting to the environment to connecting with the story and other characters within it. Also first person and point/click to interact with the environment.\n\nSo what are your thoughts on this? Would it be interesting if I pulled through? Would you okay this? Is there anything I need to add? Cheers in advance."

b6pib9,Race track designer,"I'm a huge race fan and always thought a sim builder game based around race track design would be fun. \n\nStart out with a humble plot of land and a dream to own a go-kart track. you design and expand your facility until you've build all the way up to an international grade racing facility. \n\nIn order to do so you would need to grow your track by signing track sponsor's and attracting racing series. \nPlace track sponsor signs around the track. \nGradually  improve your team and paddock facilities for both teams and fans. \nHire track marshal's and recovery teams. \nPlace marshal stations, sand traps, safety barriers escape roads, access roads for recovery crews. \nBuild media center, fan attractions, make the track easy or hard for fans to get  around by zoning area's off at different ticket prices... the choice is yours. \n\nYour track will be based off some key metrics \n\nSpeed\nTechnical rating \nSafety rating \nOvertaking chances \nTrack surface- abrasive/slippery/bumpy/smooth\n\nDifferent types of racing series require different metrics to consider putting your track on their season's calendar. \nA fast more dangerous circuit might not attract the  high end international racing series. But might be perfect for that slower national level touring car championship. \n\nThe game would be kind of a top down sim builder, with a terrain editor etc. \nBuilding/upgrading  the track wouldn't be as easy as using a bulldozer icon.. \nYou would need to submit blue prints and schedule the upgrade or build time in your yearly calendar making sure it doesn't clash with a race series. \nChoose different build contractors each their own drawbacks and benefits eg. \nCheap but fast contractor company may mean the track surface needs more regular maintenance. \nDifferent contractors use different asphalt changing the metric of the track surface also. \n\nI think a game along this line would be fun... \n\nObviously very niche though. \n\nThoughts/ideas to add? \n"

b6lz1v,My take on a survival game.,"I’m new here so I don’t necessarily know which flair additions mean what; but, there has been an idea I’ve been wanting to put into words. \nI’m not sure if there is anything 100% like this or if there is, so I’m sorry if this has been posted before or already exists. As well, this will be a lengthy post, sorry in advance!\n\nSo, as the title suggests, it’s a survival game but at the same time it’s a bit more than that.\n\nThe “setting” is a not too distant dystopian future but with an almost “Utopian” style. Buildings are decrepit and crumbling, everything is broken down and succumbing to nature...but that’s the “Utopian” style. Is that even though the cityscape is falling apart; the vines, trees, wild grass, and all other types of flora are making what would be a desolate and gloomy scene something that crushes and lifts your spirits at the same time.\n\nThe “play area” is decently large. Multiple cities, small towns, a good chunk of rural and forested area.\nCities and Towns being where you scavenge for supplies(weapons, food, building materials, etc.) and potentially create a living situation.\nRural areas being farms and such.\nForested areas are more for your hunting side of things, with the option to make a cabin you found your living quarters.\n\nThe “enemies” are a bit different.\nYour most dangerous enemy is one you can’t escape from:\n-The elements and your body. \nI’d refuse to implement an extremely complex nutrition system like Scum, but something more than your base “Hunger and Thirst” meters. You can survive on just eating and drinking, but you get certain boosts or benefits from trying to eat a more balanced diet.\nAnd on the elements side of things, hypothermia from staying out in cold too long, frostbite from not having enough layers when it’s winter, heatstroke from over exertion during the summer.\n-Enemy two is fauna. Bears, Wolves, Mountain Lions, etc. Pretty self explanatory.\n-Enemy three is other humans. NPC raiders, slave traders, anyone. But not all NPC’s are bad. There’s survivor outposts and camps, you can join one or start your own and convince others to join and settle down at you camp or to just establish good standing and trade opportunities. \n\nYour character design:\nCharacter design is a semi-complex one. You have positives and negatives based on your stature and age.\nAges: There is no “Age” selection. There is an “Age group” rather: Child, Teen, Young Adult, Adult, Middle Aged and Elder.\nChild is about 9-12, Teen is about 13-16, Young Adult is 17-25, Adult is 26-40, Middle Aged is 41-55, Elder is 56-70.\nAging is a thing, X amount of time in game ages you up slowly until you reach the next age group and then the timer restarts for your next age cycle.\n\nYour age selection determines certain qualities about your character and provides certain opportunities and certain downsides.\nFor example - Child: Pros: You’re smaller so you can hide easier, get into smaller locations, survive on eating smaller portions than normal, increased stamina, Longer life span if you can survive, longer life means more options to increase and unlock skills. Cons: You’re more feeble than any other age range, your more prone to health issues, you have less cold resistance, you can’t carry as much, you need more sleep, you need to consume more water.\n\nAs for the characters stature, there is a “preset” and a triangle slider.\nPresets are: Average, Well built, Hefty, and Lanky.\nBody statures have pros and cons.\nExample: Well built: You’re stronger than most, you can carry more, your stamina is better. But you have to consume a very well balanced diet, you have to work out to maintain your stature, and you have to consume more water.\nBody statures can only be selected when “Young Adult” is reached. Child and teen are set as “Average” and cannot change it.\nYou can change your stature during your game by eating certain ways and Maintaining a certain level of exercise.\n\nCharacter traits are dispersed initially through a Personality selector.\nSome ideas are Humble, Self-centered, Aggressive, Domineering, Polite, Friendly(can be a handful or quite extensive).\nEach personality has a dispersion of “Character traits”, those consist of:\nIntelligence, Charisma, and Bartering.\nYour profession determines your other Character traits.\n\nProfessions are: Unemployed, Police, Construction, Medical, Armed Forces, and Student.\nThese effect the Character traits of:\nStrength, Agility, Crafting, Medical, and Weaponry.\n—Children and Teens cannot select any profession besides Student.\n\nSkills and Character Traits(CT):\nSkills and CT’s go hand in hand. Having high CT’s boost the exp gain for skills under that CT.\nSkills are improved by using your exp to unlock the next level of a specific one.\nIf you picked “Construction” as your profession, you’re crafting CT is naturally better than most which means you have access to more crafting skills off the bat.\nSkills are not a “Spend EXP here to unlock X weapon/blueprint”, but rather increase the effectiveness of your repairs, durability of what you craft, damage of what you craft, and the success rate of your crafting attempts, as well as the amount of things you get back if the crafting attempt fails.\n\nCrafted Weapons are unlocked by experimenting with your materials.\nOf you find barbed wire or nails while exploring and you have a bat at home. Go to your base, grab the bat, go to the crafting table and put your nails and bat together and you may get a “Spiked Baseball Bat” in return.\n\nOther CT’s have the success rate buff, but each one has buffs for what each CT entails.\n\nLoot:\nThe loot consists of guns, bows, food(canned and seeds), crafting materials(wood, plastic, cloth, metal, nails, etc), tools(hammers, wrenches, saws, etc), water bottles/jugs, clothing items, pretty much anything naturally occurring in real life.\n\nVehicles can be looted and taken apart to repair/rebuild others, but fuel and gas are hard to come by...but you may manufacture homemade fuel.\n\nYou can find stray dogs and attempt to “Bond” with them.\nOffer food &gt; if the dog accepts &gt; Pet.\nOffer food &gt; if the dog rejects &gt; He runs away.\n\nIt’s a series of bonding attempts before they become loyal to you.\nYou can do the same with Wolves, but that is much harder and very very dangerous.\n\n\nOther game mechanics:\n—Growing your own food\n—Fishing\n—Trapping/Hunting\n—Trading\n—Animal breeding(cows, pigs, other farm animals)\n—Harvesting resources(Trees, plants, etc.) No punching trees...have to find an axe first.\n—Base fortification, prebuilt defenses. No free form building. Maybe prebuilt strictures like cabins, huts, tents and such if you decide to start a survivor camp.\n—Political standing. Used when trying to convince other camps to join yours.\n\nI know that’s a lot, but it is something that some games have bits and pieces of, but nothing has fully enveloped everything(at least to my knowledge).\n\nSorry for the length, I tried to get the basics down but there is a lot more I have in my head. I just didn’t want it to sound ridiculous.\n\nIf I get any feedback, that’s appreciated. If not, I hope you guys enjoyed reading it xD."
b6dztn,Looking for simple puzzle game ideas,"Hey all.  I've been lurking on this subreddit for a while and figured it was time to finally ask for an idea.  I've built a small ""game"" (if it can even be called that at this point) with doors and text overlays, but haven't been able to figure out what to do with it next.  At first I thought something along the lines of giving vague visual or text prompts and having the player solve a puzzle, but I realized that the number of puzzles that could be created is a little limited.\n\nI know that beggars can't be choosers, but here's a list of things I'm looking for in ideas:\n\n\- Focused around the doors (kind of obvious)\n\n\- Puzzles of some kind.  What the puzzles are doesn't really matter too much as long as it's not super complex\n\n\- Preferably for mobile platforms\n\n\- Works well with limited colors\n\n\- Possibly(?) have a kind of simple, creepy plot but still focusing on the gameplay (think SUPERHOT)\n\nI would upload a gif of what I've got so far, but I don't seem to be able to include one, so here's a link to a short video of it.\n\n[https://youtu.be/jY18kHzvFCc](https://youtu.be/jY18kHzvFCc)"
b6dct4,Card game idea about parallel timelines,"In this game, players create alternate universe timelines, and compete to see whose take is best. To start the game, a Chronomaster for the first round is chosen. The Chronomaster decides the fate of time, and acts as a judge for that round. \n\nA divergence in the timeline is then taken art random from the timeline pile (for example, in 1936, England bans shoes). Players then choose from a deck of cards, each with a possible eventuality of the timeline change (Ghandi wins world war 3). They choose a card, and explain how their eventuality makes the most sense (Without shoes, allies suffer major casualties. India, becomes an independent militarized state, lead by the disillusioned Ghandi. Eventually, India rebels against the dominant Axis powers, triggering WWIII. Due to grand strategic planning, Germany is defeated, and Ghandi wins). The Chronomaster chooses which time line works best, and awards the winner with one point. The next round, the winner becomes the Chronomaster.\n\n The alternate universe continues for 3 rounds, each time expanding on the previous round's history (someone might try to describe how Ghandi's victory in WWIII might result in the extinction of the giraffe). Whoever wins the most rounds wins the game.\n\nIf anyone has any suggestions for making the game run better, or just card ideas, I'd be interested to hear them."
b6d353,Dual world-dual gameplay,"So here's an idea I've been toying around with as a central mechanic. Having a game with a fully realized system for both over the shoulder gunplay and melee parry and counter sword fighting, but switching between the two changes more than what weapon the character is currently holding.\n\nThink of it this way, you know how in recent years some developers have a kind of oddly split franchise tree, one sci-fi the other fantasy. Blizzard has Warcraft and Starcraft, Games Workshop has Warhammer and Warhammer 40K, Bioware has Dragon Age and Mass Effect, etc. In this game, you're playing as the protagonist of both these settings in one person, swapping back and forth between the worlds freely.\n\nWhen you're playing as ""Lance"" your enemies will be orc equivalents armed with axes and hammers but as soon as you swap to ""Bolt"" they turn into aliens armed with plasma weapons and grenades with the environment changing to match. Beyond having the option, the swap would also serve the function that some method of progress isn't available in one world but is in the other. \n\nFor instance a locked door with no key for Lance is a door that can just be brute forced hacked by Bolt. More to the point though, both sides can be leveled up. Lance learning more fighting moves and gaining more powerful magic and Bolt getting better weapons and tech upgrades, subtly challenging the player to either try and strike a balance or favor one at the expense of the other.\n\nThere's also a lot of narrative implications for the swap system. But you can skip this section if you think that's less important than I do. For instance, other characters besides the hero(es) could be aware of or even be able to swap themselves. Perhaps including the main villain. If you put more focus on either Lance or Bolt, maybe one world turns out worse than its counterpart. Or just symbolically. If you save both worlds relying more on Lance, maybe that says you favor the tried and true ways whereas saving the world with Bolt means you think forward thinking is the path to salvation. **Story section over.**\n\nThis is just me throwing out an idea I thought would be cool. What do you guys think?"

If you can think of a game that exists similar to what we are trying to create, please do comment it below and we can discuss what that game does and doesn't do well.\n\nThis game has been inspired by 2 different games, and attempts to merge them into 1:\n\n[Banished](https://store.steampowered.com/app/242920/Banished/), a settlement builder that focuses on strict survival, growth, strict resource management and macro job allocation.\n\n[Catan](https://www.catan.com/), the classic strategy hex board game loved by many.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wanted to spark some discussion around the concept of our new game to flesh out if it could be interesting or not and how a concept like this might play.  Forums, and Reddit in particular, are incredibly powerful and I would like to try and merge the discussion and feedback early into the decision making and development of the game.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would like to present this as simply and easy to read as i can, so i will break this down into the games core features as headings below.  There is also plenty of information about the game on our website [here](https://www.cavernlightstudios.com/).  I at least hope that any images or videos there help you visualise what a game like this will look like.\n\n1. The gameplay is similar to a city building game.  The game will play very much like Banished, where the goals of the players are to both survive in the environment and grow your empire.  On the surface this may seem easy, however, the most common mistake people will make when playing a city builder, is to try to exponentially grow your populace without any infrastructure to support it such as food, housing, etc.\n2. There is no combat.  There is only economic and political conflicts.\n\nThis concept really stems from Catan, which is why it can be a little difficult to conceptualize as a RTS style PC game.  To win the game, you must:\n\n1. Survive (not lose).\n2. Grow quicker than opponents to claim a list of achievements.  Each achievement is worth a different number of victory points, first player to a certain number of points win.  \n\- Some achievements will be race like, and will only grant points to the first player to reach the achievements goal.  \n\- Other achievements will only be granting points to the player that is dominating in a category, similar to the longest road in Catan.  \n\- Other achievements can be claimed by any players once they reach a certain milestone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat is a high level breakdown of Built in a day, how to play the game and a brief description of how to win.\n\nIf you would like more information before commenting on the game, or would like some sort of visual aid as to what the game will look like, check out our website [here](https://www.cavernlightstudios.com/) and our latest devlog [here](https://youtu.be/EFLF2wwqHYU).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI look forward to the discussion here, and thank you all for the comments in advance.  I will be checking in on this post frequently and replying where I can.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCheers,\n\nCavernlight Studios."
b6adjn,"My ideas for games I had in mind, ideas for my games.","One a game with a zombie apocalypse happening with other monsters around too. But instead of playing regular human, you play as a werewolf fighting zombies and such. I would have fun coding this game, what do ya'll think?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA graphic novel stele game which you press buttons for the next event to happen.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA western zombie game, set in the apocalypse but with cowboys and gunslingers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA game where you can turn into different animals, determine your choices, e.i like a dog you can do certain things like sniff and search and hide but you got to beware of humans like pet control, but you can get away by turning into a bird but some areas you got to be aware from hunters..\n\nAnd humans would be your enemies since they are after you sometimes but you want to keep it  a secret you can morph into animals so you change to an animal according to your setting, if you get caught it will change the story. You have to now adapt to different skills and humans now your enemy are looking for you because of your shapeshifting abilities discovered. That includes police military and government.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would probably pick the last ice to work on first for my first time project making a game, I'm just getting into basic stuff right now my friends are great programers and they will be getting into big projects someday and can help me but I want to know what you guys thing of my ideas for which seems like the coolest project, thanks!"
b694ql,Racion: a big idea in my head,"Alright alright, first of all, this will be a long post but I think it is worth it to read, because a lot of effort went in this and I want to share some things and have your opinions about other things.  \n\n\nGeneral idea &amp; intention: \n\nFantasy world like the one of League Of Legends but the game is more based on the lore, world and stories. Now, if I ever want to turn this in a game, I couldn't, because I don't have the rights to Riot's world. So I decided to think one of my own. I really want to keep the feel that every ""empire"" has their own beliefs, culture and strategies. I took some inspiration from World Of Warcraft and the following is the product of month long thinking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRaces:\n\nI would like to introduce the 4 obvious races that every fantasy themed world has: Humans, Elves, Gnomes and Dwarves. Later I could expand this with 4 more races: Giants, Guardians, Orcs and Undead.  \nLike I said, every race would have his culture and strategies, for example: undead are with many and have only a few people in their 'faction' that are respected and have authority and Elves would be equal to eachother.  \nThe relation between the races would be determined by the players.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nClasses:\n\nLike most fantasy worlds, I also have classes. However, I am not sure how I would do them. My first Idea is 3 classes with each of them having 3 subclasses making a total of 9 classes.  \nYou can have a better idea if you look at [this](https://imgur.com/a/fBwl0ws) screenshot.\n\nMy 2nd idea is a class system that is locked with the race you selected. So here I went big and made 3 classes for every race making a total of 24 classes.  \nYou can have a better idea if you look at [this](https://imgur.com/Si5FizT) screenshot.\n\nComment what you think is the best and tell me why.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPolitical ideology:\n\nI think it would be awesome that every race not only has a culture but also has a political system. Nothing big, just who or what makes decisions for the 'faction'?  \nThe ideologies that I think are interesting enough and viable enough are the following:  \nAnarchism, Communism, Liberalism, Nationalism, Socialism and Republic state.  \nNow if we count those, that are 6 ideologies and I have 8 races. It would be awesome if I had 2 ideologies more that are different enough that they aren't like a copy of 1 of the others.\n\nWhat are your thoughts and suggestions?  \n\n\nPS: Not that long that I thought, might forgot some things.... Feel free to ask if there are things that aren't clear."
b67aya,An 2d adventure rpg that requires 2-4 local multiplayers to play (For example in turns combat system every player have to choose an atack to perform for their specific character),
b64jxj,"my dream rpg part 1 , i want this to be a trilogy"," \n\nhello this my idea for a game , i will first say about the things you can do in the game and after i will say about the story , sorry if i write bad im not good with english :(\n\nFEATURES :\n\n\- the games is open world , medieval fantasy setting , there will be dungeons that give alot of gold , magical secrets\n\n\- you can enter every building , do all the basic stuff like fishing , swimming , eating , drinking , playing mini games or fighting for money at inns , you can have relationships , you can have party if u want\n\n\- you can talk to all the npcs help them in any way from small stuff like carrying heavy things for them to more important things like kill bandits that try steal from them or corrupt guards that take resources from them for protection . You can also be the bad guy that takes resources from them , you can also act like a hitman and kill npcs for money ( you can even kill the king of a kingdom) . This doesnt affect leveling , it affects the way people see you , talk about you . And it will later affect how many allies you have\n\n\- there are classes , first 2 basic ones either magic or physical , you chose this at the character creation ( its how you are born) , after as you progress and lv up you can choose more complex classes with more complex skills . If you chose physical at birth you will go to a schools to teach physical combat and after lv 10 you will chose new class and if u want to join a guild that fights for the kingdom , a group of mercenaries that fights for themselves or whoever gives them money , or you can just be by yourself . If you choose magical at birth you can join at lv 10 a magic guild or be alone . Guilds will offer some exclusive skills but you can learn either by tallking to a corupt guild memeber ( give him money and he will give you books ) or you can enter the guild fortress sneaking/force and read theyr books\n\n\- the game will be 3rd person( maybe 1st person too) , there will be climbing , combat similar to kingdom of amalur\n\n\-you can own land/house , start your own kingdom but you need alot of allies or you can just make ur kingdom by force ( kill the king and his generals and take his place on the throne ) . the kingdom you live in has 3 districs every district with its general , 1st district is where the richest people live , 2nd is where normal people live and 3rd is where poor live\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSTORY\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo the game starts with a cinematic of the council and generals of the kingdom-district1 ( the one where the king is ) , and the king is very late for the morning meeting , your father is sent to see if he is ok . You will play here with the father When he enters the kings room he sees the king lying on the ground and some masked man searching his room for something , a fight starts and your father kills the masked man . The king is barely breathing he gives your father a ring and tells him to trust no one . After the kings death the general of the 1st district takes his place by the votes of the council .\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou still play as the father and you go to the kingdom's library ( the library is huge and very beautiful one of the most beautiful places in the kingdom ) to look for the symbol that the ring has , your father is being watched by a misterious person . He finds the symbol , its mentioned in a old spell that was once used to drain all the magic from a person .\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nwhen he gets home he finds you and ur mother surrounded by a group of masked men , they tell him to give them the ring or they will kill you and ur mother . He gives them the ring and they stab your mother , gameplay starts , you fight against 4 enemies and when you are at a disadvantage the misterious person from the library (\*\*Leofrick)\*\*comes to ur aid , he manages to save you but ur father dies . He takes you and the ring and leaves in a small village in the forest\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou do all kinds of deeds in the village , you learn magic or physical abilities from **Leofrick** . You reach lv 10 and and u are an adult , you want to go to visit the kingdom but **Leofrick** tells you that you are not allowed because they are too many dangers out of the village but one day you go anyway . You take some of **Leofrick** 's stuff food water some clothes and some spell scrolls that were hidden under his house . When you camp and look at the scrolls you notice the ring and decide to wear it .\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou reach kingdom gates and when you try to enter the kingdom 2 guards notice the ring and they stop you ,they say they havent seen you before and you tell them that you want to find the guild house . They tell you that they will escort you there , they lead you to a dead end zone and try to kill you but **Leofrick** saves you . You ask why did they do that and**Leofrick** tells you the whole story\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUp until here there was not alot of freedom in the game , but from this point you can go where u want and do whatever you want .\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Leofrick** tells you that he doesnt know who exactly wants the ring and why but he suspects that its the kings council , the council always hated the magical users because they were a threat to the non magical people . You are determined to find out and sneak into the library , you find the same book your father found but you also find a map withing the cover of the book with a location that has the symbol from the ring . **Leofrick** said that he has a friend that can decipher the map ( **Ranald** ) he is a member of the council form the 2nd district . Even though **Ranald** is a memeber of the council **Leofrick**says that he trust him completly .\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn ur way to the destination you will find alot of beautiful locations , dungeons . You reach a mountain , that is where your destination is , on top of the mountain there is a pillar that can be opened with the ring guarded by a monster and there is a scroll there that is used to learn a spell that drains all magic from a person permanently . **Ranald stabs Leofrick**in the back and hits you with a magic projectile that send you off the mountain . Ranald gives the scroll to a misterious person . You survive and the game ends with a cinematic of you entering a new kingdom\n\ni know its long but sorry , and sorry for my english again :( and if u can tell if it is any good"

General description\n\n\-  Game type : FPS \n\n\-  Mode : multi-player\n\n\-  Environment : survival horror\n\n\-  Style : battle royale, arcade \n\n\-  Platform : PC (consoles ?)\n\n\-  Engine : UE4 ? Unity ?\n\n\-  Number of players : 8 minimum, as many as possible ideally (32 ? 64 ? more ?)\n\n\- PEGI : 18 \n\n# 2. Synopsis\n\nThe player incarnates a survivor into a post-apocalyptic world who must defend himself against other survivors and against zombie hordes controlled by artificial intelligence but also controlled by other players. \n\nThe survivors must buy weapons and other accessories with virtual money (Z-coins) in order to defend themselves against zombies and enemy survivors.\n\nThe players infected by zombie bites eventually turn into zombies themselves and join the zombie team. They still can try to win the game this time by infecting all remaining survivors. \n\n# 3. Game modes, goals and rules\n\n#  3.1 Deathmatch\n\n\-  **Warm up :**\n\no One player creates a game, defines an entering price in Z-coins for the pre-game bet (detailled in a further chapter) and invites other players to join.\n\no The game starts when the number of players needed is reached.\n\no The players buy their initial weapons and gear just before the game starts.\n\n\- **Beginning of the game :**\n\no  The survivors are randomly disposed onto their respawn area located on the edges of the map.\n\no  A first zombie controlled by artificial intelligence (AI-zombie) spawns at the same time at the center of the map and will immediately move towards the closest survivor to attack him. \n\no  A zombie bite removes a certain amount of health and one single bite leads to an irreversible contamination. Once infected, the survivor will then progressively and inevitably lose all of his health until he dies and then turn into a zombie-player.\n\no Every AI-zombie eliminated by a survivor will leave a Z-coin on his body which any survivor can pick up. A zombie-player eliminated will leave 100 Z-coins on his body.\n\n\- **Following :**\n\no  Every AI-zombie eliminated will then immediately give birth to two other new AI-zombies in the zombie respawn area located between the edges and the center of the map. The number of AI-zombies will then constantelly grow as survivors eliminate more AI-zombies and so on. \n\no  The survivors can also eliminate other survivor players in order to steal their gear and the Z-coins they have collected during the game.\n\no  Once eliminated, the survivor loses all of his weapons and gear but also all the Z-coins in his possession. He can then buy new weapons and gear from his Z-coin account before respawning again on the edges of the map. He can die and respawn as a survivor on and on as long as he has not been infected.\n\no  Once infected, the survivor who eventually dies no mather how will than rescurrect as a zombie-player.\n\no  The zombie-player must try to infect all the reamaining survivors if he wants to win the game as part of the zombie team.\n\no  Every time a zombie-player is eliminated, he respawns in the zombie respawning zone between the edges and the center of the map. \n\no  Every time a new infected survivor joins the zombie team, all the previous zombie-players get 100 Z-coins. If they manage to win the game in the end, they will then keep the whole amount as a reward.\n\no  The number of AI-zombies keep growing on and on as long as half of the survivors hasn’t been infected and turned into zombies.\n\n\- **End of the game :**\n\no  Once half of the survivors have been turned into zombies, every AI-zombie eliminated no longer respawns. The zombie-players on the other hand will keep on respawning as long as there are AI-zombies remaining on the map. \n\no  Once that all the AI-zombies have been eliminated, every zombie-player eliminated no longer respawns either.\n\no  The survivors win if they manage to eliminate all the AI-zombies, all the zombie-players and all the infected survivors from the map (an infected survivor is considered part of the zombie team).\n\no  The zombies win if they manage to infect and turn all the survivors into zombies.\n\no  If the survivors win, each player keeps the Z-coins collected in his possession plus his share of the total pre-game bet from the beginning which is divided by the number of remaining survivors.\n\no If the zombies win, each zombie-player keeps his Z-coins collected as a zombie and take back his pre-game bet from the beginning. \n\n# 3.2. Escape\n\nIn the Escape mode, the survivors must try to evacuate the map through an helicopter which of course does not have enough room for everyone. The Escape mode begins exactly the same way as Deathmatch excepted that once half of the survivors have turned into zombies, the AI-zombies and the zombie-players keep respawning after being eliminated but AI-zombies no longer grow in numbers. At the same time, the helicopter arrives over the top of a random building on the map. The remaining half of the survivors must now reach the helicopter to win the game. The problem is that the helicopter has only enough room for half of the remaining survivors (only one quarter of the total number of survivors who started the game). \n\nThe game ends when the helicopter leaves either because it is filled with the maximum number of survivors or because there are no more survivors alive left to rescue. An infected survivor is unable to enter the helicopter and is considered part of the zombie team even before he turns. The survivors who managed to reach the helicopter keep their Z-coins collected during the game and equally share the whole pre-game bet as a reward. \n\nThe zombie-players win the game and have their pre-game bet part back if they manage to infect all survivors before anyone of them reaches the helicopter. If they lose, however, they are still able to keep the Z-coins collected during the game as zombies in order to prevent the zombie players from quitting the game before the end. \n\n# 4. Real money and virtual money\n\nThe virtual money (Z-coins) is needed in order to buy weapons and accessories during the game. Every player owns an account where he can deposit or whithdraw his virtual money. During the game, the survivors can buy some new gear before respawning but not while playing. Survivors cannot deposit money on their account while playing either. \n\nThe virtual money can be gained through different ways :\n\n\- « Buying » virtual money with real money. \n\nThe number of Z-coins gained by paying with real money is equal to the amount spent in euros cubed.\n\nFor example : $1 = 1x1x1 = 1 Z-coin. $10 = 10x10X10 = 1000 Z-coins. $100 = 100x100x100 = 1 000 000 Z-coins and so on.\n\n\- Collecting Z-coins in game :\n\no  The survivors can pick up Z-coins left by zombies on their dead bodies once they are killed. \n\nA dead AI-zombie will leave 1 Z-coin on his body and a dead zombie-player will leave 100 Z-coins on its body. \n\nHowever, when a survivor gets killed by another survivor or if he turns into a zombie he will lose all the Z-coins he previously collected as well as the gear he had bought and/or collected until then, leaving it all available to be stealed by other players. \n\no  The zombie-players already part of the zombie team will gain 100 Z-coins every time a new zombie-player joins the zombie team. Meaning that for example on a 100 players game won by the zombie team, the first player to turn into a zombie will gain 10.000 Z-coins and the last player to be transformed will gain 100 Z-coins. \n\n\-  Betting Z-coins pre-game :\n\no The player who creates the games freely determines an entering price in Z-coin that every player must pay to be allowed to join, including himself. The total amount of virtual money will constitute the pre-game bet.\n\no If survivors win, they equally share the total amount of pre-game bet divided by the number of remaining survivors. If zombies win, each of them takes his personnal initial bet back (corresponding to the game entering price).\n\n# 5. The maps\n\nGeneral design :\n\n\-  A central devastated urbanised zone where survivors can better protect themselves inside the ruins. \n\n\-  A wild zone made of forests or swamps around the central zone which will also be the the respawn area for all zombies, players and AI. \n\n\- The edges of the map will be delimited by freeways and abandonned cars corresponding to the survivors’ respawn area. \n\nThe freedom of travelling through the entire map can be improved by creating a torus/donut shaped world whith no invisible walls. The players will then be able to directly cross the edges of the map from one side to the opposite without interruption or obstacles. \n\n# 6. The characters\n\n\- **Survivors :**\n\nThe survivors are human characters controlled by players. Their goal is to end the game alive without being infected while collecting as much money as they can at the same time. \n\nThe survivors have some physical skills determined by their remaining amount of health :\n\n\-  Between 75 and 100 points of health :\n\no Automatic health regeneration of 1 point per minute up to 100\n\no Ability to sprint during 20 seconds and make long jumps\n\no Ability to run at moderate speed without limit of time\n\no Ability to use aim down sight with heavy weapons\n\no Ability to hold a medium firearm in each arm for hip aim\n\n\-  Between 50 and 75 points of health :\n\no No more automatic health regeneration\n\no No more possibility to sprint but still possible to run at moderate speed for 20 seconds, walk at normal speed and make short jumps. \n\no Aim down sight can no longer be used for heavy weapons which can still be hip fired.   \n\no No more possibility to hold a medium weapon in both hands but still work with two handguns.\n\n\- Between 25 and 50 points of health :\n\no Still able to walk at normal speed for 20 seconds and walk slowly with a limp the rest of the time\n\no Can no longer use a heavy weapon by any means\n\no Can no longer aim down sight with a medium weapon which can still be hip fired\n\no Still able to aim down sight with a handgun\n\no Can no longer use a handgun in both hands\n\n\-  Between 0 and 25 points of health :\n\no Health automatically decreases by 1 point every minute until death\n\no Walking is no longer possible, crawling becomes the only way to move\n\no No possibility to use a heavy or medium weapon by any means\n\no Hip fire with a handgun is still possible\n\nA survivor begins with 100 points of health every time he respawns and he will lose more points of health when he gets hit in the weaker parts of his body. \n\n\-  Damage potential by body parts :\n\no Head : 100%\n\no Chest : 66%\n\no Abdomen : 33%\n\no Thigh : 25%\n\no Legs and arms : 10%\n\nSurvivors lose 1 point of health every minute until they die once they are infected.\n\n\- **AI-zombies :**\n\nAI-zombies are controlled by artificial intellingence. They are automatically aimed to attack the closest survivor to them on the map as soon as they respawn. \n\nThey have exactly the same amount of health and the same damage potential by body parts than survivors. They move at survivors’ moderate running speed.\n\nA zombie-AI bite will remove 10 points of health from a survivor’s health and will infect him irreversibly. The infected survivor will then progressively lose all his health until he dies before turning into a zombie. \n\n\- **Zombie-players :**\n\nThe zombie-players are controlled by a player who was a survivor before dying previously infected by a zombie bite.\n\nZombie-players have a superior amount of health of 200 points but the same damage potential by body parts.\n\nThey are able to climb on walls and ceilings.\n\nThey can sprint permanantly without need to rest.\n\nTheir health progressively regenerates up to 200 as long as it has not fallen to zero.\n\nOn the other hand, they have 15 minutes to attack a survivor before their health starts to decline until they die.\n\nZombie-players have a natural radar to track survivors and a special vision to see them through walls.\n\nA zombie-player bite costs 20 points of health to a survivor and infects him irreversibly, making him lose 2 points of health every minute until he dies.\n\n# 7.

Conclusion\n\nThe beginning of a game is pretty similar to a regular multiplayer deathmatch where players will confront each other in a guerilla atmosphere between sniper duels and bloody ambushes. The winners of those first combats will earn the privilege to loot their opponents’ equipment in order to constitute a precious stock to help them face the following events. \n\nMeanwhile, the first zombie controlled by AI will start to attack the survivors before being joined by the rest of the growing horde as one zombie killed will instantly give birth to two new other zombies. \n\nSurvivors will further tend to retreat inside the ruins of the central zone, progressively switching to weapons more efficient in close combat, especially when ammo will start to run dry. \n\nTension will then rise in intensity to reach its climax when half of the survivors will be turned into zombies and it won’t fall until the remaining survivors eliminate definitely all the zombies on the map... If they ever succeed to do so.\n\nThe gaming experience also gets a lot more interesting when it comes to deal with conflictual interests. While playing survivor, getting your opponents infected as soon as possible will minimise the number of AI-zombies to eliminate at the end of the game and thus increasing your chances to win. On the other hand, sparing other players and teaming up with them insures a better protection against hostile groups rather than remaining isolated. \n\nTurns out that joining the zombie team at an early stage also leads to more gains in case of a zombie win. However, switching to the zombie team too quickly will make victory more difficult as the AI-zombie horde wil be less numerous and easier for survivors to take down.\n\nIn other words, the longer survivors will resist before half of them turn into zombies, the harder it will be for them to keep on resisting afterwards in order to win the game.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading"
b5ujbb,Looking for Group -- GMOffensive by Elheber,"I am trying to make this game a reality because I personally believe it is a great idea, but I do not have the resources to make this. If anyone wants to work on this project with me, I will be using Unity2D engine to make it. Artist is a high priority because I do not know how to make sprites.\n\n\nCredit goes to u/elheber\n""GMOffensive""\nYou're a new farmer in a slice of life town. Your crops keep getting raided by wild animals and monsters; even your cows are being abducted by aliens. You've had enough. So, as an ex-mad scientist, you start splicing DNA into your corn and cabbage to have claws and fangs. You give your tomatoes and potatoes whips and venom. You turn your cows into kung-fu cows.\n\nEvery morning you get up to water your crops, milk your cows, harvest ripe crops, plant new seeds, and prepare them for the nightly battles. The first half of the day plays like a slice of life farming game (Harvest Moon, Stardew Valley) including the interactions with the town's NPCs, while the last portion plays like a tower defense game (Plants vs. Zombies) and is the secret you keep from the townspeople. During the latter portion, you'll run around in your fields supporting your crops and fighting enemies with your own farming tools and weapons.\n\nNow you aren't just organizing your crop placement for efficiency, but also for maximum defense. Do you plant in rows easier to water, or a maze more difficult for enemies to pass? Do you choose which plants to sow for their profitability or their defensive capabilities?\n\nEach crop (and animal) has traits that they can pass down to their offspring. Poison damage? Shooting projectiles? Higher damage/defense? All those are traits that can be randomly inherited. Instead of selling your best crops, you can also choose to use them to seed the next generation to continually upgrade them. You don't even need to breed from the same species... you're a mad scientist! You can crossbreed the fire breathing attack from your pigs to give to your turnips. Just be sure to water the surrounding crops.\n\nThe game is half farming &amp; breeding lab, and half action tower defense."
b5s2t5,An idea I just had yesterday about a war simulator where you control the country,"It would be pretty simple; you'd have a view of a map and could declare war on any country you want (regardless of actual alliances IRL) and send a limited troops, tanks, airplanes, nukes (of course, nukes should be a last resort), whatever etc based on real statistics, causing them to retaliate (basically an FPS, except you're not a soldier). Of course, the goal would be to just win against that country, unless other countries started attacking you as part of an alliance, in which case you'd have to either surrender or win against all of them.\n\nMaybe in easy mode, you'd control a very powerful country (US, Russia, idk) and could choose who to attack and no other countries would attack you in return.\n\nIn medium difficulty, you'd control a slightly less powerful country and had to choose between slightly more difficult opponents and other countries would retaliate, but not enough to make you weep in a corner.\n\nIn hard mode, you would control an even less powerful country and would have to take down superpowers, and other countries would retaliate as they would IRL.\n\nAnd I thought maybe there could be a sandbox mode where you choose who you are, who to attack and you also have an unlimited number of everything. Including nukes. Maybe it'd be unlocked by winning a few rounds on hard mode? I don't know.\n\nHell, I feel like *I* could make the game myself but I have no idea what engine to use. So if anyone wants to make it, go ahead. If anyone has a good idea of an engine I could use to make it, also go ahead. I can learn new programming languages relatively fast."
b5ru2b,2D sidescroller platform where you obtain different items you will need to complete the level.,"The idea is that there are different levels on the map you can pick to complete - you can pick to complete them in any order you like. \n\nEach level (after completion of sub levels - thinks 1.a., 1.b., 1.c.) will get you the item (clothing, accessory, etc). Each item gives the hero different abilities that mirror some pop culture and other famous references - laser sword, wall crawling, super jump, teleport.\n\nThe catch is that every level requires at least 1 of these items to complete it, but it can be any of them. Each level has a level of difficulty depending on what item you choose/have. So there might be a level where if you have super jump it will be lower on the difficulty scale than if you have wall crawling. You can still complete it with both but wall crawling will be harder. You could also have/choose a completely irrelevant item to the level (think a level with high walls and large gaps and you pick laser sword) and complete the level but it will be max difficulty.\n\nDoes this already exist? If not, does it sound like a good premise?"
b5pbm5,Medieval Swat,"This might be an idea too late because I have a feeling we are going to   \nbe saturated with swat games soon but still could work.   \n\n\nSo what I was thinking is a realistic swat game where you need to clear out and rescue civilians and take down ""terrorists"". The catch being you are in a medieval setting using bows, swords, shields, crossbows. You could have vip rescue targets like nobles and peasants that would give you less experience or funding from the king.  \n\n\nWhat I think would also be cool (in a modern day swat game even) is having it be an open world where you need to transport your gear and such to a certain location, scope out the safest way to enter, clearing civilians, actually transporting to ""terrorists"" back to the dungeon just to make everything feel organic and like you are in control.   \n\n\nI think the charm in it would be in taking a tactical experience and putting it in a setting it doesn't really fit and could open up a lot of creativity. Pulling up to a heretics house in a horse drawn cart peaking around corners and telling people to put their hands up at bow point sounds kind of fun to me.    "

b5mtoi,A game about being a medieval Guard-Captain,"Premise\n\nThe premise of the game is that you are an up and coming guard-captain who has been tasked to deal with crime in your little village, and beyond. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nConcept\n\nThe idea is that at both night and during the day you can assign guards to patrols in your village. I'm going to make this bullet point form.\n\n1. The whole game is from a top down view. \n2. The guards patrol and stop/solve crimes as they go along their assigned routes. \n3. Longer routes can have more guards, though, new guards have to be hired periodically to allow more routes to be assigned. \n4. At the change of the guard (dawn and dusk) you assign new guards and new patrols for the next time period. \n5. Guards have a morale meter and when they stop/solve crimes, they get a boost in their morale. If you lose a guard through accident or murder, the morale of all guards is reduced for a time. Their morale slowly degrades when they don't see action after a period of time, necessitating the constant movement of guards through high-activity sectors to keep their morale high.\n6. Guards with high morale move faster, are more responsive to crimes, and have an increased sight/hearing radius.\n7. Periodically, the player receives reports with crime hotspots to allow them to make routes to deal with the crime problem. \n8. At the end of each time period, the player receives funds based on the crimes they have stopped which they can spend on hiring new guards or improving their weapons/armour/training.\n9. The player can hire investigators to investigate murders and criminal organisations, interrogators to get information from informants and criminals, and judges to dispense justice to wrongdoers. \n10. All hired members of the guard have hidden corruption ratings that can increase or decrease according to things like their pay, their working conditions, and their morale. Corruption will need to be dealt with over time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStory\n\nThe general story is that the guard-captain is new to the job and begins by being posted to a small village with a crime problem and corrupt guards. They will need to sort out the corruption and solve the crime problems. Once the problems have been broadly solved, the guard-captain will be assigned to a larger village or town with new problems. The problems could potentially be randomly generated for replayability. Over time and through working through larger and larger towns, it becomes apparent that there is a shadowy criminal cartel operating in the kingdom and it is up to the guard-captain to bring down the cartel one piece at a time.

b5misi,A stealth game about being shoemaker elves that secretly help a poor human family with their tasks.,"I'm a fan of The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap and the titular Minish/Picori, the mouse-like elves that secretly live beside humans. They're a reference to a German tale about tiny elves that help a poor shoemaker at night while he sleeps. The idea of these tiny magical creatures helping a needy family despite risking getting caught pulls at my heart strings, and I think could make for a decent story-heavy stealth game.\n\nThe game involves staying hidden as you ""Ratatouille"" your way throughout the house to help with real-time tasks. Meanwhile, the human family's scripted story plays out all around you. There's a struggling single parent dealing with serious issues, a helpless baby, and a young child trying his/her best to take care of their baby sibling. Your magical race isn't supposed to interact with humans, so you are breaking the rules to help them."

baa1e9,Esports CEO,The idea of the game is you start out hosting a small tourney for a game weather is a team game like league of legends or smash bros. Some teams become super teams and you get more fans of they win too long people get bored. You get more money which means more exposure ads and bigger tournament areas. More players start to know of your tourney so more teams more fans. Get sponsorships. Players can retire you can add pregame shows or after shows. Better employs mean better production but more play. The goal is too become the biggest tournament out of all games. You put your own money for the prize pools. You can check how other tournaments are doing and teams or players can switch which could make you lose money if you don't entice then with money or better team quality
ba1kdn,A tycoon style game where you run a farming empire,"**Premise**\n\nThe premise of the game is that you are a wealthy person investing in primary production chains to make money. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Concept**\n\nYou start out with a small farm to manage. You hire a workforce and watch it create money. The difference here is that there are a large number of options animal and crop farms, and each plot of farmland is procedurally generated. You have to look carefully on what will work through overlays to ensure that what you farm will be profitable in both the short and long term. I'll detail some ideas below, with their natural extensions. The extensions would make much more money, but require a significant investment to build. Without the extensions, the player would have to sell to yards and abattoirs, but would not make as much money. \n\nOnce established, the farms would run fairly autonomously, but the player could buy extensions to the farms, expansions into new farmland, manage herd sizes, manage purchase of different quality feeds and fertilisers, and find new contracts for the produce or animal products. \n\nOnce the player is running their first farm successfully and has enough money in the bank, they could purchase a new, randomly generated farm from a list of potential options. The people they could employ and fire would be randomly generated as well. I see the game as a top-down game in general, as it is a strategy game. Random events like drought, fire, and other such disasters could play an important role in keeping play interesting for the life of the game. Players could also sell farms, meaning that a viable strategy could be to buy up unused farmland, create a farm, and, once successful, sell it for much, much more than they purchased it for. Alternatively, the player could also buy up failing/failed farms to retrofit or restructure and sell off as surviving, profitable farms. \n\nOver time, the player would have an ever-expanding portfolio of farms that they manage. They would actively have to be upgrading things on the farms, ensuring profitability, selling and buying farms, and managing simplified supply chains. \n\nThere would be room for a campaign where the player receives a small hobby farm that they inherited in a state of disrepair, that is on the edge of ruin. They fix up the farm and then either sell it or buy a new farm to start from scratch. This could also work as the tutorial level in which the player is introduced to all of the concepts of the game. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Farm Ideas (Animal)**\n\nBeef - Leather, Dairy or Beef farms, with a creamery, cheesemaking, tannery, or abattoir extensions. \n\nPork - Pork, or Leather, with abattoir or tannery extensions. \n\nSheep/Lamb - Lamb, Leather, Milk, or Wool, with abattoir, tannery, creamery/cheesemaking, or shearing shed extensions. \n\nGoat - Leather, Kid Leather, Meat, or Milk, with cheesemaking, tannery, or abattoir. \n\nPoultry - Turkey, Duck, or Chicken farms, with an abattoir. \n\nVenison - Meat, with an abattoir. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Farm Ideas (Crops)** \n\nThe number of crops, with extensions, is virtually limitless, with both food crops, (animal) feed crops, and crops for non-food use like the production of alcohol or ethanol for transport fuel. Tree farms could also be an option for a longer term strategy that would pay off massively after 15-20 years, and the same with orchards. Tree farms and orchards would be later game options for players with more money to spend. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI really like this idea for a game, and, personally, I would play the shit out of a game like this.

b9wxpi,Idea for a plague doctor mechanic?,"In a game where you can be a cleric, hunter, witch... defeating monsters, i would like to have a character designed around a plague doctor.\n\nIssue is that i can't think of a single thing to help him be effective choice because there are no parties where he can just be a healer and not have him be just a weird hybrid of other classes"

You find him, kill him and from there game opens up for you to play on your own with only mission being ""clear the city"".\n\nYou can develop your style of play going more for a hunter style (setting up traps and bait for your prey).\n\nBe a cleric cleaning coruption thru prayers.\n\nA regular warrior killing all in your sight and so on.\n\nAs the game progresses you lose the need to come to ""the order"" because you've set up your own base and are doing your own thing until at the end a new recruit comes for you.\nSent by ""the order"" to remove you because you are no longer considered being an agent but the very thing they sent you to do.\n\nIf you were playing as cleric, the beasts started seeing you as a god, if you were a warrior killing all you became one of those monsters controlling their teritory and if you were a hunter, you became the predator.\n\nIn that final battle, the new recruit kills you and the cycle just keep going around.\n"

b9p52m,Need help on my eternal terrarium idea,"Hey guys, so I work in a childcare centre and I make my own personal games on the side, I've been trying to think of a game I can bring to work for the kids to play (4-5 years) that I will also enjoy making and playing, so I came up with this idea to manage your own eternal terrarium.\n\nIf you don't know what a terrarium is real quick it's just an enclosed mini garden basically with its own eco system that grows and sustains on its own.\n\nSo the gameplay would start with an empty terrarium where you place things like moss, microscopic organisms in water and just small things like that (I'll have to do my research on what grows in terrariums) and as you place them they will naturally grow on their own spreading and getting larger which earns you points that you use to unlock and buy new plants and creatures. And the goal of the game is to develop an entire sustainable ecosystem in your terrarium and unlock all the plant types in a category (rainforest, desert, marsh etc.). Whilst expanding your terrarium you must make sure plants arent using too much oxygen/co2/leaving too much moisture which will kill succulent type plants but also making sure there isn't too much water being used drying out the eco system as well as manage things inside your terrarium that will damage the eco system but are necessary for certain plants and life. There will be a robot in the terrarium ""Terra boy"" who will help you diagnose things wrong in your terrarium by saying small phrases like ""it's getting really hot in here"" etc. \n\n\nThe game will have a few different modes so kids mode will not have co2 or anything tricky like that, pretty much just a sandbox terrarium, an easy mode that is more suitable for primary school students where an almost stable eco system is pre generated and the children can play from there. And a regular mode where advanced challenges like pH levels co2:O2 etc. All plays a part in your eco systems life.\n\nThe game will be generally peaceful and aimed at making a relaxing and positive experience, something to play when you're bored or something for kids to learn about how eco systems work. People will also be able to share their terrariums online with other players.\n\nI would like your ideas on how I can expand this idea, any challenges that you can think of or some features that would make the game more enjoyable for longer? Any idea for an endgame? Any help would be great Tia."
b9ludw,Political-History Simulator,"This idea would be a basic political simulation game, largely mirroring the mechanics of [*Galimulator*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/808100/Galimulator/). \n\n*Galimulator* is a political simulation for various states on a galactic scale. The player observes the rise and fall of empires across the galaxy. A state is capable of basic diplomacy, territorial disputes, and technological advancements. The game produces graphs and charts that record the rich history of it's simulation. \n\nI was thinking of a game extremely similar to *Galimulator*, except it would be based on a single planet.\n\nThis game would overlook a randomly generated world, which would be the stage for thousands of years of civilization. Nations would humbly begin at the dawn of the agricultural revolution, and slowly advance throughout time to the modern era. \n\nThe simplicity of this game is maintained through its functioning. For example, [here's a time lapse of a galaxy in Galimulator. ](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=77VM2OIDJVI)\n\nThe most difficult part about creating this political simulator for a planet, would be the coding behind the simulation itself. The visual aspect of the game is simple.\n\nWith this game, rich histories of nations and cultures can be observed throughout centuries of time! Watch empires rise and fall, alliances form and shatter, or wars won and lost. Overlook the history of each world by viewing graphs and statistics. \n\nWhat do you guys think?\n\nHow possible is this idea?\n\n"
b9ls7b,Anthem + FFXIV + FFXV = An MMO without the outdated WoW hotbar gameplay,"So I was talking to my friends about the shortfalls of Anthem, and the major shortfall we all agreed on was how small the world is and how looting/leveling after the main story seemed kind of pointless since there was no PVP or place to really use it after you've maxed out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think what gives players longevity in a game is something to work toward, and I'm not sure if I've ever even heard of an MMO that steps outside of the tradition WoW style. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo take Anthem, all the Javelin classes (or add more in the future too), the flight, the beautiful environment (especially the underwater environments), and scale it up to a world the size of a typical MMO like FFXIV. Also add competitive PVP so players can strive for better gear and skins to fight each other as well. Maybe add 8+ player raids. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWould also be cool to implement some kind of hand-to-hand hack and slash combat similar to end game FFXV (not FFXIV). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThoughts?"

Simple right?\n\nHowever, as you stay next to the string, your character can feel vibrations in the string that warn you of the “monster” being near.

However going out of sight of the string risks it teleporting somewhere else, encouraging hiding until absolutely necessary or when the monster is closer than you thought. The monster is slow yet threatening due to it’s teleportation and eyes.\n\nNote: This is a pretty unrefined idea for a horror game I’m thinking of making in the future. I’ve gotten into game development recently, and just started learning about this kind of stuff :D\n\n"

b973u7,Tron + Rocket League + One Bullet= Motor Royale?,"I was thinking of a 3rd person game where in the main game mode, players are on either teams or solos and each have a motorcycle (sorta like a Tron style design) and a single ""disc"" (designed like the identity disc). The disc is the only weapon each player has, but is one-shot kill. Players throw the disc at other players and can recall the disc, flying back to the owner.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlayers can use their motorcycle to drive around the arena map and can pick up energy cells that spawn to boost their speed. Players can also boost their vehicles or jump midair to do flips or spins to dodge other discs (like in Rocket League)  and even slide on the ground (motorcycle slide). When you boost, your smoke leaves behind a temporary jet trail that can kill other players should they smash into it (like Tron).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlayers can also start with different powerups as they would like. For example: a player could start with a full boost bar vs. half-full, or a player could fire a temporal burst disc that temporally multiplied whenever it hits something.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWorld: Arena with ramps and curves all around in a semi Rocket League- Tron type of lighting and design, with glow in the dark vehicles during a ""blackout"" mode, and tournaments.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTell me what you think?"
b96oyp,Would it be wrong if I worked on a game inspired by John Wick?,"I'm currently trying to work with a team on creating 3rd person action game that has melee combat and shooting combined but I wanted to have the character heavily inspired by John Wick and even very influenced stages and bad guys from the movie.

b91o51,Wizards vs Warlocks,"The idea for this game is simple, there are two teams set on opposite sides of a smallish map. These teams are the wizards and the warlocks, there is an objective that needs to be completed by one of the teams like TF2 so that it’s not just a boring TDM game. The catch with this game is that everyone starts off as the same character, the same basic attacks and permanent buffs randomly spawn around the map. You can’t walk into a fight with a pre-built build, the game would change and react as things go. Your skills would be divided into schools of magic like healing, shielding, explosions and more. The spells you have you need to find around the map  and using those spells in game will level up your skills and these level ups will not carry over. "
b912vv,A SimCity style game where you also create a system of laws and influence the culture of your city.,"The game wouldn't just simulate things like population density, traffic and happiness, but would simulate the aspects of a culture.

"
b90ul6,3D Co-op Rogue-lite,"**Fusion Mechanic**\n\nA 3D co-op rogue-lite where at the start of the run all players a given a pre-made random character with a basic ability. Some examples for these abilities would be the ability to swim in water, or the ability to pick up and carry one ally. Upon finding a certain item in the game, called the fusion crystal, players will have the option to ""fuse"" their characters into one stronger and larger character with both of the weaker character's abilities combined into the fusion. For example, if the players who were given the swimming character and the character who can pick up and carry allies decided to use the fusion crystal they found to fuse, the fusion of these two characters would be able to carry allies across water. Once the players decide to fuse, the game will pause and ask who wants to control the character. If both players queue for control, it will be randomly decided. If no players queue for control, it will also be randomly decided. Fusions will last until a player decides to disband the fusion, which will bring both smaller characters and the fusion crystal back. Now, the game will allow for up to four people to be in a run, so what if everyone tried to fuse? A rarer and more powerful fusion crystal will be needed for three people to be in a fusion, and an even rarer one will be needed for four people. However, if two normal fusion crystals are brought to a certain NPC, they can be combined into a rare fusion crystal, which will allow three characters to fuse. If three normal fusion crystals are brought to the NPC, they can we combined into a legendary fusion crystal, which will allow all players to fuse. Combining these fusion crystals will cost the player their coins. Coins do not carry over through runs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Levels/Rooms**\n\nUpon starting the game, players will spawn in a basic room that shows nothing but the type, or biome, that they spawned in (volcano, snowy, water-based). There will be a door on every side of the starting room. The game will be split-screen locally, so the players can go away on their own, but cannot progress to a new floor or area without everyone being there. Once players enter a new room, there could be many different things. The most common room are those filled with enemies. These enemies will be biome-specific, so snow enemies with only be found in snow biomes, volcanic enemies will only be found in volcanic biomes, etc. Enemies may be guarding an item, a door, or nothing at all. Another thing that could be in a room is an item or door that leads to a new area. These may sometimes be unable to get to without certain characters or fusions, and if they are, they are usually very important and interesting items. Sometimes, players may enter a boss room. There will always be a boss guarding a legendary fusion crystal, or a door to a rare biome. Upon defeating a boss, they will always drop a fusion crystal, and possibly another item that relates to the boss. Another type of room are shop or NPC rooms. These rooms will be filled with different NPC's, many of them at their own post that you can buy services from. Attacking these NPC's will cause that specific tribe that the NPC was from to no longer appear to sell you goods and services, but as difficult enemies for the rest of that run. However, attacking the shopkeepers will cause most of them to flee, except for maybe a blacksmith that owns a sword that will stay to fight. Once the shopkeepers flee, their items can be stolen. Even though NPCs from that specific tribe will no longer appear except as enemies, you can still find rooms with a different tribe that will still sell you goods and services. However, there will usually only be one tribe per biome.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Character Types**\n\nAll characters will be classified under three categories. These categories are combat, movement, and support. A character can be classified under multiple categories. All characters that have been discovered will be listed in a journal on the menu screen.\n\nCombat - Combat characters will usually have an active ability. For example, a character that can shoot a fireball will have to press a button to shoot the fireball, then the ability will be on cooldown for some number of seconds. It won't be as common, but they can still have a passive ability. An example for this would be an ice characters attacks freezing the enemy after some number of hits.\n\nMovement - Characters that are classified strictly under movement will have a movement ability that is strictly limited for their own use. For example, the swimming character mentioned earlier. These movement abilities can be used to possibly retrieve an item then bring it back to the other players.\n\nSupport - Characters that are classified under only support will have an ability that helps their teammates and possibly themselves. However, if they help themselves in movement or combat they will be classified under Support/Movement or Support/Combat. These support abilities can range from helping a character in combat by making them more powerful, or helping them in movement by throwing them across a river that they otherwise would not have passed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease give feedback on what you would change, or whether you think this is an interesting idea in the replies, also don't hesitate to leave a comment asking a question about something I might have forgotten to mention."
b90b8k,Need spell ideas for a mage who can't help the hero directly.,I'm making a game where you need to rely on a mage's help to survive.

b8vyxr,"A mod for fallout 4 that lets you do graffiti (draw, paint, spraypaint) on any structure in the wasteland.","As someone that used to love graffiti I can not think of a cooler place to freely be able to draw and paint all over whatever you wanted than the dilapidated abandoned buildings, water towers, subway tunnels, trains, cars and all the other prime surfaces in the fallout world. You would have a ladder to go vertical and do stuff as big as possible (you could even have special markers, drippy ink mops, fire extinguishers filled with paint, rollers to do giant block letters and other real life graffiti tools). It could just be be a choice in your inventory that gives you a paint pallet of colors, thicknesses of lines and other basic stuff. It could use the cross hairs to aim with a paint can. Maybe have a way to fill letters or paint whole walls quickly. The stuff would be permanent as long as you stayed on the same save and you could literally custom paint the entire waste land if you wanted which would make the game so I cool to me. I already posted this on r/FalloutMods and I wanted to see what you guys thought. Maybe there is some other games this mechanic could be modded into and if done well enough it could literally turn the games into one of the first ""graffiti games"" without actually creating a whole game based around vandalizing a city with graffiti.. Which doesn't too bad to me either."

Details below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe player would adventure the world, fight monsters/bandits/etc, dive into caves and dungeons and collect loot and resources to create (a) settlement(s). The player would continue to adventure in this way, collecting resources to further expand and upgrade their settlement(s), meanwhile enemy AI would settle a ""rival"" settlement for each settlement the play creates and these rival settlements would slowly expand and upgrade to match player's settlement progression. Rival settlements  would continue to expand with the player's until the player actively leads a military assault on the enemy settlement, at which point they could either destroy and eliminate that threat, or just cause damage and force the enemy to rebuild the lost structures over a period of time.\n\nSettlements would require basic resource management in the form of Homes (population), Farms (food), Lumber Mills (wood), Quarries (stone), Mines (ore), and Trade Depots (gold). Players could also build Blacksmiths, General Stores, and Alchemy Shops that would create actual stores for the player to purchase weapons, armor, adventuring gear, and potions/elixers/poisons for their character.

Some are dark and authoritarian, some are hedonistic and weird, some are post-apocalyptic.  \n\nThe player would see different possible futures for the various NPCs in the town, both good and bad.  Some futures might be great for one NPC, and terrible for another.  \n\nThrough collecting information and items from the various possible futures, the player can complete quests in the present which close off some futures and sometimes open others (accessing new levels).  Eventually there's just one future left, and the end of the game is seeing that future become real, and then seeing that happens *after* that future (whether it actually turns out as intended or not).  The player has to make choices over which futures to keep as they go, so they have to decide which NPCs they're going to value the most.\n\n"
b83jg4,Rust meets Ark Survival meets Day-Z meets The Last of Us,"There should be a large scale role playing, survival game focused on crafting supplies to succeed. There needs to be a good survival game with a large urban environments as well as vast woods and lakes and deserts and all types of environments. There would be PvP as well as PvE with wild animals as well as zombies. The zombies would just be walking around chilling and killing people in the cities and the bigger the cities the more of them."
b802le,Game Idea Horror/Survival,"Game idea it’s horror based you begin in a forest or a cornmaze and you run away from people with weapons and there are many senarioes that can happen such as someone could activate a switch where a murderer appears and chases the closes person and it switches to who ever is in the raidius it could be a variety of Different Senators such as A Little Girl holding a Chainsaw and Supply Drops which play haunting music and increase in noise and pops when it can be open or it appears when the noise ends. The sound for the supply drop could vary but I thought of the idea that A Child Giggling and then Getting Louder And Louder Till it finally gives you the crate. There could be cutscenes when people see the killers and death scenes could be for example if a Person was hiding Under a Tornado shelter door and one of the killers happened to find it. A cut Scene would happen which would happen if a killer caught up to you the would Speak and could Say something Like “Found you” and then maybe a death scene or a black screen and it says you died and it could be played on dedicated servers which would allow a vast majority of people to play at once and new stuff could be added In for characters Eg Outfits, Cutscenes And Many More. The Killers could be Ai or you could be the Killer there are different servers for people who want to play against the ai Killers and the other players who want to Play against Real killers would Go onto a Different server.The Game would Be interesting to see and I hope what will be Useful if anyone Wants to take this idea up.\nSorry for Not Much punctuation.

The heros could have 4 abilities that cost mana (or whatever it will be called) and an ultimate that charges based on damage output.  They could also have weapon combos with light and heavy attacks like they do in dynasty warriors. There would be ranged heros like archers, knife throwers, crossbows (maybe some light magic). Characters would range in mobility and weapon range and speed.  There would be dodging and blocking mechanics for fun fast paced duels and team encounters as well as killing mobs in the lanes.

At this period, the Factions change into: The West, The Eastern block, and Germany.\n\nThe next period would be the 2000-2020 period, where you unlock even more technology, buildings and laws. Here the Factions are: Capitalists and Socialists.\n\nThen comes the space age, where you are able to expand your country more, until you take over a small scale version of earth, and then start exploring the solar system, sending astronauts to other planets, where they come across alien species you can trade with, each planet has their own Faction.\nAnother thing you could do in the space age would be building a Dyson ring around the sun for energy for your planet, as well as to sell to other planets, and asteroid mining etc.."

bby7tb,Dragon Rancher,"TL;DR- Imagine a humorous Single-Player focused Farming/Animal Husbandry Simulator with elements of survival, exploration, and combat. There’s also multiplayer in the form of The Dragon Races.\n\nStyle: if you haven’t seen Love, Death, and Robots on Netflix I suggest you do so. Specifically the episode called “Suits” as that is the overall style you should be thinking of. It’s sort of a 3D Storybook aesthetic, and I feel it would suit this fantasy setting well. It’s comedic overtones help mask the complicated systems behind the game.\n\nCore Gameplay: You create a character and then start the game with a simple little farmhouse, a dragon stable, and one of three starter dragons. Your goal is to expand your property and to breed more and more powerful dragons. To do this you will need money and supplies. You get these in various ways:\n\n1. Exploring- you leave your property mounted on a dragon of your choosing. You then gather things like wood, stone, and a lot of other typical survival materials. You use these to build out your your property. You can also find straight up gold and other treasures out in the wilderness that you can appraise and then sell.\n\n2. Racing- You ride your best dragon in the hopes of winning out against other real players. There’s several modes to choose from: The Standard 8 Player line up, first to reach the finish line or the appropriate number of laps wins, there’s also Last Rider Down, there are no lap limits, every time you cross the line the last person to cross is eliminated, and finally there’s Dragon Brawl, like a typical race, minus the rules, there no restrictions on breath attacks, and the track is laden with power-ups like a Kart game, you’ll want more than just a fast dragon for this mode. Winning any of these always comes with a cash prize, consecutive wins come with additional randomized prizes that can be anything from treasure, building supplies, to even dragons depending on the length of your streak.\n\n3.Dragon Breeding- you can either earn enough money to buy a dragon from another player, or you can find one out in the wilderness to tame and bring home, as long as you have the space. Once you have two mature dragons you can breed them, learning what sub-species will and won’t breed is a matter of trial and error. You can always breed the same sub-species for a guarantee of course. You can then sell these dragons/eggs to other players in the market place, or for a flat constant rate in the same place you sell treasure. [More details on Dragon Breeding below...]\n\n4. Farming- You can grow your own supplies, you just need to return with the required amount from the wilderness and have an open plot of land. Should you find yourself with excess you can take your harvest to the marketplace to barter and sell it to players, or for a flat rate to the general store.\n\n5. Odd Jobs- NPC’s in town will have certain jobs available for you to complete, they range from things like pest extermination, finding lost cattle, and even landscaping. Some dragons have useful talents that make these odd jobs much easier. \n\n\nStory: You live in the fantastical land of Verdaxia, unlike other fantastical settings this one takes place during the turn of the century. Imagine a world filled with dragons and all manner monsters and magic, that is in the middle of an industrial revolution. You have lucked out however, when Uncle Seamus dies. He leaves you his rinky dink ranch out in the middle of nowhere, and your character is ecstatic, anything to escape the horrible conditions of factory life. Once at the ranch you find it’s a bit more rundown than you expected, but while cleaning the place up you discover a family history you never knew about. Your family, for generations bred and raced dragons, and were very good at it. However they invested their winnings in the birth of the machine age and were enriched beyond their wildest dreams. They gave up racing and ranching and became part of the Aristocracy. They were not wise with their money however, and when times got tough they lost it all, eventually leading to their last remaining descendant (you) being forced to maintain the dangerous machinery they helped proliferate. The story really only ends when you want it to, but the goal is to return your family name to the status it once held, as the best Dragon Ranchers in Verdaxia. \n\nMultiplayer: while there are multiplayer elements, the game really is primarily focused on immersing a single player. The only times you’ll be encountering other players are in the Races, the Marketplace, and if a player chooses to visit your ranch, or vice-versa. Outside of those instances gameplay is focused on the single player experience.\n\nRelationships: like Harvest Moon there’s is a town, this is where the market place is, it’s also where the NPC’s gather, they will have jobs for you to complete. The more jobs you do for someone, the more they will like you, eventually you can pursue that in the form of a relationship with them. You can even have kids with them who will grow up and you will then play as, continuing on the family legacy. You customize your kids with a simple slider that blends your features and that of the NPC you’ve chosen to be with. It may take several generations to return your family’s lost glory.\n\nCombat: You can use tools like a shovel or your woodsman’s axe to deal mediocre damage, there are also crude musket-like firearms, mostly what you want to do is use your pheromone pellet gun to direct your dragon. Shooting a hostile with it will set your dragon into aggressive mode and they’ll attack the target until it is terminated. Your main job in combat is to enjoy the show and not get caught underfoot. You’re dragons combat is much like that of the \nmonster battles you’d come across in MHW. Certain sub-species might be advantageous against a certain enemy type. Where you’re starter dragon might have a long drawn out battle, another sub-species might just annihilate the poor creature who was making your life hell. There is a food chain in place, taking advantage of this will make for much smoother gathering of supplies. When taming a wild dragon you’ll need to call your dragon off at the right time or else it’ll lose too much health and die. \n\nMore on Dragons: there are a ludicrous number of dragon species. You pick one of three basic starter dragons when you begin the game. You then use this dragon to find, defeat, and tame other dragons which you then use to breed and/or complete odd jobs. The starter dragons are:\n\n1.Crimson Drake- the basic all rounder, has decent HP, deals average damage, has good speed, has a reasonable gestation period, and is incredibly easy to breed, all you need is another one. \n\n2.Verdant Drake- slightly smaller than the Crimson Drake, with less HP and damage output, it is however much faster, it also has a very quick gestation period. It does require greenery around the farm in order to meet its breeding requirements however.\n\n3. Mountain Drake- a bulky brown dragon that is excellent for taming. Though they are not quick, they are very hardy and deal extra knockout damage with their special headbutt move, they take a while to gestate and require a burrow to breed.\n\nTaming- once you’re dragon has dealt enough damage to daze your target you must then climb onto the dazed dragon and get to a special pressure point that exists on the dragon’s body, once you’ve reached it you dramatically jab it with a couple fingers, the dragon twinges a bit and then comes out of the daze as friendly as can be. Some dragons will have multiple points and will attempt to shake you off between presses. Once tamed many dragons have special abilities that assist you, one sub-species might not be the fastest or the most dangerous, but if you have it on the ranch it’ll water your crops for you, and another dragon might use bioluminescence allowing you to easily look for supplies in the dark. There’s lots of gameplay reasons to breed and discover new sub-species, more than just to find the fastest or the hardest kill dragon. Some places in the wilderness are completely inaccessible without a certain type of dragon.\n\nBreeding- This first part pertains to breeding of the same sub-species specifically. The dragons function on a system of simple stats, Health, Speed, damage, and Carry Weight, there is a universal base set of stats that the breeding calculations use. It’s likely that no dragon will actually spawn with these exact base stats as dragon stats are randomized (within reason). When you breed dragons the game takes the stats of the two dragons and averages them. The numbers that wind up above the base stat are given an additional bonus, numbers that fall below suffer a slight subtraction. If the averaged stat comes out to be within the window of the base stat it doesn’t receive any bump, positive or negative. This allows you to breed a line of thoroughbreds that could become your primary source of income, with other players clamoring to get one of your renowned stock. When breeding dragons of different sub-species it’s a whole different ball game. Certain species combine to make new ones that will have completely randomized stats (within reason, the values depend on the species). The more combinations it takes to reach a sub-species the rarer it is, meaning the most likely way to even see the really powerful dragons is to discover them through breeding. No matter the circumstances breeding can be a crapshoot, much like actual genetics, there is the slight chance that you’ll get a prime genetic fluke that starts your thoroughbred line, or your thoroughbreds come together to make a genetic dud. This randomness adds to excitement of breeding, you don’t truly know what you’re gonna get in some cases.\n\n\nI’ve always loved when dragons are treated more like real living biological things rather than something supremely mystical. Plus I loved Víva Piñata and there’s hasn’t really been a game that’s given me that same sense of satisfaction whenever I learned secrets and discovered unique variants of piñata. This would be a complicated game for sure, but I think that’s why it would fit in with this new generation of games that are less detailed in appearance, but have incredible depth to their systems. Mainly though I’ve just been thinking about a video game in the art style of that “Suits” episode of Love, Death, and Robots, and this is the vision that eventually formed in my mind. I seriously recommend you watch it, it’s definitely one of the more SFW ones, there’s no tits or anything, they just swear and some cows get fucked up."

bbsov1,Great Emu War Rail Shooter,"\nInspirations: [The Great Emu War](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/NZQPu) [Jurassic Park arcade game](https://youtu.be/ZXZOw0lwnKI) [let’s go jungle](https://youtu.be/nnKfTR4CGmY)and [let’s go island](https://youtu.be/I7QapIo6IR0)\n\nPremise: A first person Rail Shooter where the players ride atop a truck and gun their way out of an exaggerated Australian Outback filled with deadly wildlife. Use your Lewis machine gun with unlimited ammo to mow down hoards of aggressive emus, giant crocodiles and spiders, baby eating dingoes, and vicious dropbears!\n\nEmbrace every Australian stereotypes to a goofy extreme, with things like vegemite sandwich health packs or boomerang weapon power ups. The two shooters as well as the truck driver will provide colorful commentary as you play to break up possible monotony.\n\nThe comedic tone and nostalgia for playing old school arcade rail shooters at Chuck E. Cheese are the major appeals for this game, but it could bring in some ideas to spice up the rail shooter experience.\n\n- Branching paths for different missions. For example, after completing the first mission, you can choose to go to the gum tree forest infested with dropbears or the dangerous rapids filled with man eating reptiles.\n- Play with local or network co-op. Double the amount of ammo you’ll waste with two crosshairs in screen!\n- Free play and veteran mode. Choose between a mode where death doesn’t matter or take up the challenge to risk starting over upon death of both players.\n- Some special enemies have bounties you can cash in for items after completing a mission. Get weapon power ups and healing items to increase your survivability or open up secret routes.\n\nIt’s not much but I would estimate it would be a lower budget game that would be fun to play a few times with a friend and replay a dormant genre again."
bbsg3a,"A Breakout style block breaker game when you are a giant monster like Rampage, and you're using a giant tennis racket",
bbqj1k,A stealth game where the protagonist is blind...but has ECHOLOCATION,"Right. So I only have the basic idea at the moment but I think there's hidden potential here.\n\nThe premise is that the protagonist has to sneak into enemy bases, take out the guards, accomplish their mission, and jazz on out, right? Well, that's made more challenging by the fact that the main character is completely blind, so they have no perception of light or anything related to it. They don't know when they're in light or in shadows and can't read signs or documents, including maps.\n\nBUT they do have innate echolocation so they can sense and ""image"" their environment at all times, even in perfect darkness, by the use of sound. They can use environmental sounds (such as talking guards) or produce their own at the risk of drawing attention (maybe there's a mid-endgame item that produces ultrasonic pings only you can hear?). \n\nI was thinking making it take place around WW2 so it predates the use of sophisticated technology like surveillance/thermal cameras and DNA testing, just so it makes sense why anyone would send a blind operative (even one with echolocation) alone into an enemy base. Kinda like a noir detective/spy game. As such the equipment and tools at your disposal would be limited to those of the time period. You could use a basic pistol (that draws a lot of attention and may overwhelm your echolocation) which you could attach a silencer later on. You could have other tools like single-use electrical proximity mines, a chemical grenade that erases guards' immediate memories, and a very useful smoke grenade that blinds everyone in the room except yourself (useful for a quick escape).\n\nThe gameplay would be predominantly stealth-focused. Since it would be impossible to tell whether you're in shadows or not, you'd have to observe and listen to all nearby guards at all times (they'd have appropriate alertness states), and maybe some walls/floors are ""transparent"" to sound. Maybe there are optional electrical switches outside buildings or in the basement you can use to throw the lights out, making the guards rely on flashlights or candles. Since you can't read maps you'd have to memorize the level layouts or, my favorite, overhear guard conversations to get an idea of the place.\n\nThere would be a combat element but your unique circumstance might make that an unwise choice. Any gunfight would quickly incapacitate you, either through sensory overload or by your sheer vulnerability. Gauze and bandages might patch you up a bit but there would be little healing, and heavy body armor would only hinder a spy/detective, so you'd want to stay out of combat as much as possible. You could do stealth kills with a knife or non-lethal takedowns to unsuspecting enemies as alternatives.\n\nThese are just some ideas I have. Maybe someday I'll make something real out of this. Any and all feedback is appreciated."

You can also gain random powers through weird events, much like how a superhero gets their powers in a freak accident.  You can learn to activate magic abilities through following the cryptic clues all over the map. You can also craft sci-fi inventions by finding research journals that tell you how to craft them. The crafting journals put together show you how to make a portal to other dimensions and how to build a spaceship.  \n\n\nAllowing the players who figure this out to venture into different planets and dimensions like in Star Wars and Rick and Morty.  \n\n\nYou can explore, build places to live, hunt monsters by finding their weaknesses (or just shooting them with a laser gun you crafted) , be a wizard, a superhero, or just some guy who travels through space and jumps through dimensions.

Of course, I'm not going to post with just that, and expect the comments section to do all the work, I have several ideas myself. \n\nI'll start with combat. Don't be mistaken by the word 'combat', I don't want something highly complex or anything close to a simulation. Just something different to jumping on things. One way to do this may be giving Mario a weapon (let's be honest, he's too fat to kick or punch), something simple like a hammer, no guns, swords, axes, etc., and adding a health system would make enemies seem less insignificant (2-3 hits to kill, rather than just 1). Obviously I don't want upgrades or too many weapon types, that would make the game too complex to feel like Mario. Also I don't want to completely remove the option to jump on things, because we all need to do that every so often. Again, I want it simple, but just a bit more exciting.\n\nAnother aspect of the game that could see such improvements would be the actual objectives of the level. Maybe Bowser realized he's not good at hiding things, so the path to complete the level is not a completely straight line like it normally is? Or maybe Mario doesn't need to save peach, just needs to find her after she was caught cheating on him with Luigi? Perhaps Mario is tired of saving Toad and getting the finger so he finds toad and...  I'll let you do the imagining for that one. You get the point. The levels should be a little more different and exciting. \n\nI've said enough. I'd like to hear how you would make Mario just a bit more exciting than it already is."

bbadtn,"A roguelike where you upgrade your weapon, not the player","A roguelike game where each pickup is applied to your weapon instead of the player. The weapons would have stats like durability as an analogue to health, etc.. Upgrades would come in the form of augmentations to the weapon, and these modifiers would build your character. So for example a modifier to a sword that would grant more knockback and range, but cause the player to take more damage. Or your weapon takes no durability damage, but you deal less damage to enemies. Enemies would drop modifications or crafting materials to be spent in a blacksmith or shop to upgrade your weapon."

These bugs can cause chances for data leaks or other PR events which cause more and more info on the company to be made available to the player. You have to manage your reputation by mitigating the disasters that you cause, all while gathering more info on the parent company. Eventually you take them down.

bb8ch9,My game idea called Infinite Nights,"So I played undertale recently and before I go on ahead with my ideas, I have a lot of the dialogue and some sprites created. All i need is 3+ years of gml experience to start attempting to develop the game. So the Ideas for combat are kinda derived from undertale in the way that you could enter different combat styles for fight IE: muffet with the purple strings. I have an idea for one of those kind of fights. One where you have to move in a dpad shape. To avoid projectiles you move to the right left up or down etc. Humor will be similar to the likes of earthbound and undertale. The game will be goofy but will have serious moments from time to time. I hope to finish writing this when I go home, as I am at school rn on my phone."
bb8ajo,I’m new to game making but I’ve been working on a cool long-term project,"My game is a turn-based RPG with rhythm oriented combat. The turn-based RPG part is traditional for the most part, similar to mother, octopath traveller, or final fantasy. The unorthodox part is combat. Following a party of 4, you select an action, the effectiveness of which is determined not by an algorithm, but by a segment of DDR-esque rhythm that the player must complete. The game dialogue will be meta and satirical for the most part with very gripping, heart-wrenching parts sprinkled in. I’m basically working on everything solo except music, a pal or two are doing that. I’m learning a little bit of everything along he way and any little bit goes a long way. I’m using Game maker studio 2."
bb7byc,2 Floors,"A game where it’s set in a house and one person spawns upstairs and another downstairs. Each person can access the out side via opening windows, doors etc and climb up/down drainpipes to flank opponents using household weapons"
bb52k9,Madness Combat VR Game,"Right off the bat I have no intention of developing anything out of this idea as I don't know how to make games in the first place. Its just an idea that's been swimming around in my head.\n\nThe game I have in mind is a first person action game in the style of [Madness Combat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1aubPfepmg&amp;list=PL4F761764995C5F15) by [Krinkels](https://www.krinkels.net/).\n\n**Gunplay:** I've imagined the guns act similar to the ones in Robo Recall, except every bullet isn't slowed down to make it easier not to get hit. Reloading would be automatic because reloading in VR manually is a pain and would be even more of a pain in a combat situation.\n\n**Melee Combat:** Melee combat would act very similarly to Blade &amp; Sorcery. Bladed weapons would be most effective as they would be able to cut enemies and make them bleed. There would be knives, swords, axes, and machetes. Blunt weapons would consist of baseball bats, clubs, hammers, boards, and pipes.\n\n**Tac-Bar:** The Tac-Bar is something that was introduced in Madness: Project Nexus 1 and made its way over to Project Nexus 2. The tac-bar allows the player to dodge bullets as to not take damage from them, but eventually their tac bar will run out. The tac-bar can be refilled by killing enemies. Some enemies will have tac bar's which will require melee or thrown weapons to defeat them, or draining their tac bar with shooting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Enemies (Sprites by** [Krinkels](https://www.krinkels.net/)**):** Enemies will come in various forms, each having different attributes to them.\n\n[Grunt](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/madnesscombat/images/b/ba/Grunt1.png/revision/latest?cb=20120603024324): Grunts are the basic enemies. They have little to no skill in any form of combat, and serve as cannon fodder. They are the first enemies the player would fight in early sections of the game.\n\n[Agent](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/madnesscombat/images/8/81/L33t_MC7.png/revision/latest?cb=20130304042522): Agents have slightly more combat training and are able to use guns and melee weapons more efficiently. They have no tac bar so they are easy targets.\n\n[ATP Engineer](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/madnesscombat/images/1/12/Engineer_MC8.png/revision/latest?cb=20130304054430): The Advanced Training Program Engineers are the first enemies who will have tac-bars. Their tac-bar's aren't large, so they are easy to deplete, but they could mess up your day if you're not careful. Being genetically enhanced soldiers, they sport some yellow blood and better combat skills. They are more accurate with ranged weaponry and are more advanced in melee combat.\n\n[ATP Soldat](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/madnesscombat/images/3/3e/OBSV_basic.png/revision/latest?cb=20130420224230): Another genetically enhanced soldier, these guys are no pushovers. Their tac bars are more advanced and they have the highest skill in melee and ranged combat. They are proper soldiers, and some of the deadliest units.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**How the game works:** The player starts in a hub area. This area contains weapons the player has kept and a shop. It also contains a computer where the player would choose a level to play. Like Blade and Sorcery, there would be multiple levels the player would be able to choose from. These levels would mainly consist of greyscale rooms that would house various weapons. The player moves from room to room, slaughtering all enemies in their way. You win when you kill every single enemy. The reward for winning is cash to buy weapons and EXP to upgrade things like your tac-bar. The player would also be able to buy armor to reduce damage from guns and melee weapons. Levels would have various difficulties, those being Easy mode, Normal Mode, Hard Mode, and Madness Mode. With each difficulty level, the enemies change and their numbers are increased. \n\n**Mag Mode:**  This mode would allow you to play as [Mag Hank (Sprite by Krinkels)](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/265498325581561876/565074686673944577/latest.png). The player would be noticeably larger than the rest of the enemies. The player would have a maxed out tac bar and increased health, along with an arm. The arm would have a charge up attack, allowing you to deal massive damage to any enemy that's hit by it. This mode would just be for fun and as a reward for beating levels on the highest difficulty. \n\n**Gore:** Gore would consist of enemies having visible wounds on them when struck. Blunt weaponry would leave bruises and dents in the enemies head and body. Bladed weaponry would leave cut wounds which would bleed and stain your weapon. They would also be used to decapitate or gut an enemy. Bullets would leave a visible bullet wound which would spurt blood. More powerful guns would allow for head explosions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr, project nexus 2 but first person and VR."

bb1vtu,Prototype Hacking Minigame,"Over the years many AAA and indie game's have had hacking minigames that I would say are inaccurate at best. Whether its an electric version of pipe dream (Bioshock), or more recently turning dials to tune into a signal (Spiderman). How about a minigame where the computer is slowly solving the problem on its own, but you can fill in your answer to try and solve the answer early.  \n\n\nThere are a couple of ways to do this. You could make it solve itself on a time limit by projecting a scrambled message and over time revealing the correct letter until you have the full message. Which simple versions have been done before, I think.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOR you could actually have a genetic algorithm trying to solve the message at the same time. Which is what I've done.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not good at UI Design, and I know all the answers because I know the list of quotes, so I'm releasing this prototype to be used by anyone who wants to try it. You're free to use the idea, hell use the code. Most of it was a rewrite of The Coding Train's videos on genetic algorithms to work in Processing. There are no/few comments so I recommend watching his videos to understand the code.  \n\n\n[Download Link](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/2ejwazp81b2m2k7/AAA-wTtBEXGJW6k_iWtMfHzia?dl=0)\n\n[Screenshot](http://prntscr.com/n9c8yp)"
barc2d,A Marvel-lous Game,"Don't shoot me for being punny...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd love to see a full-fledged Marvel game with the Nine Realms of Yggdrasil and their subsequent Races (Asgardian, Jotunn, Light Elf, Vanir, Human etc...) playable with their own bonuses and fully customisable. Crafting system and Shadow of War's Nemesis System, Mount and Blade type companions and fighting system (customisable armour/ weapons/ stats)... Travel throughout each of the Nine Realms doing quests or going your own way.  \n\n   \nI could envision subpar graphics (Kenshi-level) in exchange for vast swathes of land open for exploration (Kenshi/ Elder Scrolls) and faction exploitation. A dynamic game, where the Realms don't just sit still but fight, expand their cities/ territories (if they have spaceflight), events for sightings of the Infinity Gems, or a Thanos-invasion, failed invasions (e.g. &gt;!Kree trying to bomb Earth to get Captain Marvel!&lt;), meet the big names Thor, Odin, Loki, Thanos, Iron Man... the list goes on and depends on your Race.   \n\n  \nMassive RPG with RTS elements, vast lands on each of the Nine Realms with each depicting their own unique styles. Wouldn't have to follow the MCU, but definitely resemble it to hook players.   "
baoqfb,Need ideas for a 3D browser multiplayer game,"I have been experimenting with Three.js and other browser technologies, and have really wanted to start a new project. I first started out wanting to make a 2D 3/4 perspective pixel-style Battle Royale game in an HTML Canvas, but I'm not so sure anymore. I have kind of moved on to a 3D environment, using Three.js. Do you think this would be the best choice, or should I stick with my 2D pixel-style Battle Royale? If you said 3D, what game idea should I do? I want to do something multiplayer related, where players are involved in gun fights, but I think Battle Royale is too commonly thought of as stale gameplay."

bahsop,Ideas?,Me and some friends are making a game loosely based on bully but with a female protagonist. What are some good ideas for a game over? I don't want her to just lose health and flop over I would like something more intense and sort of cinematic. Do you have any ideas?
bahd6a,Hm...how about combining something like Factorio with a story-driven RPG?,"Hm...\n\nSo I just saw an early preview of 'Satisfactory' on Youtube and I kind of want a game like this but I would combine it with elements of other games, like:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\- The free-running from Assassin's Creed (and similar games from Batman-Arkham games to Spiderman games etc.)\n\n\- The flying from Anthem (without an overheat mechanic and without the low ceiling so that you can fly really high, so Iron-Man-Style!)\n\n\- The RPG-Elements from games like Mass Effect, Dragon Age, Diablo 2, Divinity Original Sin 2, Deus Ex, KOTOR, Jedi Knight etc. (so stuff like direct attack skills, but also energy-shields, invisibility etc.)\n\n\- a great story (will lay out my basic story later)\n\n\- great companion characters and factions (like in Fallout: New Vegas) with interesting quests (and romances)\n\n\- good gun-play (like in the latest Doom for example!)\n\n\- good CQC (Assassin's Creed up to Black Flag...I prefer the old combat system to the one in the newer AC-Games!)\n\n\- multiple approaches to quests (guns blazing, negotiations, stealth, hacking etc.)\n\n\- a lot of diverging paths (like in Dragon Age: Origins or Fallout: New Vegas)\n\n\- SILENT PROTAGONIST! No auto-dialogue etc. (ruins immersion for me!)\n\n\- good dialogue-system (again: New Vegas style! Not Mass Effect with the Wheel!)\n\n\- seamless transitions (of if not possible: Mass Effect 1 style elevator scenes or something, so no load-screens :) )\n\n\- semi-open world (multiple planets/areas)\n\n\- Witcher 3 style side-quests (no pointless fetch-quests like in Dragon Age: Inquisition!)\n\n\- RPG-Style equipment system (armors, weapons, tools, implants etc.)\n\n\- Crafting (upgrading your armor, weapons etc.)\n\n\- command and equip your companions and take personal control if you feel the need (so Dragon Age: Origins like here, too!)\n\n\- tactical pause\n\n\- Many skills being usable in combat (not just 3 like in Anthem)\n\n\- no classes (select what you want from the skills!)\n\n\- several building options (you can build in an Anno or Command and Conquer like UI or do so in first/3rd person perspective (true builders probably want to see the map from above to build in order to fully utilize space, have your base look beautiful and be clean (no unneccessary ways etc.))\n\n\- Vehicles (Battlefield-Style!)\n\n\- etc. (maybe some other stuff ;) )\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs for the basic story?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou start out on a space-ship, either in a battle or after some catastrophic failure (the ship is going down) - maybe through sabotage - and you have to rescue the crew etc. so that you can escape via the escape-pods...so fight your way through the ship, have some early decisions (which way to go, maybe even who to rescue (don't know if I want to lose some characters this early on...but it is a possibility) or which things to take with you (take more tools or better guns etc.)).\n\nAfter that: Drop onto the new world and some survival elements (not stuff like hunger etc. - seriously, I don't like games that make you eat etc....I do that in RL, that's enough!)\n\nCollecting the other survivors (and maybe getting them in line if they aren't willing to follow you etc.)\n\nBuilding up a base!\n\nMaybe gathering allies (maybe the planet has inhabitants, who have factions you can work with - if you do some quests for them), visiting cities (on the planet)\n\nBuilding a new space-ship so you can leave (which would be the end goal for Act or Chapter I)\n\nReturning either to the fight or to hunt the traitor :)\n\n...(so that's basically what I have)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: I want a game that combines base-building, base-defense and resource-mangegement with an RPG and elements of Assassin's Creed (movement and CQC-System) and Anthem (flight system!) etc. and a great story, characters and factions! Kind of like 'Battlezone' (Cold war vehicle combat with building etc. in space, from the 90's) with RPG-Mechanics (but more!)"

beozz4,Level design inside of a sphere,"I figured I'd share this gem &amp; or turd of an idea. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBasically, I'd like to eventually figure out how to put a camera inside a sphere, create an inverted gravity that pushes moveable objects (like the player) outward away from the center of the sphere.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn short, to create levels that are self contained inside of spheres.   I am thinking of top-down movement with the camera either midway between player and center of sphere, or the camera just centered, and rotating on it's 3 axis to follow the player as he moves around on the inside of the face of the sphere.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt seems like it could be a technical nightmare, because instead of just saying, hey when I press X, go up -- you'd always have a different direction based on where you were.   That is why it is probably a turd idea.  \n\nWhat do you guys think?"
bejptb,A parkour-style game where you are being hunted by an overwhelming force in the form of a monster,"This idea could be a small game or a single level mechanic in a game.\n\nThe concept for this idea is that the player is being hunted by a monster that cannot be killed - but not in the fashion like horror games. \n\nThe player is a soldier in some sort of environment that would lend well to parkour. After an opening cinematic where the player's team gets decimated to a man, and the player has asked for evacuation, they are told that they must get to a certain area at a certain time to get on the helicopter.  The problem is that the evacuation point is quite a distance away. \n\nThe player must run and hide from the monster, The monster is constantly hunting them down through sight, smell, and hearing. The player can hide, but only for a certain time before the monster catches up to them. Any other time, and they must be actively running from the monster. \n\nThe world is open and so there are potentially hundreds of routes to take to get to the evacuation point. The problem is that they must ensure to get to the evacuation point at the exact right time - if they get there and wait the monster will kill them while they are waiting. \n\nThe monster is slightly faster than the player, but performs parkour slightly slower. This means that the player cannot simply outrun the monster. To get away, they must lead the monster on a path that will slow it down and outmaneuver them. \n\nThere would be save points in certain places, but to avoid putting themselves in situations where they might only have seconds to get away, they need to plan ways to get there when they have a significant lead. This could be made more difficult by making the save points expendable - once the save point has been used it can never be used again in that save file. \n\nThere is no main map, just a minimap showing the direction of nearby save points and the distance to the evacuation point. There is no identifier for where the monster is. If the player wants to ascertain the location of the monster, they must do so visually or by stopping and listening for where it is. The monster would make a lot of noise, which would make it easy to locate. \n\nIt feels like this would be a game that makes the player run on adrenaline and expectation. It's definitely a horror game, but more one that works on suspense than outright scariness. \n\nI know it will probably never get made, but I love this idea so much."

bej46t,"A dating sim without anyone to date... so you feel forever alone. (hear me out, though)","So this is a satirical dating sim in which any girls you try to confess to will immediately and brutally shoot you down.\n\n### The unique dialogue system.\n\nThis game features a ""derail"" dialogue system in which you can steer the game's scripted conversations. After every line of dialogue, you can choose to continue the current conversation route if you like where it seems to be going, or you can instead try to change the subject and move to a different conversation route if you don't like where the current one is going. In either case, your character talks just as much as the other person so that it feels like an actual conversation rather than NPCs spewing lines at you. Conversations either end naturally or when you both run out of things to talk about.\n\nWhy is it like this? Because these girls suuuuuuuuck. They're designed to be cute but extremely one-dimensional. Your conversations with them are meant to make you want to end them early.\n\n**All** the girls in this game will reject you. You can try to reload your latest save to do things differently all you want, but no matter what you try, they will turn you down in the most heinous ways possible. The game keeps track of how often you reload and will subtly alter your character to look shlubbier the more you do it. These and other methods are used to dissuade the player from attempting confessions.\n\n### There's one saving grace, though:\n\nThere's one NPC that is written to be genuine, intriguing and three-dimensional... but she's the game's non-courtable shopkeeper NPC. You can't date or even confess to her. Still, her witty dialogue, expressive nature and interesting personal stories are enough to keep you coming back to talk to her even when you don't have anything to buy. At the start she is simply cordial, but as you continue to speak with each other she starts opening up more. Even your character starts revealing things he never does to the other girls.\n\nIn the end, if you continue this route, you'll get the ability to confess to her as well."
beiayh,A FPS horror game similar to outlast and amnesia.,"Still don't know how there barely are any games similar, a first person horror game with little to no weapons, no map.

be836d,A fighting game idea i had,"I thought of an old 8 bit fighting game for youtubers it will start off with the gamer youtube channels. as the time goes on it will be updated with how tos, makeup, podcasts ect. depending on how their channels work and how they mix. It will start off with top ten or so influential channels. \n\n To help with visualization think of it as a mix of mortal kombat with a story mode similar to twisted metal. \nExample. Game theory mattpat or steph would be interchangeable characters mostly mirrored. but instead of the same special they will have a characters (i hate when different characters are mirrored to the point of their specials) for instance mattpat would have theorist fist either as a special or a charge move sreph would have something different. what that is not to sure im going to think it will have something similar to a mothers instinct due to the story mode idea. Now story mode for them would be similar and as i said earlier it would be similar to twisted metal if mattpat is chosen its steph and their kid taken and in mortal kombat fashion forced to fight till either get to the final boss and save their family. Another example felix would fight his way up to be the biggest youtube channel not in a boastful way but to save it.\n  It would only have in game purchases by skipping the unlocking process or different skins. Each youtuber will have their own way of unlocking them still working on thoughts of unlocking them maybe instead of experience players are granted subs and you have to spend subs to unlock or a different criteria need to be met like beat stoeymode without dying. but i want someone like mattpat or jacksepticeye someone who has worked with a lot of YouTube channels to be first unlocked then work out from there. \n  Of course there will prebattle dialogue and it will change depending on the person fighting using ex from before if mattpat and steph are against each other they will mention something like they are forced to give it everything they got and they dont want to and their son.

be3gzn,Feed&gt;Infect," \n\nMy Game Idea:\n\nA zombie hoard game! Now I know you're thinking ""there's tons of zombie games out right now"". I'm not proposing a survival horror game. I'm proposing a game where you ARE the zombie!\n\nHere's how I would envision it:\n\nScene: The start of a reanimation virus outbreak (and being as the outbreak just started, widespread news of it is minimal). You are one of the first few to be turned. You start out as the ""slow walking"" zombie type, with limited actions at your disposal (mainly just drag your leg and bite). \n\nAs you start feeding and infecting citizens, the news spreads and panic arises. The more you feed, the stronger you get (gaining speed, some cognitive knowledge, etc..). Also, the more you feed/infect, the more chaotic the citizens get. Every time you feed, shortly thereafter your dinner becomes one of your infected hoard. More infected means less to feed on. If you're killed (by citizens, police/military, or other zombies), after a re-spawn timer you would take over one of the infected from your hoard. If your hoard is eradicated, it's game over for you.\n\nNow on a competition standpoint, the winner would be the hoard that is either biggest by the end of the match or the hoard that ends up killing/eradicating all other hoards. There could also be ""capture the flag"" type of game, where the goal is to capture citizen strongholds. You could also have one team be the zombies and the other be citizens. A beast vs. Man scenario.\n\nAs far as weapons/abilities, once you have infected enough citizens, you as the Alpha start mutating, and gaining new abilities (like spitting infected blood, zombie dogs, etc..). On the citizen side, as more are infected, widespread chaos ensues, which increases the threat factor. With a higher threat factor the citizens gain increased ways to fight off the hoard and defend themselves (i.e. starting off just screaming and running, then police, then local militia, then military. at the 5 minute left mark a nuke is called in).Each starting zombie player is a different strain of the virus (signified by a different color, symbol, etc..). If you kill an infected zombie of a different hoard, that zombie converts over to your hoard.\n\nThere could be temporary power-ups that not only affect you, but also your hoard, like give them increased speed for 30 seconds, or give them ""terror"" which makes other hoards run away in fear for 30 seconds.\n\nThe name of the game would be **Feed&gt;Infect**."
be2br5,First Person Shooter -- The Musical,"Title pretty much says it.\n\nAn irreverent take on FPS's. You're in the trench with your comrades fighting for your country, and suddenly they all launch into song about your present situation.\n\nLyrics and a few tonal shifts in the songs can fork in realtime based on your actions -- don't fire your gun the whole time? Maybe your comrades start singing about how they're not sure they trust you and they have to figure out what to do with you.\n\nClearly a big-budget production. Needs a great score, great performers, and most of all, still needs to be a great FPS. Collaboration between experienced theatre writers and a good game dev. Don't think this could work as an indie title, which is why I'm happily posting it here in case anyone with connections likes the idea.\n\nRun with it."

Each tool serving a purpose to the story as you unravel the mystery behind the disappearances. \n\n\nYou won’t only explore the town but you’ll travel through dreams and dimensions as well with the use of some of the objects/gadgets you’ll find. \n\nThere is a villain in the story, and they are a psychic who can can lift objects and control people with their mind.

bdzkgu,"You are a band of goblins and must stop a group of adventurers from completing their quests by scouting, ambushing, and trapping them along their way","The game starts by introducing a set of randomly generated adventurers (think maybe 4, warriors, rangers, wizards, paladins, etc.) then it shows your their quest. Their quest might be to deliver something to a town, or find an artifact in a cave, or defeat some evil character. After you see their quest, you are taken to the map, which shows their path.\n\nYour resources are goblins, supplies that you can collect by dedicating goblins to salvage on a turn, etc.. You can declare a certain number of goblins to do a task in a turn, such as attacking the adventurers, looting villages for more resources, or building traps.\n\nEach day, the adventurers advance on their path towards their goal, and you are shown updates; you are also shown updates to your own actions (+resources, trap completes, adventurer killed, etc.)\n\nThe game ends when you kill the group, or they beat you and finish their quest."

bdvnik,Another game idea looking for teammates.,"Hii people :)) I wanna make a game probably with unity+ Blender( I started using it)  The gameplay and the mechanic would be the same as this game  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwMeUr5Bjkc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwMeUr5Bjkc)  called Ghost Masters a real masterpiece from 2004.  It would be a 3d singleplayer story BR game.  What I mean behind br is the map control of the playable area. At the start you got a chance to attack after the time runs out the hunter"" becomes the hunted"" so in phase 2 you gotta defend yourself and hold a certain points in order to win the current episode/match. So this is what I come up with as  core elements. I haven't decided in characters but they probably will have spells.  I don't know if this to much I'm really looking forward to hear some feedback and we could break down things.. maybe 5-6 people max.\n\nIf you would add smth to this game feel free to do it.  \n\n\*I can show my portfolio site as reference and we could talk in Discord.

bdrbv3,Are these ideas offensive?,"You'd start the game out with a prologue about mobsters from the 80's set in vegas. Then you'd start the game with the main protagonist fighting against Italian mobsters from NYC set during the time period of late 90's to early 00's. Then it would move forward in the 00's with him dealing with the Russian mob.

bdq41p,Sense Roguelike - make use of senses to detect enemies and to protect from enemies,"I'm starting to prototype an idea of a strategic roguelike, where you make use of senses to detect enemies and to protect yourself from enemies\n\n  \n\n\nCore concepts:  \n\n\n* turn-based roguelike\n* Per turn you can move 1 tile or attack an enemy on a neighbor tile\n* You have 2 senses: sight and hearing, and you as the player determine which sense is active at any given moment (for both your hero and the enemies)\n* Senses have **two powers**: **to detect enemies** and **to protect the hero from enemies**  \n2 examples:\n   * If for the ""sight"" sense your hero has **90 to detect enemies** and **10 to protect from enemies**, that means that when the ""sight"" sense is the one active in the game:\n      * the hero can see enemies in a distance of 90 units forward from the hero's position\n      * the hero will not be seen by enemies in a radius of 10 units when he moves\n   * If for the ""hearing"" sense your hero has **55 to detect enemies** and **45 to protect from enemies**, that means that when the ""hearing"" sense is the one active in the game:\n      * the hero can hear enemies when they move in a radius of 55 units\n      * the hero will not be heard by enemies in a radius of 45 units when he moves  \n\n* in every turn, you see the Area of Effect of all enemies for the active sense, so you can decide what next move to make based on that information\n* when you kill an enemy you earn the units he has of the active sense\n* you can at any time change how the values for the active sense of the hero are distributed. For example, you can choose ""sight"" sense to have 100/0 (you see any enemy in 100 units but have no protection), 50/50, 60/40, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, basically, the challenges are:\n\n* choose the right sense to be active in a given moment, considering your hero's surroundings and the ""power"" the enemies have of the active sense\n* choose how to distribute the values **to detect enemies** and **to protect from enemies** for each sense. Do you max out the value to detect enemies so you can see or hear everything in a distance of 100 units but be defenseless? Or do you prefer to keep a balance between the two so you can see/hear but also be protected from being seen/heard?  \n\n\nThoughts?"

bdlfi0,"2d games of about 30 players on screen at once, cooperating to climb strangely shaped terrain by pulling and pushing near players, against some nonlinear gameplay rules where if you pull someone up in some cases you fall more than you pull them up, and other times you both rise","Its a vague idea in how theres many possible nonlinear ways it could be tuned, but in general you feel you are risking your 2d height to pull others up, swing around eachother, etc, to help others get higher in 2d, which many of them will in the next few seconds do the same for you, or you might let someone think you're about to grab them but instead let them fall to their death far below. In general I think games could benefit from deeper interaction between more players at once in the moment to moment interactions of more players at once, such as what 5 near players are doing affects all of eachother, instead of just pairs of near players such as one shoots at the other."

bdilaf,Sokoban type of game where your senses are your main powers,"I'm starting to prototype an idea of a strategy, Sokoban type of game.\n\nYou can find the details below.\n\n\nWhere do you see potential? Where you don't?\n\n\nAny feedback is appreciated.\n\nThanks!\n\n\n\n* sokoban type of game\n\n* turn-based\n\n* you have 4 senses (sight, hearing, smell for now, could add others as heat sensor). You can have 1 sense active at a time in the HUD\n\n* senses have two values: \n\n	- left value: how much effect in units (pixels, meters, whatever) you have with the sense from the position of the hero\n\n	- right value: how much units you can decrease NPCs sense effect\n\n	- Both values add up to 100. So if your sight is 100/0, you can see 100 units forward but cannot hide at all from enemies\n\n	- If your sight is 50/50, you can see 50 units forward and can ""hide"" in a 50 units radius. So, if an enemy has 100 of sight and you have 50 ""NPC sight decrease"" and you're 50 units or less away from him, he won't be able to detect you. But if you're 51 units or more away from him, he will detect you\n\n	- you can move units in the active sense from left (how much effect you can make with the sense) to right (how much you can decrease NPCs sense effect), in order to decrease the power of enemies' sense on you (at the expense of giving away a bit of your power with that sense), or viceversa (increase your power at the expense of decreasing how much you can ""hide"" from enemies with that sense)\n\n- when a sense is activated in the HUD, all the NPCs area of effect is shown for the player to know where he can move without being detected at all or being detected by the less number of enemies\n\n\n* in a turn you can:\n\n	- activate a new sense to see areas of effect for that sense\n\n	- move\n\n	- attack an enemy in a neighbor tile\n\n	- swap units in a sense from left to right or viceversa\n\n* when you kill an enemy you ""absorb"" his units of his senses and are added to your senses. Eg: if he has 55 of ""sight"", and you have 23 of sight, when you kill him you end up with 78 of sight"

You’re running through some sort of town trying to outgun them or try to sneak from them. You have to always get to the next “checkpoint room” in my dream when you got to the checkpoint room you’d have to destroy stuff (wooden crates, vases, etc.) to find more supplies. It’s up to you to find which checkpoint you wanna go to. You could hit all them in a linear fashion or you could go straight to the more “powerful” checkpoint rooms. The downside to this is that you have more and more cops coming after you. In most checkpoint rooms the resources are scarce. You’d find maybe a round of ammo and some bandages but in some checkpoint rooms you could find a new weapon or something. \n\n\n\nI don’t know.

bcov9f,Mass Effect/Avatar(Airbender)/Mercenaries Crossover,"I came up with an idea of a backstory for a video game and wanted to take it from there.\n\nThere is a perfect balance in the universe between the elements of ground, fire, water and air. Species would rise and fall as guardians of these elements. A long time ago, an ancient race and the guardians of the ground was wiped out. No one knows what caused it. This created a disturbance between the other guardian races. Eventually, the fire and air alien races formed an alliance and almost wiped out the water guardians. The water guardians escaped on a meteorite that travelled to the milky way system and landed on a planet called earth. This meteorite wiped out most life that was on the planet before it and caused a reboot for the planet. Legends would rise of mermaids and syrens, creatures of the deep as well as a lost City of Atlantis where this other species lived.\n\nTo this day, we know more about the far reaches of space than we do about the bottom of the ocean. Humanity rises and finds a way to travel to the deep depths of the oceans. They come across an ancient city that looks like nothing historians have ever seen before. They realise that this place is not an ancient city when the main protagonist finds a little mermaid girl, a child. When the protagonist goes up to either comfort or confront her, the main character is attacked by a merman. Humanity has discovered another intelligent race on earth, hiding at the bottom of the oceans. They tell our hero the legend of the guardian races and that they have been hiding here trying to survive before thriving once more and taking the fight to the other guardians.\n\nWhen our hero returns to the surface, we see an alien invasion from the air guardians that look like militarized locusts with wings. Our heroes cease is attacked by a boarding party, believing us to be water guardians but we fight them back. They intercepted our satellites and discovered reports that we had found a new species that described the water guardians. This alien invasion has nothing to do with humanity though. The air guardians are only flying over water and don't seem to care about us at all. I'm fact, when we contact the air guardians they tell us we can either help them kick this alien race off of our planet or stay out of their way. Which means we have a choice to make. Either we help the water guardians from being wiped out, we help the air guardians kicking another alien race off of our planet or we do nothing. Obviously we decide to help one. Whichever one you pick to help becomes your allies and the other race retreats from Earth as your enemies.\n\nThe allied race then discovers that humanity are in fact descendants from the guardians of ground which is now called earth because of the planet you live on. We have lived our lives being able to manipulate the ground around us to create houses, weapons, vehicles, medicine, education and created a society that can help the allied race to restore balance to the universe.\n\nThat's just the basic plot of the first mission. The aim of the game is to create peace between the four races and create balance in the universe between the elements. You make choices throughout the story, you have to keep every elemental race happy so you do missions for each of them, you can choose who is on your crew by starting off with humans and then having the choice to choose other alien races, you can flirt and have relationships with men and women, human or alien.\n\nI know this sounds like a big epic game and it probably is but there are ways where you could simplify this plot but keep the elemental aliens, balancing factions and making choices throughout the game."
bco1xl,Assault Lander,"This game will be a side view ""Lander"" game like the 70's Lunar Lander Game. The twist is you are playing as an armed and armored drop ship trying to get your troops to the planet's surface from an orbital troop carrier.

The player will be able to destroy enemy ground troops with the lander's cannons, but will not be able to get close enough to the air defenses to harm them.

Anyways, They could have a Pokemon game that uses a more basic version of smash Bros fighting mechanics. In theory they would be able to fight just like smash but only punch, kick, claw, or bite depending on the type of Pokemon it is. And for their PP moves it would be set to the up, down, left, right, special moves that you could change whenever they learned a new move. I mean they already added a mode in ultimate that gives you hp so it would be possible to somewhat replicate that. I know you would have to go based on lvl and type advantage you would lose more or less HP. I just think it would be cool for the over world to look kinda like let's go but the battles to be more ADVANCED now like smash but not heavily relying on combos. Honestly I've thought about this for years and still think it would be ingenuous for Nintendo to do this and it was what I was hoping would happen for the switch.\n\nTDLR POKEMON WITH SMASH FIGHTING INSTEAD OF TURNBASED.\n\nI really would like to hear anyone's thoughts or ideas about something similar or possibly even fan made stuff like this.

bh0074,Kill The Chef,"The setting is a kitchen. You play as a random small object in the kitchen, be it an oven, a piece of food, a cabinet, or even cutlery. These objects can move in specific ways, such as sliding or rolling if you’re a small object, and maybe only opening or closing if you’re something large like a cabinet or oven. \n\nThe goal of the game is to kill the chef in the kitchen. You *should* go about this stealthily, although the game wouldn’t just end if he spotted you. You, as the object in the kitchen, move around and use the environment, and your specific object qualities, to try to cleverly and quietly kill the chef. Maybe if you’re a tomato, you roll under his foot, and make him slip and crack his head on the corner of the countertop. If you’re an oven, maybe you slam the door to make him notice it and walk over, and then clamp shut on his head or something. \n\nThere will multiple people in one kitchen at a time, all trying to kill the chef without being noticed. I imagine teams of people cleverly working together to kill the chef, or it could be a competition between a few people.\n\n At the end, when he’s killed, the game is replayed on a security camera screen. The idea is that it’s a funny/creepy security tape of a chef being killed by kitchenware. \n\nWhat do you think?"

bgnx6y,"RPG, Maybe MD, Heavily Story Based with a Lot of Mystery","An RPG that would be in a fantasy setting, you would play as a pair of friends who've been wanderers for most of their young lives. They will be pulled into the plot slowly with things for you to find in the game, such as ciphers, strange abandoned places, etc. The story will get more ambiguous as you continue and you should be unsure of who you should trust, even your own characters.\n\nSome things I still need to fully work out are:\n\n-What sort of magic system there would be? I somewhat want magic and science as parts of the game, but I dont know how the system should work, or if it shouls be incorporated into a fightinf system at all.\n\n-Fighting system? I wanted a story based game, but you have to have SOME sort of fighting in these games usually, even things like Undertale's system. I don't know how the characters would be able to fight, one probably doesn't have weapons aside from maybe a pocket knife for safety, but the other does have magic.\n\n-I wanted originally for some sort of bigoted hate to certain groups, but I'm not sure what it would be. If Magic is common, it cant be hatred for Magic. The people in the world can be many species of monsters including full on animals and half-human characters. The player characters are a human-like character with deer features and a wizard cat, so idk how one or both would be hated.\n\n-I'm still not sure about a villain or ""villain"" and what everybody's motivations are in game. If anyone has an idea please help me qwq"
bgnjn2,Zombies Will Kill Your Family: A slightly unconventional tower defense/shooter for mobile,"The game is in portrait format. Your character is at the bottom of the screen, on a balcony, with a gun, overlooking a field which takes up the rest of the screen.\n\nAs with most tower defense games, there are building phases (""day""), alternating with waves of zombies (""night"").\n\nUnlike with most tower defense games, there are no gun turrets. All you can build are various kinds of obstacles to slow zombies down so you have time to shoot them.\n\nZombies pathfind around obstacles, but different kinds of zombies deal with different kinds obstacles differently.\n\nOnce I get underway, I want to expand on this, but just for starters, two kinds of obstacles: Fences and Torches, and two kinds of zombies: Undead and Infected.\n\nUndead will pathfind around torches if they can. If they can't find a path around your Torches, they'll stand there and moan until one opens up.\n\nUndead don't care about Fences. They won't try to pathfind around Fences, and if they run into one, they'll slowly bash through it.\n\nInfected don't care about Torches. They won't pathfind around Torches, and if they run into one, they'll quickly tear it down and keep going.\n\nInfected will try to pathfind around Fences, but if they can't, they'll bash through.\n\nI want to avoid making what I call a ""game for cats"", which is to say, a game that boils down to tapping fast-moving images on a touch screen, so I want to make shooting zombies a little more complicated.\n\nIf you just tap a target, you don't do much damage. To do more damage, you have to ""aim"", which means holding your finger on the target for a little while before releasing. Different weapons well have different minimum damage/maximum damage balances.\n\nFor instance, a shotgun will do relatively high damage with a quick tap, but not that much more if you take aim. A sniper rifle will do pathetic damage with a tap, but will one-shot most zombies if you aim long enough.\n\nWhen a zombie is bashing through a Fence, that will of course be a good time to shoot it. But if you keep taking advantage of that, you'll lose Fences.\n\nBecause the player's finger will inconveniently cover the target while aiming, I'll want to make a little window with crosshairs in the upper right corner of the screen that shows the area around where the player is touching.\n\nAre there any hurdles or fatal flaws with this design that I'm not noticing? Any ideas for how to expand on it?"
bglkb4,Revolution simulator strategic game,"I had idea about revolution simulator, you would choose country of your choice with specific political system, presidential republic, parlamentarian republic, constitutional monarchy, absolute monarchy, clerocracy, dictatorship and some other systems i came up and your task is to bring revolution\n\nCountries also differ in culture, religion, advantages and problems.\n\nProblem is, I dont really know how mechanics would work and strategy would differ between countries.\n\nSome countries could be taken down by medial campaign, some only by brute force. But we would need to offer all tools to our player. He would need to raise interesting characters, recruit people, choose his themes and spread thoughts and menage finance. To thoughts and themes are most hard to narrow down. I want player to choose his own path in revolution, but also to make crowd little bit self determinded. Player needs to understand problems of society and offer them solution but he should not only comfort to people, because than he can end up with totaly diferent system than he wanted, so it is also about finding how to communicate your ideas and make them cooperative. The hardest thing is that this is hard to develop as game play because you can hardly offer some preset thoughts to player with which he would be interested but you need some system to it so the thoughts and themes can affect the game and player can search what people need. \n\nTo add more realistic behavior to it, it can be multiplayer internet game, player join one of many worlds with rest of players, than players need to ally, spread thoughts and so on. There would still be AI controling mass of citizen, economy, government and so on, but players would play as one of many active citizens contributing to revolution, so player would gain followers from AI crowd but also from other players, it could even serve as interesting research tool for social and political scientist. Also character of player should be himself affected by situation of country, because if we can hardly make such gameplay that AI understands players thoughts and so AI crowd could barely react to them, we need to make players understand their needs and care about them in first place, which we could do by making players part of that community, but this is hard for order to so, we would have to simulate their whole life and this is too much.\n\nIt could even be, that once revolution is done, the game does not end. The players who won revolution are now responsible for government or the AI still controls it but does according to their ideology and analysis of their movement. So game can be really endless. People can get on top and down, the game could even react on real world with players who bring their outside thoughts to game world.\n\nDimmension of control\nRecruit of people and characters\nResearching on peoples problems, creating forums\nForming thoughts\nSpreading thoughts\nMedia\nFinance menagement\nOrganizing protests and riots\nOrganizing brute force"
bgjxxo,An open world game where you are given a grappling hook to complete missions,"The mechanics of the grappling hook would be pretty simple. Maybe you can break windows (either by shooting your grapple at them or smashing them with momentum) and do take downs by grappling into an enemy. I personally think that this game would do best with low-polygons. There would be no big story; maybe just a reason to why you are killing your enemies. Missions would not be too important, they would just give you more objectives to complete. I have no intention of creating this myself so do what you want with it/change it however you want."
bgjq8s,anyone got any idea for an android game,
bgii7h,How is it possible to combine all these game ideas into one?,"One idea I have is where your protagonist is basically a failed human experiment project that was given away to the government from his family that they agreed to his parents they would make their son super enhanced but is now prematurely age accelerating but has the ability of cerebral mind hacking the bodies of NPC's and can see into the future for 5 seconds.\n\nAnother idea is a super soldier out for revenge on gangsters and criminals responsible for the death of his family like wife and kid maybe and he has this ability where he can go into a rage mode from the drugs inside his system but needs to keep staying on them to survive.\n\nAnother idea is an amnesia game where the player is in 1st person and can't remember who they were or what they were experimented by but they have the ability to use telekinesis and can accelerate with incredible speed with melee combat combined with firearms and gun fu.\n\nAnother is the protagonist being able to manipulate animals that assist them like wolves, birds and so on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow can I combine all these ideas into one project and one story?"
bghulu,Robot pokemon game with building of robots,"So gameplay is like old pokemon games for gameboy but instead of pokemon, you collect robots, you can dismantle robots and use their parts to build new robots, combine robots or improve them. The building of robots could be simmilar to minecraft building in inventary. The game takes place in abandonded factory or city, it looks little bit postapocalyptic or at least rusty, and there also other players, trainers, in this game concurent scavengers who will fight with you. Your main goal is not to scavenge but to defeat main robot boss but in order to succed you need to scavenge, build and fight robots and other scavengers to gain power.\n\nYour robots would need energy, computer chip, transportation and weapons. all parts can get broken in fight and you need to repair them.\n\nSo the robots from factory turned against human and expel them from city, there are many scavengers and survivors who gain resources from fighting minor robots and scavenging their parts and reprograming them as their pets, you are human sent to turn out main robot and in order to do, you do same as scavengers. \n\nGraphic can be simmilar to gameboy games."
bghhdi,Ragnarok - An openworld game influenced by norse mythology.,"So I recently have gotten really into north mythology, and realized that except for the obvious AAA title God of War, there is not a lot of games that uses the setting of norse mythology. I have been thinking of an open world story driven game, which takes you through the nine different worlds of norse myths, and tells the stories about the gods and other mythical beings.  I threw together a concept piece in unity for you to get a better understanding of the artstyle.  [https://imgur.com/zBWSFuO](https://imgur.com/zBWSFuO)  The assets aren't mine, but I can see how a low polygon artstyle with a more dark setting could be a good fit for the game."
bghbsl,Prehistoric fantasy setting,"Dont know if this is done, but it seems to me that this is pretty unusual setting worth exploring. I have no idea for gameplay now, so my post is mainly about setting. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe have plenty of fantasy games from medieval and ancient setting, but not much from prehistory.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow you may find this setting boring, but really it is fascinating as everything seemed magic back then.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou can have shamans instead of wizards, beasts, ghosts and deamons from forrest. I once read about felline predator who was specialized on hunting people, it had jaws specially shapen to grab peoples heads and it was attacking when people where sleeping. Also there was more species of human back then, neandrthalis, cromagnon and so on, they could be like trolls and elvens and heck you even could have some strange mighty tall figures, affecting story... They could really be aliens or timetraveling human from future, in black body suit but with transparent body. But i dont really know if i want this sc-fi ellement, maybe rather just nature, magic and mystery."
bggog4,"There are no new weapons or armor to find out or upgrade, but versatility is given by the possibility of choosing from a list of characters which are enemies you've killed","2d realtime hack and slash roguelike. You have 4 slots for characters. The first slot is for your main character, the other 3 for enemies you kill. \n\nYour main character cannot be replaced, but the others are replaced in a fifo style (first-in, first-out) automatically with every enemy you kill. You can tap 1 to 4 at any time to choose with which character to play with. \nYou cannot add any enemy you kill to the list at any time but you rather have to ""unlock"" enemies that you can add as you progress, to add some sense of achievement to it.\n\nAlso, you can pick up cards/runes that are one-time upgrades/boosts/spells that remain active for a certain time and then disappear. \n\nSince characters have different advantages/disadvantages, you have to choose carefully when to make use of a certain card.\nFor instance, you may kill an enemy that's very powerful but blind. So you may want to use the ""Sight enhance x2"" card and you'll be a badass player since you hit hard and now you can see, until your character is replaced or the card expires. Using that card on some other character though, would be useless, so you have to be careful not to waste opportunities with cards."
bgfmen,"Something more abstract, but necessary for making an idea really good",
bgbuq5,'Generations' - A Space Exploration &amp; City Management,"Core concept: \n\nEarth's resources has been consumed, humans are exploring into the stars. Generation ships have been developed, hundreds built, where only a few thousand people are provided passes per ship. You command one, as you leave Earth behind your mission is to guide the generation ship with FTL Engines and travel to distant worlds, gathering resources from planets, asteroids, and moons. Your goal is to find the next Earth to call home, but ultimately your people must survive before they get there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGame play concepts:\n\nA lot of the concepts I've just came up with tonight, but I've kind of started to realize it's very much like Frost Punk in space.\n\nCity Management; primarily keeping hope up, space is dark and distant. Most citizens know they won't make it to the next Earth, however keeping the hope for one generation to eventually make it is going to take work. Resource management, health management, and production to maintain the ship.\n\nReal Estate: There's only so much space available on the ship, managing the real estate to provide food, housing, and industry is another primary task to create a balance for your population.\n\nResources: Resources like metals, water, and plant life can change the way your game develops. You can mine stray asteroids, or asteroid clusters for metals to make repairs, build technology, and general well being of citizens. Water is a must, you have water purification systems however they have to be maintained, tanks emptied, etc. Finding water worlds is not rare but not common either. Plants and other things, plants help recirculate oxygen, but plants can take over the arboretum, spread infestations, etc. Animals for fresh food meats, and pets, they can also carry diseases and cause plagues.\n\nSpace Exploration: Procedural generated galaxy allows you to chart the stars, do scanning missions with scientists to try and find the next place to visit. You have to use fuel to make another jump to the next system, but allows you to be able to find new resources that will help your city thrive. Not all systems have all the resources you need, and your ship may end up stranded if you don't plan and take your time.\n\nSciences and Tech Trees: Tech trees could be maintained with core scientist compliments, as your scientists work they figure out how to better manage resources. Keep the water purifiers running longer, synthesize foods, use exotic materials for new technology. (For example; a plant species discovered on a planet could be found to be a better water filter than current tech.)\n\nLaws and additional mechanics: Some additional mechanics can be added like a law system, in order to keep peace, or pacify your people. Many people will end up hopeless and feel there is no meaning, so they take to crime to get that they want. As food and water becomes scarce, riots may start and people will die, proper policing and control of the population may be needed to maintain order. (Population control such as one child per family, to prevent over population...)\n\nWork and Jobs system: Many people need work, so maintaining the generation ship will take up a lot of the population, however additional industries can be built to support building of things. Commercial enterprises stood up to handle economic resources.\n\nGoverning types: Allow capitalism or be completely socialist, or find an equal balance in between. This can be added to the laws and other mechanics. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just thought of all this tonight trying to search for a new game on steam, and ending up empty handed. I would love to see someone use this idea to make something awesome. Please credit me, and I'll also be happy to provide additional concepts and guidance on the game as it's being built."
bgaal9,Maze Runner Fallout-like RPG,"First game is an extended version of The Kill Order, with an open world and an elongated main story, will be about 30+ hours \n\nSecond game covers all of Thomas’s story (1-3), about 50 hours.  Has a 10-hour Fever Code expansion that plays before the main game if installed (it affects the main game)\n\nThe actions Mark, Thomas, and Newt will have various impacts on the story as a whole\n\nGames will be closer to the books than the movies, and will be even more mature, taking cues from New Vegas and the original Fallouts"
bg9bgo,Undertale Remake by CD Projekt Red/Obsidian,"Similar to original game, but with 3 more areas: a forest area, sky area, and a city before Asgore’s castle\n\nEach area is roughly the size of a quarter of New Vegas’s map, with the city before Asgore’s castle being the size of Novigrad\n\nEach area will have about 5-6 hours of main quest stuff and 3-4 hours of side quests\n\nLike any CDPR game, side quests affect the main quest,\n\nCombat system will have 2 options\n1: Traditional system with added mechanics \n2: ATB based action system\n\nFrisk will have dialogue options that can lead to different things\n\nRomance options will be present (No sex for obvious reasons)\n\nMajor characters will have more side quests that affect them. Getting their respect allows them to accompany you with different perks (Traveling with Undyne calls off all Royal Guard attacks)\n\nGenocide Run will have more characters standing their ground.\n\n\nGame will have 2 expansions:\n\n1: The Man Who Speaks With Hands (About 10 hours)\n\n2: Universal Dilemma (Affects each next run you play, cycles through various fan made AUs\n\nRPG mechanics are more fleshed out, with various perks and abilities."

bg5ybf,Horror game concept for a college project,"I wanted to focus my game idea around mental health. This was to raise awareness for it and I thought it wasn’t shown enough in the gaming community. The story is of the horror genre and follows a man who had a horrible upbringing, full of abuse and neglect. Due to this he had major trust issues, later on in life he bagged himself a good job and was on high pay. He had one friend that didn’t understand what he was going through. He felt the alone though due to his trust issues. This lead to depression and he tried to take his own life via hanging, his “friend” finds him and takes him down just before death, but the lack of oxygen to the brain put him in a coma. In the coma he is put in an endless corridor (PT inspired). There is a lot of doors, in each room there is a certain memory or fear that he has to overcome, once he overcomes them all he will be able to escape his coma. \n\nI was wondering if anyone had any suggestions or feedback on my idea so I could improve it. I also wanted opinions on if the mental health aspect was actually shown in the game and was apparent enough for it to create awareness for the issue. Thanks"
bg3wrw,My Idea. Share your thoughts please :),"I'm not much of a programmer or artist. I've really wanted to make this game for a long time. I guess the only thing that stops me is my Art skills and knowing it will look like shit. Anyway here's my idea. If someone wants to steal it and make it into a game then at least invite me to contribute on the project.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDelve Into Darkness\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHack N' Slash, Cooperative, Rogue-Like.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThink diablo-like but with a WASD control scheme similar to Battlerite (underappreciated competitive game) and some Dead Cells flair mixed in. The game would be class based with some trinity elements. 1-5 player cooperative. There would be a Lobby town everyone started in where you would have to choose a class and initial provisions. In town you would find a group and then enter the dungeon. The dungeon would be your typical dungeon where the layout is procedurally  generated to an extent and the enemies would get harder as you progressed. Each enemy would have a combat pattern that would need to be learned to be successful. Every floor would have at least 1 elite enemy and every 3rd floor would have a mini-boss that you would have to defeat before progressing. There would be your typical RNG loot and certain classes could use certain weapon types making picking a diverse group a benefit. Leveling up would provide stat and skill points so you can focus on a different build on different delves.

I'll go out there and do whatever it takes"". With nothing but a bulletproof vest and a pistol, it's time for you to take back the world.\n\nGameplay: The game is separated into two halves. The first half, it's sort of like a visual novel or even a dating game. Then, in the second half, it basically becomes post apocalyptic DOOM. \n\nAlso, maybe there's an anime art style.\n\nI can't think of a name."

bfk7fl,A Humans v.s. Zombies Rogulike where you can play as the zombies or survivors.,"This is kind of a culmination of many game ideas I've had, but I think this might actually be good.\n\nThe game can be played singleplayer or online. In singleplayer mode, anything another player could do is replaced with AI.\n\nBefore joining a game, the player picks a team to play on: Either Dead or Alive. The ""Dead"" team is Zombies, and the ""Alive"" team is Humans. The player count on each team is mostly in the air, but I'm thinking 16 players per team. If the player is on the Dead team, they get to choose from various mutations for their loadout, and control a small (5-10) swarm of Zombies with those mutations. On the other hand, if the player picks the ""Alive"" team, they choose a loadout from a selection of items they have.\n\nThe game takes place on a randomly generated map (probably a city, but other themes like a countryside could be options). Spawn points are also random. The goal is for the ""Alive"" team to purge as many Zombies as possible and get to the extraction point, whereas the goal for the ""Dead"" team is to turn as many ""Alive"" players as possible.\n\nEvery Zombie kill grants a ""Mutation Point,"" which can be used to buy mutations, and each Human kill grants ""Caps,"" which can be used to buy more items. If you're playing on the ""Dead"" team and your whole horde gets killed, you are removed from the game and lose all of your equipped mutations. If you're playing on the ""Alive"" team and get killed by a Zombie, your zombified corpse gets added to the horde that killed you, and if you're killed by something else (e.g. an explosion) your corpse just turns into a wandering Zombie. In both cases, you lose all the items you were carrying.\n\nThe win condition for the ""Dead"" team is when all of the players have been killed. The win condition for the ""Alive"" team is when all of the Zombies have been killed. \n\nIf all the ""Alive"" players get to the extraction point, the ""Dead"" team gets an ""extraction"" state - neither a win or loss, but the rewards aren't as good as if you won, and the punishment isn't as bad because you didn't die. When an ""Alive"" player extracts, they also get the ""extraction"" state."

bfe1v9,DMC meets Risk of Rain,"So I've been playing the hell out of Risk of Rain 2.  As a developer there's a lot about it that gets my creative juices flowing, and here's what I've been thinking about lately. \n\n\nIt's a game set loosely in ancient Greece, and you play as a hoplite/Spartan type character.  It's a character action game, so you have diverse combos, and the ability to quickly swap between using your hoplon (large bronze round shield), gladius and spear.  Think DMC or Bayonetta (or my favorite, Ninja Gaiden) \n\n\nThe game would start with some procedurally generated terrain - probably made with perlin noise multiplied by some hand-drawn (randomly selected) height maps that either set it up as a river valley, mountains, etc.  Scattered across this would be some hand-made objects like large rock formations and man-made structures. \n\n\nAlso scattered about would be shrines to the gods.  As the player spawns, enemies (based on the rich variety of a mythical Greek monsters) spawn in near their location.  Fighting these enemies grants favor to the gods, which unlocks the nearest shrine to the player.  Fighting more stylishly (higher combo counts, variety of attacks) grants more favor, unlocking them faster. Unlocking these shrines would probably reward the player in some way (new moves? Items?), and also unlocking a set number would then open the map's main objective, the temple. \n\n\nInside the temple is a Greek God, fighting a Titan. The longer the player takes to unlock the shrines, the more health the God loses to the Titan, and the harder the Titan will be.  The Titan will use large AoE style attacks, so even when fighting alongside the God, the player still has to evade its attacks.  However, the God will periodically grapple the titan, allowing a window of attack opportunity. \n\n\nDefeating the Titan leaves the God weakened (if it survived at all) and opens the level exit.  The player may proceed, or challenge the God. Killing the God will grant a reward, and switch the run from ""Honor the Gods"" mode to ""Defile the Gods"".  This means the player is now aligned with the titans, and instead of gaining favor when slaying enemies, they instead defile the shrines with the enemies blood. Likewise they fight alongside the titan against the God.  \n\n\nIf, after defeating the God, they challenge the weakened titan, they will enable Narcissus mode.  In this mode, defeating enemies will randomly spawn rewards, but the God and Titan will both now spawn in the level and make their way to attack the player. Defeating both stops the spawning of enemies, so unlimited farming isn't an option. \n\n\nI'd probably lean more in the direction of making the combat rich and enjoyable over supporting a massive variety of builds and item synergies.  Perhaps even with moves unlocking as rewards, and staying unlocked between runs. Games like DMC are already incredibly repayable even with everything unlocked, so the roguelike nature of the game is more of a framework to allow less repetition in replays, rather than to make each playthrough play differently. "

I thought it would be funny if my ""Frogger"" arcade user made the user/person grading the project feel in some way. Does anyone have any ideas of some sad/fulfilling storylines that would work for a multi-level ""Frogger"" type game?\n\nIdeas I have thought of so far:\n\n\-A game where with each level your character sprite changes to be older and the obstacles you dodge are relevant parts of your life, ending with you as an old man reaching the grave. (So existential I find it pretty funny).\n\n\-A game where you are a ghost trying to follow a living loved one. (Would be very difficult as I wouldn't be able to have cut scenes, etc.)\n\nAlso, I need to have this finished in about a week and a half, so I was planning on just having it be about 5 levels max with very very simple mechanics.

beu04e,20 or so texts to a friend that turned into me dreaming about a my idea for a fortnite/Battle Royale alternative,     Perhaps you bang two rocks together and everything caught within the sound waves emanating from where those rocks collided dies?   But it takes thousands of years for those sound waves to leave? Imagine you could be a squirrel and walk around there now but in 10 years you could walk in the same spot and be vaporized. \nJust like an unseen death field. A force field of death. Like you know how the storm closes in on you on fortnite? What did you put the same thing but it came out in the form of a circle spreading outward slowly? so you force all of the players to have to walk around in a ring as opposed to a small circle? \nWhat if death started from the center of the map and everyone had to run from it? \nYou could have multiple spots being hit so that people had to run in a tizzy to survive the storm.You would never know which areas would be safe. No camping. Now what if you took it and had every player that dies emanate a circle of Death from their corpse on the map? \nIt would turn fortnite into a very different game. You would have to watch where you killed people. You could cut yourself off from guns and supplies if you weren't careful. And you could use it to cut off large groups of people from getting out alive. It no longer becomes a battle royale. It might force people to work together to survive. And in the grand scheme of things they would have to kill each other anyway. Oh my gosh this sounds great. Forcing individuals to band together to fight against one another and in the end ultimately having to kill each other anyway. So you have the storm explode out of each players corpse slowly. The storm plagues the area as a shadowy black void forever spreading. That way it's impossible to see through it. But if need be you can attempt to traverse the storm to help out players in need. Maybe you could fill the void with custom animations. DLC content mwahaha!! Each player could have a different void Spreading from their corpse. Find the dog tags of your Dead homie in the void and earn an extra life. The great part would be how the game starts. You would either have to be the first person to kill another player or have someone end up dead some other way. depending upon whether the first death is Murder or suicide changes the values of the game mechanics. \nPerhaps the first killer gets a special perk. Their name above their head but no body because they have torn it into pieces with random massive hitboxes of their skin stretched along the playing field. Maybe you could have the first victim have sight of the entire map including seeing thru the shrouds from beyond the grave. That way it's like the first killer gets their soul torn into pieces for being evil and the first victim gets too haunt them. It makes it so that the first death can help other players cheat in a way but at the same time makes it really difficult to kill the first killer. But at the same time not having a body and having a spread-out hitbox makes it somewhat difficult to kill the first killer. So in a way it's a perk yet a nerf. The first killer gets ripped to pieces but the victim get full sight restored. You could have the first death be a flying camera. Etc etc feel free to build on to my idea..\n\n//Sorry for the crap editing and lack of paragraphs//

The automatical control can be set to follow certain battle tactics according to your desire which can be also changed before every battle, AI could learn from your preffered battle style and your characters could grow better with cooperation in automatic mode longer you have them in team and more trained they are.

biy0e0,What's wrong with my idea of a crime action game being taken as offensive?,"I promised my project would be more of a cyberpunk action game set with a concrete jungle atmosphere but I'm planning on starting it out as a timeline of events as separate games, first a crime influence set in the 70's and 80's where the main character would be fighting against the Italian mob set in Vegas and maybe also set in Chicago or Pennsylvania but vegas would be the main focus. The protagonist would not be a mobster but a well trained soldier that was a Vietnam vet and possibly a former hitman and he's enemies with the mob. Why have I been told this would be offensive or uncreative and that it would be better to just having it set in a cyberpunk future with futuristic mobsters? I don't plan to abandon the ideas of a cyberpunk setting but I want to start out this epic storyline with the criminals of the 70's or 80's. I think the issue is the setting of technology at the time was less advanced and the NPC's would look old fashioned? I really like the old setting to start out first but it seems like it would not grab much attention because for some reason it does;t sound exciting to others? \n\nwhat do some of you think? I think playing as a badass Vietnam vet soldier fighting mobsters and criminals in the 70's or even 80's would have a cool retro style to it. Anyone agree?"
bix69a,A game where manage dice superstitions,"I’m an avid board game lover, and something many board game lovers know about is dice superstitions. Not many people actually believe in them, but almost everyone talks about them at least jokingly. For example, if you roll high, the odds of you continuing to roll high in the future significantly decrease. Many dice have a certain number of good rolls and bad rolls for each session, so if you roll recklessly you may waste the good ones. Some people have antagonistic dice who conspire against them, others have special rituals to increase the odds of a good roll. \n\nThis sounds a lot like a resource management game to me. I figured it would be a fun video game. \n\nThis game would be centered around playing a dice game. The exact nature of the dice game isn’t all that important, but what is important is the dice themselves. Each die has specific stats and abilities, similar to items from a Diablo game, and players must manage their collection of dice to maximize their odds in the dice game. \n\nThe stats for these dice may include things such as how likely it is to roll a specific number, special effects on other dice if rolled a certain way, or a higher/lower chance to betray you during a good streak. You’ll be able to look at all these stats in your inventory, as well as pick specific dice to bring with you into the game. They’ll probably also come in special colors and particle effects to make them that much more fun. \n\nDuring the actual game, you’ve got to manage your “team” of dice accordingly. If one die seems to be getting tired or running out of good karma, you might want to bench it in favor of another one. You may have special items or one-time abilities you can use to enhance your own dice or jinx others’. Maybe you can steal another player’s odds of rolling a 4, or prevent your dice from rolling multiples, or other things to tip the RNG in your favor.\n\nIt’d be a fun mix of strategy and push-your-luck gameplay, combined with a loot collection and loadout building metagame. Having a system to trade dice and abilities would also add to the fun of it, especially if the dice evolve to betray you or otherwise outmoded. There are a lot of possibilities for this, and I think it could prove to be a very fun game if executed properly."

Maybe some whales during a part of their migration. \n\nAnother intresting part would be that during winter the top of the water froze, so you had to wait until it melted or you could mine through straight to the top.\n\n\nHope i was understandable and sorry for any spelling problems, cause english is not my first language."

Civilization is on the mend and is finally beginning to rebuild their broken world.  \n\n\nYou, Player, working as a Civil Engineer under the new US Federal Government, have been ordained with the authority to redevelop a portion of eastern Virginia located around the historically significant Jamestown (including abbreviated versions of Williamsburg and Richmond) Note: I didn't want to set it in Virginia since FO76 is set in West Virginia... but it fits with the theme too well.  \n\n\nYou will be tasked with everything from planning the demolition of ruins, relocation of settlers and refugees, planning and rebuilding settlements, homesteads, commercial sectors and general infrastructure, as well as plotting for trade routes and homeland defense. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe game is part Sim City, part Warcraft, part Civilization, with a healthy mix of other ideas from similar games.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Resources**\n\nTo begin rebuilding, you need resources and empty land. This can be a twofold operation: Send lumberjacks to a cluster of trees to clear the land as well as add to your lumber supply. Lumber is a vital material for most construction projects, but can also be immediately used to erect temporary housing for displaced settlers and refugees. Send rock breakers to a quarry to build your concrete supply to create roads and sidewalks. Concrete is also involved in many other construction projects. Send demolition crews to ruined neighborhoods to demolish houses and buildings to increase scrap metal supply. Scrap metal can be smelted, and the reforged steel can be used to facilitate creation of brand new buildings, infrastructure, and/or military hardware. So on and so forth - you get the idea. You'll need to use the collected materials build facilities and equipment to process the materials in order to make better equipment for collecting the materials which increases yield. You'll also need to build important facilities fairly early such as water treatment, power plants, sewage etc and lay electrical grids and piping much in the way you'd do with Sim City.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Rebuilding**\n\nEvery city has certain needs. Food, water, power, education, recreation, jobs, etc. You will need to take the stepping stone approach to creating a thriving city by first providing adequate shelter and resources for settlers and refugees of the wasteland, then providing ways for them to contribute to the rebirth of their society by giving them jobs - either in construction, defense, planning, education, etc.. you'll need to provide services like education for future generations to be more skilled and efficient at their tasks, recreation to maintain a reasonable level of civil harmony (all work and no play leads to civil unrest which can lead to people leaving the city which reduces tax revenue, or rioting which leads to destruction if infrastructure, etc). You can't have it all at once so you'll need to carefully choose how to allocate resources to slowly increase across all fronts. At some point, if you've planned your city well, growth will be exponential as the assets you've put in place will start to function as a closed circuit, requiring less and less of your input except in the event of disaster or emergency.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Trade and Defense**\n\nAlthough you won't be ""boots on the ground"" involved in trade or defense, you will have oversight of these areas. Supplying your military with weapons and vehicles increases protection from whatever raider factions remain in the wasteland. Dispatching hunting parties to clear out mutant nests will reduce the threat of the odd mutant rampage (eventually the mutant population will be entirely eliminated). Establishing trade agreements with other cities in relative proximity will be mutually beneficial, but that comes with the need to haggle for a good deal lest you be taken advantage of, or worse, anger another city to the point they want to attack you. You won't have direct RTS style control over your military or trade caravans, but you can make decisions that impact their actions. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Disaster**\n\nAlthough the radiation has dropped to the point that the majority of the land is safely inhabitable, there are still threats in the world. Unexploded ordinance, sometimes of the nuclear variety, is still hidden throughout the land - sometimes in bunkers/buildings, sometimes in the wild. A wise Player will designate cleanup crews to explore the land and discover these dangers before a mishap occurs. Virtually every mutant species is nearly extinct, but this is also causing the remaining populations to act more desperately, straying into populated areas when they used to avoid them. You will occasionally have to stop what you're doing to protect your citizens from a mutant attack - be it a Deathclaw, a pack of Molerats, or anything else. You may also encounter the occasional Raid by insubordinate wasteland factions. They will storm into the city in large groups, smashing windows and stealing whatever they can. They're very violent and make no concessions for preserving human life, so you will need to respond swiftly in order to protect your citizens and your city. Additionally, poorly built infrastructure in the early game (when your workers are unskilled and uneducated and the materials are of poor quality) will sometimes result in gas or water line ruptures, building collapses, bridge failures and other issues. On top of all that is the potential for natural disasters. Virginia is susceptible to Hurricanes, Tornadoes, flooding, winter storms and heat waves. All of which you will need to prepare for. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Long Game**  \nYou will start in a smaller area of Jamestown and Williamsburg, and expand to Newport News and Richmond and their outlying areas.\n\n  \nAs mentioned, at some point your cities, if designed well, will become sort of automation requiring little input from yourself. This is the end game, essentially, but of course you can speed up the simulation which will allow you to jump straight to disasters or other issues that will occur naturally.   \n\n\n**Game Modes**  \n*Minimalist-* For those who just want to focus on rebuilding. Resources are more plentiful, frequency and severity of disasters is reduced (federal financial aid is also available if requested), and trading/defense is simplified.\n\n*Moderate-* For those who want the full experience but aren't actually a real life city planner and therefore need a little bit of hand-holding or assistance - all features are enabled, but the game will adjust naturally occurring events based on your experience so far - in other words, if you're struggling in the aftermath of a destructive storm, it will delay future disasters until you're back on the upswing at least. Trading/defense will require your oversight.\n\n*Masochist-* For those who want as much of a challenge as possible. Everything is on the table here. Disasters will occur either at random times or when they are the logical conclusion of what is happening in your game. Disasters can also stack - for instance, a city-wide power outage is a great time for Raiders to attack. Trading/Defense will not only require your oversight, but also active management. \n\n*Armageddon-* This is basically a mode to see how long you can keep a pre-built city alive against an onslaught of disasters. \n\n*Free Mode-* This mode exists for those who just want to rebuild cities without the management aspect. This is basically Minecraft's Creative Mode. Resources are infinite. Infrastructure can be instantly upgraded. Disasters are off by default but can be triggered manually. Failure states are disabled, the game will continue as long as you wish. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've got a lot more in mind for this but I should probably leave it here for now."
biq5yj,Serious question,if I were to take an idea from here and make it into a functional game. And then published it. And made some revenue out of the game. Is there a possibility of ending in legal issues?\n\nAnd the other way around. If someone stole my idea and made a huge profit would it be possible to claim  it in a courtroom?

binq0i,Text based horror game ideas?,"I've been thinking a lot about different aspects of horror and how could I implement them in a text/photo based game. Anyone here that has some sort of insight? There's so many different ways to go for it and I'm definitely looking to catch the real feeling of being scared/paranoid, etc without the commonly used jumpscares which at least in my opinion often ruin the scary experience. So, any ideas?"
biknbj,A game where you are the BBEG,"Basically you start out killing amateur adventurers and taking their gear, and as you make more of a name for yourself more skilled adventurers show up. Maybe you even have to fend off dragons if you save up too much gold or things like that. You also amass better gear as time goes on and can invest in hired help and maybe improve your dungeon, but as you gain more followers you’re also at greater risk of conspiracies and people sneaking and stuff. It would basically be a mix of a tower-defense game and a (turn-based?) RPG. Maybe there would even be a mode where other players would have characters they use to try to break into your dungeon and kill you."
biifbo,Sandbox Automation Tycoon. (Not a puzzle game.),"This may have been done before but simpler, but here's the idea. You have a (3D) area where you can place items down. There are four different types of items, and many different tiers. The three types are mines, conveyors, upgraders, and furnaces. Mines drop ores at different rates, of different sizes, and different values. Conveyors transport these ores with different speeds, levels of stability, and directions. Upgraders are parts that ores can go through and they increase the value. There are three types of upgraders, money adders, money multipliers, and special effecters. They do what they say. Furnaces are the final destination of ores. They convert the ores into money at different rates. A very weak furnace would process ores at half value, while a very strong one would process them at 50x their value. You buy these parts with said money. Better parts require more money, and research. (Will get into research later.)  \n\n\nLike every other tycoon game, this game has a prestige system. Once you reach a high enough amount of money, you can reset. Possibly around the quadrillions. Once you prestige, you lose all the items you bought with money and get back your starter items, but you have one new item. This item is a high level prestige item, and it is better than most shop items. An example would be a prestige item that triples the ore value, but can be used only once. Prestige prices would go up semi-linearly to keep the game balanced. As you prestige more, the pool of items that can be drawn will increase in size. The new items will be better and/or have more creative effects.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nResearch is important early on. Research unlocks different and better shop items you can place down. You gain research by putting ores in furnaces at different rates.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExtra Notes: This is an incremental game, not an idle game. You have to semi-actively play to progress.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: 3D Sandbox tycoon game with many items about automation and getting so much money you would need scientific notation to write it."
bihs3z,Revamp of Pokemon combat? (Ideas wanted!),"I played the Pokemon handheld games growing up, and they were so good. The recent generations have left me wanting more though. I'm working on a game world that has creatures that can be captured and trained, and have elemental abilities. There is a lot of detail in the mechanism for how the creatures grow and change, and some of that is relevant to this discussion. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat I don't have is an idea of how to make combat more interesting. What I want to improve is the predictability, as well as the fun and challenge. If a Water type mon battles a Fire type, we all know who is going to win, 95 times out of 100, since Pokemon mostly learn moves tied into their type. I would like a combat system (that still uses type effectiveness) that has closer to an 80/20 split for a poor type match up. I do not want to make battles much much longer than they are in the Pokemon games. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you guys could improve Pokemon battles, what would you change? Throw away the turn-based system entirely, and go with a more Pokemon Go style? Or keep the speed stat, but have an action bar charge up like in Final Fantasy games? Maybe there isn't a catalogue of moves, but instead more generic Attack, Defend moves, and ways of combining the elemental abilities a creature has (contrast with Pokemon where a creature learns Tackle that has predefined Power, Type, Accuracy, etc.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe relevant difference in my world that deviates from Pokemon is the typing of a creature. In Pokemon a creature has 1 or at most 2 types, and there is a fixed number of unique Pokemon. In my world instead, there are a number of elements, each one represented by a pure being of that element (somewhere). The pure beings breed, and produce halfbreeds that are 50% of each of their parent's element. These creatures breed, and so on. A typical wild creature that an adventurer encounters might have at most 12 or 15% purity in an element, and the rest of its Elemental Makeup might be 1-8% of each of a dozen different elements, according to its heritage. There is no unique creature like a Pikachu that is Electric type... just an elemental being defined by its Elemental Makeup, and its Purity. This way, most creatures have bits and pieces of many elements, so their battle moves could draw from a wider variety of types."
bihejh,Mythic Card Wars Game,"A game with cards that when used summon the character and you can make them attack or make them save points to do a bigger attack similar to Jurassic World the game and Mkx mobile. The visuals could look realistic or maybe toned down but there would be equipment cards, boost cards, and character cards, you start off the game with 3 character cards and 1 boost card and 2 equipment cards, Whatever you select as your main character will always be in your deck until it dies, then its all rng There would be points to use an attack, for example every turn you get you get 5 energy points, you can save them til next turn then you would have 10 then 15 and so on and so forth I made this game with my friends but we used memes for characters I was thinking something with Mythology characters and weapons like Excalibur or Zeus stuff like that but they battle it out! The layout would look like your 2 hands holding all your cards (you can have more than 6) but then infront of you is a board where your cards fight when you summon the stuff from them, maybe have an animation where when you summon something you throw the card with 2 fingers and it bursts into the thing then shrinks down and goes on to the board which could also be like mountains or something. matches could be 1on1 2on2 or    something like a battle royale where you can control your main character to collect cards for 1 minute then battle against others. If someone does decide to make this dm me because I have more ideas"
bih3rz,Western Idea,"So I have no experience in programming and definitely don't want to get into it. I'm more of a writer, and I'm comfortable with that. However, I do have an idea that I think would be very interesting for somebody who can actually make it happen (not everybody would be able to as it's a pretty big idea).\n\nIt would be a hack-and-slash kind of game but with a lot of skill and timing involved in it. The basic premise would be that you're a warrior born with semi-superhuman strength and speed, but your strongest power would be that you have a special attribute in your hands. This could any number of things, from cutting power, to force, to even precision. You would have to fight off intelligent, humanoid bird creatures with special powers like metal feathers, super screams, etc. The fighting would start off as dodging and attacking when a window opens, but you could get much more aggressive once you find your weapon. You would find the weapon by first locating a fossil of one of the ancient bird people (I'll call them Avians from now on), and then you would... well, you'd beat the everloving shit out of it with your respective attribute. It would then give you a weapon to go with your attribute, which would change the combat up a bunch. First off, slashing weapons would change the combat by showing special lines for which way to slash the enemy, which would act as a critical hit. With precision weapons, you would need to hit certain circles for the same effect. The game would also have a special mana-esque mechanic called Lifeforce, which would be able to heal you during breaks in the fighting. Lifeforce would also be why the Avians were attacking. More specifically, they would be using it for some secret project to end humanity (crazy racism would be a thing on both sides so, uh... yeah....). Last but not least, there would be a few other human warriors that would assist you in some fights and stuff.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI urge any developer who might work on this to keep all earnings to their own team as I'm just a random person on Reddit, but I would like to request a credit in the form of the name ""Juniper"" hidden somewhere in the game (not as the MCs name please).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading, hope this helped anybody with... developer's... block? \n\n^((Is that even a thing???))"
bigi4y,Cleaning up the post apocalypse.,"Games like stardew valley, and harvest moon are pretty chill and relaxing. And after dozens of hours you get to look back on what you've done. The farm you've built, the tools you've earned and the relationships you've made.\nGames like Fallout have this big ugly mess of a world that was once alive, that is also beautifully somber.\nWouldn't it be nice to clean it up? Clear the clutter, re-use the materials, give life to vegetation, build civilization for hours on end. And after awhile you can look back in satisfaction at what you've accomplished.\n\nFallout 4 has this on a small scale, but ideally this game would be entirely based around the calm nature of cleaning, recycling, and rebuilding.\nThe game would be aesthetically similar to The Last Guardian but in a Fallout style world.\n\nI got the idea from playing House Flipping Simulator in which you do a lot of throwing away trash, cleaning messes, and building walls or furniture.\n\nIt'd be a pretty casual game for anyone to play and relax. Clean some junk, feed some animals, plant some trees, build a fence or something, I dunno.\n\nGod I wish I knew how to make games, and also had the focus to learn new things. All I could do is concept art."

bibtfb,realistic reloading,"Not a full game, but an interesting mechanic I have been thinking about recently, realistic reloading. This means that your max ammo is in clips, and taking one out doesn't magically transfer the bullets into your pocket bullet storage dimension. However, this has been done before (shout out to my Sierra 7 boys wooo!). What I'm thinking is that you would, instead of just throwing clips on the ground, attach them to your belt. Then, when in cover or after enemies are dead, there would be a button where you could transfer ammo from one used clip into another, making an empty/partially empty and a full one. In a game, it would probably be a good idea to make your character do this a bit faster than realistic (maybe he holds a bullet in between each finger and just slides them in, then quickly grabs 4 more off-screen), so that it isn't just the most tedious thing ever. Also, if you run out of clips, you could load partially used ones back into your gun (maybe on hard mode you wouldn't see how much ammo was left, and would need to rely on a visual indicator in the clip).  You would also have to play an animation (cancelable of course) of physically picking of clips of dead enemies to get their ammo. Just thought it might be interesting, I'm excited to hear any thoughts/criticism on the idea."

bi21gb,Western Style third Person village builder,"Gameplay:\nThird person controller. You can switch and control each of your settlers manually, assign them tasks and a proffession and define their daily routine. You and your fellow settlers have needs (food, sleep, shelter, goods) and wishes (comfort, entertainment, dreamjob, wealth). Improve on those and your settlement will attract more settlers that you can allow to settle in you village. Once your settlers have an efficient day life cycle you need to worry less about them and play the new joiners in your settlement. Having new opportunities ( salon, barber, sherif, priest, baker, etc) in your settlement will require the adjustment of the daily routines of your settlers  to take advantage of it. The building can freely be placed to build beautiful and efficient settlements. The inventory sytem is limited. If you want to carry something you have your hands, can carry a bag, pull a cart, ride a horse or even a carriage. If you cant effort your own transportations,  can pay others for larger transportation projects.\n\nStartconditions:\n- Money\n- Country of Origin ( unique items or abilities)\n- Number of family members\n\nHow the journey starts:\nYou take a train West. On the train you can talk to other passengers trying to convience them to join your adventure. Soon later the train stops and you exit on the last station.\nIn this little city you can go off by goods, a carrier, horse, cows and Equipment. You should also check out the saloon and ask for rumors. Its good to know where the natives have been seen last. This is the area to avoid  unless you are well equipped with guns and looking for fame and trouble. The other settlers will more likly seek their luck beeing a ranger, farmer or miner.\n\nOnce everything is sorted out you leave the city. The further away from the city you decide to settle the harder it will be to buy and sell goods. However in the long run it will be more attractive for other settlers to join your settlement.\n\nNow the hard work begins. You need a first house, gather resources, plant seeds and build the house. \n\nAfter the first year or two you will have enough products to sell them in the city. People hear about your settlement and ask you to join in. Once joined you can control them aswell. You can assign them jobs, build houses for them and you need to fullfill their wishes to keep them staying and attract more settlers.\n\n\nThank you for reading. I really would appreciate your feedback"

bhmaqa,"A telltale like game but instead of choices just impacting other choices and responses, they also change the art style/look of the game.","This game would use storytelling as its main mechanic. I don’t want to include story ideas here, as it is irrelevant, but I know it has to include the main character experiencing some kind of grief or sorrow. So how/why does the art style change? It changes to portray an emotion that the protagonist is feeling. For example: if the character is feeling empty, it might be a blank background with little polygons. If they were feeling angry, it might be grey and gritty and might feel rough.\n\nAs for the supporting characters? They will make the player feel guilty for choosing to hang out with one over the other. The idea is that you can’t satisfy everyone, and that you must prioritize some more than others. You can’t go back and fix your mistakes. This allows replay-ability. \n\nAs I say in all of my other posts, I have no intention of making this a reality and that the idea is up for grabs. Take it, change it, do whatever - this is just my idea."

bhjosp,A game where you solve a murder by dying and restarting,"Similar to the animes Erased and Re: Zero. This would pit a young protagonist against a serial killer. The killer's identity would he shrouded in mystery, so he'd need to investigate to find it.\n\nIf the protagonist dies, he restarts the same day, fully healed but aware of his death. As he dies more, his mental state may start to shift, causing the choices he makes and the ending to change."

bhitb2,Old-school FPS with strong environmental interaction?,"Lately I got the idea of making a first-person shooter along the lines of Doom. Mostly inspired by the rebooted series but paying attention to the first two games as well.\n\nOne of the criticisms I read about the 2016 installment was that all the levels felt the same. And a solution I came up with was beside making each level take place in a different ""area"" with a different atmosphere and aesthetic, include different environmental features that have a degree of randomness.\n\nFor example a factory level would have functioning industrial equipment like spiked grinders, falling millstones, rideable conveyor belts, etc. A volcano level would have steam vents that periodically vent hot harmful gas, or thin rock plates you can shoot through to drop enemies into lava.\n\nThe idea isn't to make levels with arbitrary gimmicks but rather to create believable ""living environments"" where the map is just as important to combat as the enemies are: a character in and of itself rather than just a static backdrop. There wouldn't be too many per level to prevent cluttering but just enough to add variety and keep the player on their toes, especially when backtracking.\n\nAnd what if they had some RNG? For example in one playthrough the level has your standard explosive barrels. The next playthrough the level has power cells that briefly stun nearby enemies when destroyed. And the next playthrough there's simply nothing. These types of games expect the player to replay individual levels many times to find all secrets or get all achievements, and this would be a great way to add replayability. They wouldn't be the main focus of gameplay but they would contrast with the predictable enemy behavior and give the combat an extra layer of depth.\n\nA complaint I heard about Doom 2016 was that combat became repetitive because the player needn't pay attention to their surroundings. I'm sure this system would help alleviate that as it can be beneficial or harmful, moreso if the enemy AI can be programmed to take advantage of them or avoid them. As in they push the player closer and closer towards a lava pit or shoot an explosive barrel right beside you.\n\nAll feedback is appreciated."
bhi96v,Bob the Blob,"TL;DR- a puzzle platformer in which you play as an amorphous blob,  to solve puzzles you’ll need to eat fruits that change your form in various ways.\n\nYou play as Bob the Blob and you’re just trying to get home to your little hut after a storm picked you up and tossed you far away. You’re lost in a forest, surrounded by ancient ruins, most of which are only passable when you are the right shape, and with the right abilities.\n\nThe simplest puzzles just require you to be the proper shape and standing on the proper platform. The more complicated puzzles will have you eating combinations of fruits in order to achieve more complex shapes that allow you to do more things like climb up walls, cross rivers, and even glide across gaps. You’ll be looking for keys to old doors, switches to step on, and just alternate paths around whatever obstacle you face. \n\nExamples of shapes range from the simple Block shape that helps you initiate specific floor switches. To a spiky ball that allows you to roll up walls. You can toggle your shape, and revert back to blob mode any time, and then toggle back into your previous shape. Blob mode makes you much more viscous allowing you to flow through narrow cracks in walls and under doorways with large enough gaps.\n\n\nI feel like combat could be a thing, with very simple goomba-like enemies that just walk at you. You can only fight while in blob mode though, you simply engulf them and then they dissolve in your innards. If you’re a specific shape and get touched they’ll deal damage and knock you back into blob mode."
bhhs5v,A realistic multiplayer space sim game,"First you'll get to choose a spaceship for your crew of 20 people, most likely your friends or random people auto matched. Each one of them has a task on their own ranging from repairing the spaceship to giving commands. Each player has a post and a job to do. Such as commander, pilot and etc.\n\nThe ship can be landed on life size planets which are far away, where other 20 or so people also land for survival. To reach them a spaceship and crew must face many obsacles such as asteroid belts, enemy encounters and etc. \n\nBasically the whole idea is 20 player teams maintaining a spaceship which cannot thrive without unity and leadership."

bhg1hu,What are your thoughts on this?,"I've always read on this subreddit but I never really post so I think now may be a good time and I want some feed back or am also open to suggestion about how to tweak it because it's a wip.\n\nSo basically I'm wanting to create a pixelated rpg style game based on that like Octopath Traveler. However my story is set in a modern/futuristic universe and combines sci-fi and major fantasy elements. The basic premise is that a protagonist day dreams fairly often of a world that doesnt exist and uses it as a means to escape his reality. He creates a beautiful world and has someone there he can talk to and relate to and ask reassurance from, only to find out the world he visits isnt only fantasy, and be him going to this world he attracts the attention of a group in the ""Real World"" that tries to sever ties from that Fantasy plane. As the main character, you team up with others who can also access that plane of the world and fight against both enemies in real life and in the fantasy plane ( I don't have a name for it yet.) Also, borrowing an idea from Persona in a way, the characters also accompanied by the Spirits, companions they created to help their worlds prosper. They range from defensive to aggressive types and can lend aid whenever needed. \n\nAnother thing I wanted to do though was multiple endings and a secret ending. I wanna make a moral percentage and depending on what the player does they can either get a good or bad ending or the secret ending. Depending on what relationships are formed and what exactly the player does throughout their journey to save their fantasy worlds from being destroyed. \n\nI'm kinda skimping out on a bit more detail but I wanna hear from you guys. Would you be interested in this type of game? Does it sound like a rip off? Give me some good feedback please this is something I've wanted to do for a while but never really got an idea to come to fruition."

bhen6p,Thoughts on a game concept I'm planning to make?,"So I've always wanted to make a fluid hack n' slash game, but I never felt like I was experienced enough to make one. After a few years of making different little games, I think I'm ready to move on to this idea.\n\nTHE IDEA\n\n* Different biomes w/ themed enemies (Ex: A jungle biome with little tree stump turret enemies that can root in place.)\n* A boss at the end of each biome with interesting mechanics. For the jungle biome, I was thinking of a boss that could spawn thorns around the fighting arena.\n* One weapon that can morph into many others (Ex: A sword that can be morphed into a double-edged sword, dual swords, etc.)\n* Fluid combat w/ many options and combos\n\nI'm not sure if this idea is enough and would generate interest.  Please share your thoughts and suggestions."
bh8697,Mmo team based survival game in post apocaliptyc world,"You start the game by choosing one of 3 or more bases.\n\nGame is set in a big modern city thats overrun by monsters.\n\nGoal of the game is that your base needs food for NPC's, medice for both ai and players, fuel to run generators for light, defences, food and water filtration, weapons and ammunition.\n\nOne player is voted to be a governor (or no governor and people just vote) and managers that are responsible for running the base like sending out groups to male sure provisions are met.\n\nGameplay would be you having to venture out and forage for equipment going deeper and deeper for more valuable stuff.\n\nMonsters are the real threat to avoid just straight up pvp and if you do try to assault enemy base to steal their stuff, your base wpuld be left vulnerable to momster attacks or even third faction trying to backdoor.\n\nSo what you guys think?\nThe idea for this is to force cooperation and not make anyone be one man army because the world is too brutal and every venturingoutside the walls need to be planned so you can succeed"
bh6zr0,Everything that you touch will rot,"This is the Anti-Midas story: A puzzle game about being dealt the most rotten hand by life, but striving to become a hero instead of succumbing to fate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt the start of the game, you are cursed by a wizard for being a dick. He says you are to never feel human touch again. Now you’re walking in the forest; the ground around your feet becomes grey and lifeless, cracking apart as you walk on them. Famished, you try to pick up fruits to eat, but they rot. You faint from the hunger. You wake up to see a kind old woman who generously feeds you. She gives you a pair of magic gloves, which helps you hold things. You can now toggle between gloved and bare hands. The woman tells you to rest at her cottage before it’s dark. That night, you wake up to her screams, and find bandits looting the place. They kill the old woman. You lunge at them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYour goal in the game is to avenge your savior, and find the wizard in order to force him to resurrect her. You gain temporary items like boots, helmet and weapons which slowly fall apart. Combat is simple, you try to touch the opponent before their weapon reaches you (I think VR is good for this kind of combat). You can also fight using your wit, for example touching the rope on a hanging bridge to make it fall. The game will also focus on story-based puzzles, like making a tree rot and fall over to get across obstacles, or poisoning people with your virus."
bh69kz,AUTISTIC GAMER REINVENTS THE EA BLUEPRINT,"My brother is autistic. He lives in a world all his own. For the last couple of years he has been mad at EA. The following information comes from my understanding of what my lil bro been trying to say. I think EA should jump on this: \n\nThe name of the game is UNDERBELLY, and it is an open-world action-adventure video game being developed in MYLILBROBRAIN to be published by EA SPORTS one of these days. It is to be released on November 14, my brothers birthday, and will be free to download on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.\n\nThe game takes place in a fictionalized version of New York City called New Amsterdam (I like the TV show and thought it sounds good), and ""Delphi"" (aka downtown/Manhattan) is a densely populated borough featuring one of the most vibrant commercial, financial and cultural centers in the world. With an exception to Delphi, the remaining four boroughs (i.e., Roselawn, Westwood, Hartwell, and Hillcrest) are primarily residential in function and blueprint. And based on various requirements players will be able to rent and/or buy an apartment or house to make his/her own. \n\nIt will feature a single-player storyline that will unfold as the player initiates and completes various player-specific missions. The open-world blueprint of UNDERBELLY is designed to permit players to freely roam the city, from either a third-person or first-person perspective, on foot or by vehicle. \n\nUNDERBELLY could represent the opening volley in what could and should be a new and truly inspired adventure for both MYLILBROBRAIN and the EA brand. \n\nWith such titles as The Sims, Madden NFL, FIFA, NBA LIVE, UFC, NEED FOR SPEED, NHL, and RORY MCELROY PGA TOUR, UNDERBELLY seeks to  present a new way for gamers to enjoy said titles. From now on, whenever a player buys any of these titles, upon downloading said game he/she will get the entire UNDERBELLY map; thus instantly transforming said game into a multiplayer. In addition to the aforementioned titles, it is hoped that EA will agree to incorporate Need for Speed into the UNDERBELLY blueprint. \n\n[Note: You should think of UNDERBELLY as the GRAND THEFT AUTO of Online sports gaming. New Amsterdam will be the Sports Capital of the World. Only in New Amsterdam will Madden NFL players ride in the same car with NBA Live players. Downtown will feature the stadiums and arenas of the NFL, NBA, BASEBALL (MLB the Show is good). EA owns all the titles needed to build a true gamers paradise. \n\nGames for incorporation: Madden NFL, FIFA, NBA LIVE, UFC, NEED FOR SPEED, NHL, Rory McIlroy PGA Tour, the Sims, MLB the Show, Grand Slam Tennis 2.\n\nPlease tell me if this is worth pursuing?"

blhavu,"Game which mixes mechanics from M&amp;B, Ryse, and Dragons Dogma. Feedback wanted!","**""Expedition...""**\n\nA single player first/third person shooter RPG with platoon fighting mechanics.\n\nThis game idea hinges on a few core mechanics.\n\n1. The platoon fighting mechanic in a free to roam map. Which fairly similar to how you lead soldiers much like in Ryse and Mount&amp;Blade, where the soldiers are controlled in units and have fairly simple fighting skills/programming. In the midst of combat paus to open the strategic HUD, command them in ways such as: selecting stances, positioning, rush target. Just like in Ryse and MB the PC is an active participant in the fighting, taking the role of a powerful mage/commander who supports/heals/summons/debuffs/attacks during combat in a similar fashion to dragons dogma. \n\n The player is not always with his troops and can command them to hold a position or make camp, enabling the player to explore on their own. \n\n2. Resource management in the field. Time - resting or spending too much time in one place is dangerous and allows your enemies to recuperate or attack you. Magicka/Mana has a limit recover over time, resting speeds up recovery. Soldiers, level up from experience and use their wages to buy better armor. Losing soldiers makes the game harder.  \n\n3. Huge open area levels. It may be one big open world or it may be several branched off levels connected by a campaign map. The purpose of the design is to fit multiple big battles and multiple ways to approach them all the while fitting main story narrative and diplomacy. While also containing, dungeon/landmarks and suitable encampments. Certain enemies move around the map, hunting or scouting. \n\n &gt;A make your own story version of this game could be quite fun and challenging with procedural generated environment and enemies. Every time the player starts a new game, it'd simply be a new expedition to an unknown world. But that's not the version I'm describing. \n\n4. Faction diplomacy. 3-5 factions of different size that the player can chose to ally with or against at different stages if they fit the criteria. In order to divide and conquer. Areas conquered by the players force will either be given/shared with allies or taken for your own. Areas given or shared with other factions will slowly be repopulated with that faction. Over time increasing that tribes available military and reinforcements.  \n\n**Setting**\n\nSet in a medieval fantasy world with themes from the ancient Rome, European folklore and the conquistadors. The aim is to give the player the sense of wonder of an explorer and the experience of a overpowered roman general with an undersized army campaigning in Gaul or Caledonia, constantly fearing attacks from hedonistic foreign barbarians with deadly strange magic and religion. But as the game progresses switch to offer a take on the fear that they Gauls held for the Romans and Indians held for the conquistadors. \n\nStory premise\n&gt;Your world is at war, a world where mages rule. Where slavery and human sacrifices is commonplace.  An unforgiving enemy is steadily gaining ground. The only way for your people to survive is somehow find a way to halt the enemy's advance or find refuge beyond the their reach. Fortunately, a secret discovery has opened the way to a new world. The player is a junior mage part of expedition to this world. While little of this world is explored, scouts have reported sighting dangerous beasts, new flora and fauna, ruins of great civilizations and feral humanoid tribes. With the mission to explore and expand the player is assigned command over company of legionaries, specialist and skirmishers. \n\n&gt;**Main story objective**  \nWill you uncover the means with which humanity can turn the war, or will you secure the exodus and the safe colonization of this world? \n\n**Mission**\n\nMissions are all part of different arcs in the story providing the reason for your expedition into that particular area of the new world and setting the main objectives.\n\n**Secondary objectives**\n\n* Explore dungeons while your troops camps outside the player explores the dungeon. Usually ruins, lairs or caves. Sometimes specialist, alien spell, or puzzles are needed to venture further.\n\n* Magical altars or Cursed places. Perform the correct ritual or lift the curse in order for rewards.\n\n* Establish mining outpost, research outpost or border fortresses.\n\n* Beasts are powerful monsters or magical creatures that won't be intimidated by numbers alone. When provoked they will defend themselves, if they are hungry they will hunt for dinner. Attacking another force whilst it is defending from a beast attack or leading a beast into an enemy waiting to ambush you can be very effective. Fighting them can be very dangerous without an effective strategy.\n\n* Intelligent enemies are mostly humanoid tribes of varying races that will organize to expel any invaders discovered by their scouts and will try to signal for help if attacked. They have their own mages. By mastering their language through magic and gaining an understanding of their worldview the player may gain an ally against a common enemy, information about the area, trade possibilities or just an edge over them in battle. You need to subjugate them or eliminate them.\nThere are also more civilized factions that won't automatically attack unless provoked and with which the diplomacy is a bit more complicated.\n\n**Resources and objectives**\n\n* The most important parameter regarding enemies is time, beasts hunt and intelligent enemies scout while time passes, they will also get replenished over time. The more time that passes the higher the chance that the players expedition will be discovered and attacked. Only while the player is in dungeons do time stop for beasts and scouts. The players encampment can be attacked while player is away in ""Exploration"" mode.\n\n* Every soldier is sorely missing from the front and you must strive to achieve your objectives with as few losses as possible. Losing soldiers makes subsequent battles in a mission much harder and make manpower hinged objectives harder or sometimes impossible to complete. In the long run it decrease the quality of reinforcing troops, as the expedition leadership will not want to waste veterans to be your meat-shield.\n\n* Soldiers like living and will spend their own money and loot to buy better armor and weapon.\n\n* Seek out strange magical artifacts, materials, fauna, flora, beasts, ruins, languages and ruins on an alien world. Empower yourself and your troops from advances due to research of your findings. New gear, specialized tactics, new spells, dark alien rituals to grant you new power.\n\n* Gather intelligence and negotiate with newly encountered tribes, gang up on common enemies, enslave them and trade with faction you don't have the power to take from.\n\n* Some magic spells require sacrifices and your mission is utmost importance, use your troops or captured slaves in order to fuel your magic.\n\n* Your magic usage has its limits and while you are getting stronger, and you can supplement your own magical energy with that of sacrifices. You do need to rest between its use.\n\n* While encamped you can open a portal to the expedition headquarter to resupply, reinforce, change specialist and deliver your discoveries. However, opening a portal takes time, requires lots of magic - (especially if you don't have a sacrifice) that could have been spent on resting. Study new spells between missions and while encamped. \n\n* Time spent resting by the mage can be well spent by the different specialist in the team: Healers will heal troops, the rangers may reveal more bits of map decided by the player, acolytes may prepare more wards, summoning spells or captured slaves for spells. Beast hunters may prepare traps or investigate nearby monsters. Engineer build/repair structures or machines.\n\n**Marching mode**\n\nDuring the Marching mode, you command your platoon from your character on a floating dais in the center of column. But the mage is by no means locked to the dais, it is a vantage point and a ritual altar which enhances the mage capabilities and enables the usage of sacrifices. Determining the pace of the march and position of different units. For performance and simplicity's sake the legionaries fight in groups of 5 or 10, their function is to hold the line while the mage, bodyguard and specialists do the most killing. The ranged squad function is to take care of other ranged threats or large units. Together your platoon is capable of steamrolling armies several times it size. The mage if allowed is capable of creating huge golems out of earth or drawing twisted being into shape from unnamed dimension, summoning tornadoes and lightning storms. Creating walls of earth, ice, fire in order to control the battlefield. Wrecking havoc among his enemies while at the same time being able to empower his legionaries with inhuman combat abilities. Specialist can prepare traps, buff spells or enable special spells, heal and buff your troops.\n\nSometimes you need stop in order to scry the area or allow the rangers to scout determine best route to take or how to best take an engagement.\n\n**Combat strategy**\n\n* if you need to stop and make camp (where to stop and make camp?) in order to rest, heal up and prepare certain spells or tactics. Will you need to create a huge earth golem to keep a big enemy occupied? Or will the enemy be susceptible to certain weapon enchantments on your troops? Perhaps the enemy has a lot of spellcaster and you need to ward you troops and prepare your own anti-magic user attacks? The downside being giving the enemy a possibility to scout you and attack you, rendering you preparations useless. The fun in this part lies in preparing for a huge scenario fight, while also taking a bit of a risk. The more time you take to prepare, the more risk you take.\n\n* Finding a good position to attack from and positioning of all the troops to hold the flanks. Placement of the supply wagons.\n\n* Try to kidnap an enemy, learn their secrets and try to play tribes against each other.\n\nI don't know what more to write, I'm just be happy if someone took their time to actually read all this."

Co-op like “lovers in a dangerous space time quarrel” is pretty chill but I’m also up for fighting or any other style.

bkvk9d,Point control RTS focused on weapon and supplies,"I'm considering a game idea and want to know if it's too much micro managing to play.\n\nI guess it's most like Company of Heroes but set in a Stalker like setting.\n\nYou control a gang and have to secure control points on roads.\n\nYou earn rep and money whenever a merchant or neutral party passes through one of your points. But lose rep is one of these is attacked on your territory.\n\nThe amount of new gang members you get is based on your rep compared to the other players. Having 1/5 of the total rep means you get 1/5 of the new members.\n\nMoney is used to buy better equipment and supplies for individual gang members. This means weapons and armour would be managed on a per person basis, I think like DoW1 does it.\n\n\nTo me, this sounds fairly standard and pretty boring.\nI want to add bandits and neutral creatures to make it a bit less plain but my real question is suplies and supply lines.\n\nI want squads to only carry so many rounds and medical kits, with supplies held in the control points. This would mean that after fighting, the gang members would need to return to a control point to get more supplies. This means that the player would need to setup supply lines so that these control points can get ammunition from the main base.\n\nDoes this mechanic along with managing the equipment (potentially) per person make the game too annoying ?\n\nCheers."
bkvj9m,Army Exile - an e-sports capable Battle Royale??,"The background of this game is that the army is looking for a team of recruits to hire in their secret service. They have selected 80 possible recruits and have placed them in a remote island to be tested for their skills; they are placed on the outskirts of the Island by the army (15 squads in total) while 5 squads wake up in unknown POIs after being rendered unconscious. There are 3 types of recruits in each squad:\n\n**- Medic:**\n\nThe Medic acts as the backbone of the squad by providing provisions and healable to the other possible recruits. The Medic has 2 weapon slots; one main weapon and a secondary weapon. It also has 3 available slots, allocated to healables.   The heals can be found in local deserted stores scattered all over the island which can be a source of some really interesting fights. The Medic can work to heal their teammates, remaining completely vulnerable to fire.\n\n**- Builder:**\n\nThe Builder acts as the protection of the team, by collecting bricks scattered throughout the island and storing them in his backpack. He also has 2 weapon slots; a main weapon and a secondary weapon. The Builder has 2 build slots; a wall and a floor, which takes 6 seconds to build each. The Builder can serve to protect the Medic who may be reviving a teammate or to protect them in general. While building however, he is completely vulnerable to fire and can or may be protected by mercenaries (down below). Keep in mind that the more bricks the Builder stores, the more heavier he gets.\n\n**- Mercenaries (2):**\n\nThey act as the main source of firepower and are allocated 3 weapon slots; 2 main weapons and a firearm, with an extra 2 slots for throwables, which they can find at the ammo stations. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere is an airship hovering over the island, where the squads have to get to and win over everyone to achieve a spot on that airship and be recruited (victory I guess?). After a certain period of time, the army closes in on the island, pushing the squads towards the airship. If any possible recruit is out of the zone, he is met by gunfire from the army soldiers (5 damage a tick).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDon't know if any other game is based on this, however, I feel like it is a pretty neat idea to provide a free to play, strategy based game."

The whole thing was set up in my mind as a restored graphics mobile 16-bit game but take it as you will. If things do not make sense it's probably just my mind filling in the gaps. Also used voice to text. \n\nAlien species unnamed attack the surface of the Earth they travel in groups and are reptilian but have scales of blue and tannish gold they are the size of human but a little bit bigger and their tails I like I like venom's tongue and with some people they will attack crowds and groups of people they will kill most with their tails but for some they will  shrink down to the size of squirrels latch onto the back of their hand and stick their tails inside the the under neath the palm you were then transported to this room with a giant tail I touch the tail and I know there's a booming voice telling me to call the tailor I obliged and underneath the wall there is a giant head probably the head honcho of this entire species. He goes on this rent about how we have destroyed their planet I get confused and I'm like what? He said they've been living underground for thousands of years and we've been drilling into their homes I said that doesn't excuse the fact that you have countless murders on your hand he said it's also a price to pay. While this is going on, a group of ret con police force is trying to take out the countless clusters of the alien species and some have infiltrated their area. When they change emotion, they suddenly they secrete a fluid of a different color based on what mood they're exhibiting. so while he was distracted I grabbed his tail and skewered him in the head and then the dream ended the idea is supposed to be frightening but at the same time a lot of humor mixed in.

bkidhs,Hack and Punch? Slash? Who knows,"Unless i get a billion dollars and some actual game making skill, this most likely wont become anything special, but its always nice to just bring your ideas out there.\n\n**-** ***Lets start here***\n\nI'm not going to get into the story or anything much, but this is about the gameplay, characters, and fighting go. Although this is mostly just gameplay oriented. \n\nIts based in the real world, and to gist everything simply, some characters have been given very peculiar powers. For instance, the main character had gotten injured when receiving first his power, losing his arm (in the story, blah blah blah wont waste your time). But thankfully to combat this, he was given the power to control rock to his will, with this power he was able to make his own arm made of rock, and after plenty of story, you get to play as him *at first.* \n\nFor now i'll start of with some fighting mechanic goodness.\n\n\- **Fighting Mechanics**\n\n\-Skill Trees \n\nFirst off there is a skill tree, think of a God of War skill tree to some degree, But they each have a separate category, lets say 3. Strength, (physical ability), Ranged, and Speed. What makes the abilities so different from each other?, and how does it affect you? Well one different aspect is that it actually affects what the character **looks like physically.** \n\nFor example, you get your character starting out with a semi normal body, but lets say you put a lot of skill points into Strength, thanks to the power he has (from the story, might not make sense just saying this..) and the way the power affects him, his body will slowly transform, getting thicker and bigger with each point, gradually growing into this huge character, his rock arm will become bigger, and his body will transform with the points. **But** if you put more points into speed, his body becomes more slim, and taller. \n\nThe strength category makes you more damage reliant, by having less combos but hits like a truck. While ranged is more staying back and causing damage from afar. While speed is heavily combo reliant and you get the most reward for having bigger combos. (For instance the bigger the combo, the more of a combo finisher you get)\n\n**NOTE:** Each skill tree can be chosen at any point, you can put points in multiple trees, but you have to choose one category at a time. \n\nThis leads to strategy in boss fights, knowing which form will benefit you the most, having too many tools could be confusing and could possibly make battles much easier. \n\n\-Supers\n\nYou also have a super in each category, for example the ranged category may have a super that makes your fist giant, and it flys off your arm into enemies, but there is also upgrades to it. \n\nWhen you complete a tree, a new skill comes up at the bottom of the tree, there it will upgrade your super, so instead of it just being a giant fist, perhaps you make multiple, or maybe it can stun nearby enemies it didnt hit. ( Okay that was a bad example but you get it?)\n\nAlso a super has 3 forms that builds up over a fight, or how combo heavy you are. (Yes i thought about the speed skills being overpowered  by being able to combo easily, the combo/super meter is affected by what tree you are. For example a strength combo can be x11, but it is equal to the amount of a speed combo which is x35)  The first will be the base super, the second and third form are more of a upgrade to that super. The 3rd level is what is unlocked after completing a skill tree. \n\n**- Saving Mechanic** \n\nI miss older games where you had to wait and find saving points, i don't like where you can just save anywhere from pausing. Even though saving wont be difficult as it is in some games, this is a bit different. In this game there is a corrupt government and such others looking for you/hunting you down. (More story BS) and no, not like infamous, i can hear someone saying that now. Anyways in these groups of people you fight, its possible that there is one enemy (located on your map or any other way to look) that also have some type of power, they are a bit more difficult then normal enemies but not hard enough to waste your time. Because i am sure everyone can agree that after a while a mechanic like this is different, but tedious if given limited resources. Either way, these enemies drop a item that you can bring over to a save zone, and you save there.\n\n While you go to different missions or whatever, you may run into one or two on the way, so you wont have to always worry about wasting your time finding one if you want to save the game and get your ass to work quickly.\n\n\- **More Gameplay? More Characters?!**\n\nIts cool having a badass that can do this stuff, he has a cool power, can easily punch some people in the ground, or can combo someone forever. But what if i told you, you can play more then just him?\n\nNow this is what i like, because think of a hack and Slash, you go with the combination you like, you upgrade the skills as you want and play. And no matter how fun it is, it CAN get boring seeing the same thing. \n\nAs the story progresses you do run into other characters with powers different from yours, for instance a swordsman was able to get the ability to have amazing senses. This can be fun because maybe you're tired of punching people with a big rock hand, and seeing the same combos. Now change that fist into a sword, and change the moveset around and boom, another new experience. (And it can also make you more flexible with your skills, perhaps you want to put all strength on the main character, while the swordsman has all speed)\n\nThis is where it gets rocky though, personally i can see only 1-3 characters being able to be different, and using more then one character in a game can be difficult to manage. \n\nSome questions can be, ""How tedious will the skill progression be with each character?"" Or maybe ""Why not use one character throughout the whole game?""\n\nI want it so you can have fun with them fast, i don't want it to be a grinding game, no one wants to spend their time leveling up another character when your main char is already a high level. That's why i feel that when you get a skill point, the other characters do as well. So if you get that swordsman, and the main character had used 4 skill points, then you start with 4 skill points on the swordsman. \n\nAnd obviously some missions or fights will require you to use separate characters depending. But i do not like to limit my players to one character all the time, flexibility and a creative mindset is what makes a game good. Right?\n\n**- Semi Conclusion** \n\nI'm not expecting this to be a game, because i have no skill myself at making them, nor a million of dollars to do so. But i think its important to put your ideas out no matter if they are bad or good. Cause who knows, maybe someone will come across it and say, ""Hey maybe i can put that in *my* game."" \n\nI put a lot of time in my ideas, and although they are worthless to everyone, they are what can set you apart from others. \n\nAnyways this game is not thought out ALL the way, But i do like to come up with ideas for it now and there, anyways if anyone even goes through this all it'd be nice to see some feedback or questions. This is my first post here as well so if there needs to be better communication, or if I do something wrong let me know!"
bkf4m3,Play with the Cards You're Dealt,"Starts out like a survival or RPG game with varying character traits. However, you don't get to customize yourself. Your starting physicals, including sex, body type, strength, etc. are all randomized. You can still customize by acquiring clothing, hair products, etc. in the game or by working out, etc., but that tapes time and possibly in-game currency that you could be using to progress. Perhaps there could also be expensive sex-changes and such in the game."
bkemev,Just an idea I have.,"Now, I know this will NEVER be made unless I magically got the money to run the magical money sinks called free to play mmo's, but I can dream right? \n\nYes, I am writing and will probably, if i feel like dreaming more, do all the sprites and tiles for a game that will never be made, gives me something more to do than work, play a game, sleep, repeat.\n\nSome of this might be a bit out of order, sorry.\n\n# Classes\n\nFirst off so far what I have is three classes, Warrior, Mage, Archer. Typical classes you always see. In PvP each class has a preferred match up, but is not limited to that match up.  The way I made this so far is, Archer &gt; Warrior &gt; Mage &gt; Archer. \n\nArchers deal sustained piercing damage which is strong against armor, They use their range and slows to have the advantage over a warrior. Archers use stamina for skills. \n\nWarriors deal strong physical damage and have high health and resistance to magic. They can easily close the gap between themselves and a mage. Warriors use Rage for skills.\n\nMages deal burst magic damage and their barrier decreases piercing damage received. They slightly out range Archers and can lock them down with freezing spells if needed. Mages use mana for skills. \n\n# Battle System\n\nThe battle system is where it gets interesting though. It is the usual target enemy, press skill button but, you can swap classes any time. It has a 2 second cooldown. Find yourself in a pinch as a mage, switch to a warrior or archer in an attempt to turn the tables. If you run out of your classes skill resource, switch to another class to regenerate it faster. \n\nThe classes do not have the same amounts of health, but when you switch you keep the same percentage. EX. Warrior 25/100 hp switches to mage 12/50 hp. \n\nSkills are balanced around this play style. Heal has a somewhat longer cool down that what you would be used to in other games. This is because you heal a flat amount but since a mage has low health, your warrior class hp will take a huge heal. \n\n# Leveling\n\nLeveling in this game would be quite fast, level 1 - 70 in about 3 hours, because of an ""interesting"" concept. When you die in Open World PvP, PvE, Hard mode Dungeons and Raids, your level is reset to 1. Your level is not reset if you die in a Duel, Arena, Solo Dungeon or Easy Dungeon. \n\nThis of course comes with the question, what about PvP campers. There is a limit to PvP. A level 10 can not attack lower than a level 8 unless they attack them first, and maybe a level 70 can go as low as 65. It has not been fleshed out as much yet. \n\nExp is gained though both PvE and PvP but you get a bounty put on you if you PvP alot. \n\nLeveling will not say the same speed though out though. EX. You hit level 20 and die. you now have a permanent 2x exp boost for levels 1-20. It increases with each level up to the level cap, where you would get a permanent 2.5x exp boost. \n\nYou do not lose access to any skills you learn from level up, but they are scaled down to lower tiers. Gear is level based, but there will be a way to set up multiple sets to auto equip on levels. \n\nMonsters do drop EXP potions and there are Craftable Level potions to make it easier as the game goes on. \n\n# Gear\n\nGear is level based, so you can not equip level 70 gear at level 1. There is how ever a system to put your sets of gear to be auto equipped at certain levels. You do need to get your gear first though. \n\nYour gear does change in appearance and stat wise based on your class. If you have a sword that has +5 strength on it, when you change to a mage, it becomes a staff with +5 intelligence or a bow with +5 dexterity if you switch to Archer.\n\nThere are multiple tiers of gear. \n\nCommon are dropped by over world monsters. \n\nUncommon are dropped by named monsters. \n\nRare are dropped by World Bosses. \n\nEpic are dropped in Easy Dungeons.\n\nLegendary are dropped in Hard Dungeons. \n\nMythic are dropped in Raids. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe six tiers are grouped together in pairs. \n\nCommon and Uncommon both have one stat line, but Uncommon has a higher base damage/defense. \n\nRare and Epic both have two stat lines, but Epic has a higher base damage/defense. \n\nLegendary and Mythic both have three stat lines, but Mythic has a higher base damage/defense. \n\n# Story\n\nUhh, WiP\n\n# PvP\n\nPvP has some slight restrictions to keep the game fun and fair. There is no upper limit to who you can attack, but there is a lower limit. EX. A level 70 can not kill a level 5 unless that level 5 attacks them first.  \n\nThe immediate area around a World Boss while it is alive is deemed a no PvP zone while the boss is alive and for one minute afterwards.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPvP has a five class bounty system. \n\nClass D Bounty; 1- 5 kills.

bk9wub,"Pokemon-like turn based spaceship fighting game where you capture or scrap ships to join your side, taking damage can destroy ships in your swarm, and hitting certain counts of ships in your swarm upgrades your abilities","So the Galaxy is at war. There's a giant Frontline across a multiple star systems. Your job is to orbital-nuke the enemy base. Trouble is: you're the last engineering fleet left after a great battle.\n\nUsing whatever small weapons you have on your puny ships, you start by jumping small fleets of scouts and scrapping their ships or capturing them to add to your fleet. Eventually you snowball and can take on larger, better equipped fleets.\n\nThe more ships you accumulate, the better you can fight. Having one missile cruiser unlocks the 'Missile Barrage I' skill, and having five unlocks 'Missile Barrage II' etc.. different types of ships let you use different abilities.\n\nTaking damage to your fleet causes damage to the ships, and can destroy them. You always control the fleet as a whole, and not individual ships."

bk98h1,A game about building transportation and logistical networks,"This is a game that exists as a top-down view of a map. What you need to do is find ways to move goods that you receive as contracts from one place to another. That's the essential bit of the game. \n\nTo expand on this further, you are a new logistics business within a city. You only have a few trucks with drivers to your name and need to find contracts for your trucks to fill to make money. You have to pay the truck drivers their wages, deal with insurance companies, pay for the upkeep of the trucks and such things. Once you have assigned a truck driver to a route they carry out the delivery with no further instruction needed. To do this well you need to schedule your drivers on their shifts to ensure they are driving whenever possible and always making you money. Good scheduling is what would make or break a game. As you gain money you can buy new trucks, fill them with drivers and get them going.\n\nAs the player completes more contracts with the company, they build trust with that company. This opens more and more contracts. These new contracts would be more valuable and with some at the highest trust levels being permanent contracts where the player has to consistently deliver cargo at specific times. \n\nOnce the player has achieved a certain level of funds they can begin to expand their networks to other cities in the fictional nation - eventually covering the whole nation. This opens up certain other types of networks like rail, sea, and air networks where they pay to utilise trains, cargo ships, and aeroplanes to carry their cargoes more effectively and efficiently while maintaining a road transportation network. For example, large amounts of cargos can be shipped from a port city, via rail, to another city and then shipped via local truck routes to their destination."
bk8ye7,"Life Support- A Dumb Ways to Die-like set of minigames, but the goal is to keep the human body alive.","Art style:\n\nIt would have simplistic 2d graphics with more saturated and bright colors.\n\nDifficulties and mechanics:\n\nThe game will have various difficulties, like average Joe (easy), athlete (medium), and daredevil (hard). In all difficulties, the challenges will get harder as you progress. There are no ""lives"", but rather a health bar that goes down (and up!) depending how well you do on each challenge.\n\nThe first and most common minigame will be a timing minigame to get the heart beating, which is similar to the poking a bear with a stick game from Dumb Ways To Die.\n\nThe next game is for the lungs, which requires blowing in to the mic at certain times.\n\nAnother game requires dragging different-colored electric signals to their matching-color neurons in the brain.\n\nThe final game (I can think of) is that you help digest food by lightly shaking your phone to get the food to the stomach acid. Shaking your phone too hard will cause your character to 'lose their lunch' and your health bar will go down.\n\nAnother key mechanic is that your person could get injured or have a stroke/heart attack. This frantic minigame appears 1 every 25 games on easy mode, 1 every 15 games on medium, and one every 5 games on hard. The kinds of games vary from mending multiple broken bones at once, quickly unblocking arteries by 'flicking' your screen, and tilting your phone to get the blood to the brain. Failing to complete any of these games will result in an instant game over.\n\nThank you for listening to my idea, and feel free leave any suggestions in the comments, or make this a reality through the magic of code."

For smartphone its sort of the same but different, you can customize notch, hole punch, etc, or set up pop out cameras, etc.  Moving away from the creative side, pricing and the amount of variants of design, as well as the software (allowing you to create an OS as well and do some tweaks there).

bjbrs0,Open world left for dead style story based game,"Hey fellow game Devs, and creators. So a few weeks ago I posted asking what people disliked and liked about survival games as I'd been meaning to start a zombie survival project for well over 4 years (it's what got me into game development), so I finally got around to it and im super excited to get this thing going. In the past weeks I've implemented most of the mechanics (they are far from polished but they're there and they work) including noise sensitive and horde AI where I can run nearly 300 AI units at once, shooting and inventory mechanics, locomotion like climbing, crouching, rolling all that. So here's my rundown on how the game will play and I'd like to know your thoughts.\n\nPlayer starts off alone and the first few story quests are just getting basic supplies, the player is free to explore the world while there are random events such as hordes wandering zombies and enemy survivors wandering around. Once the player progresses through some of the storyline which will be exploring the character and their past the player will be guided through clues to find a small camp of survivors after saving a random ai. After the player goes to the camp they will be able to upgrade their skills (medical expertise, stealth, etc.) Through a point system gained by killing zombies and rescuing more survivors. From this point on the focus of the game is reclaiming the land, there will be missions to clear out large numbers of infected, restore power, find renewable food and water supplies, etc. \n\nThere won't be base building but more of a farcry new dawn style upgrade system... Do things for the community and gather materials = get points to upgrade base camp. There will also be less focus on survival mechanics and more focus on strategy and arcade style gameplay. There will be a more fps oriented inventory (no slots and drag and drop etc.), You can only carry 2 weapons and a mele. The game world is also based in semi outback Australia Paterson NSW.\n\nNow the story is going to be based within a year or two of the infection spread from the coast so the story will be along the lines of heading inland to get away from cities and large towns but as the player goes through the missions they discover through story that the infected continue to follow as if they knew where the survivors were. But since the apocalypse is so new this means most vehicles will be accessible, some places left untouched by the events and electricity and automated systems still running on their own (minus some storyline events). And due to the location and Australia's gun laws, weapons and ammo will be scarce in the beginning of the game until more plot is revealed and the player finds new enemies and in return new weapons. Most guns will be found locked away inside farm houses which the player will have to solve puzzles in order to collect. I was also thinking infected and non infected native animals, so koalas, kangaroos, dingos etc. Would all be something the player has to worry about.\n\nI know survival games are flooded but it's just what I want to make and it will probably be free to play anyway. However I still want to make an interesting game so if you have any thoughts or constructive criticism I would love to hear from you. Cheers."

bncj2w,Hey I’m looking for some good game ideas that won’t get a CND (it means you can not use any company owned materials/character),
bncelz,Battle Royale concept; Internet Royale,"Internet Royale\n\nDifferences from other games\n- instead to a storm or zone closing around you, your on a collapsing battle ground\n- you jump out of a portal being carried by a drone at the start of the game.\n- create a hell load of possibilities of what you can become and use it to face other people to the death\n\nAny ways here is the concept\n \nIn this battle royal game mode players will have to find badges, amulets that give people weapons and the skills to use them, to battle to the death. Only one may stand. There are 3 periods Period one is landing I which players jump out of a flying vehicle they can get. the majority of the players who chose a certain vehicle will be the vehicle the players jump out from. If there is a tie in flying vehicles, then it will become the default flying vehicle, a drone holding a portal. From a normal plane to a giant flying base to a secret sky island, to finally a flying tank. Period 2 is raiding in which the players will find chests with a 100% chance to get a badge. 3rd period is the reducing period in which the ground starts to rumble and after 2 minutes the ground outside the safe zone will crumble quickly and if your not in the safe zone at that time you will fall with the ground killing u. Also not helpful people can still kill u during the stage and there is a 10% chance the ground shaking will launch u up one time and deal fall damage.  \n\nBadges \nBasics: A player can only Carry 3 badges. The more badges you have,fused or not, the more versatile u become in arsenal. The more better rarities you get/ the forged, the more damage u can deal.  Not only that imagine what badges you can get from the many fictional/ nonfictional  weapons and characters in the internet. You can become a meme character like sanic and wield a hunting rifle and captain America’s shield (possibly) or become shrek and fart large gasses to damage opponents. Oh there are many possibilities, you can even become a nuclear Grandi for any thing.

bn8qtk,"Wizard CSI Police Force: ""Detroit: Become Human"" meets ""Harry Potter""","Imagine a game where you're playing two detectives on a special CSI team in an urban city, but one of the main characters is a wizard and can see the magical beings and forces of the world while the other is a regular detective who sees everything in the lens of the modern world. They and several others in their task force must protect the city from a growing threat of magical creatures and contain their activities. (This was inspired by Connor and Hank from ""Detroit: Become Human"")\n\n* The special CSI team is made up of wizards acting under the guise of policemen and the normies that act as the perspective of what regular people see. Ex: Wizard fighting a demi-demon seen as a policeman vs a crazed druggie with a knife.\n* The magical world is just as powerful as the normal world- Different strengths and weaknesses\n   * The magical world gives the ability to use magic and wands and see different creatures of magic and forces. However, wizards are few and it is uncommon to find another wizard just in your neighborhood, so you're often alone in fighting these magical forces. Plus mana is limited and recharges slowly. Also, it is often hard for regular wizards to see the ""normal world"" on a daily basis, as it conflicts with their vision of the magical world at the same time, so they rely on normies to help them.\n   * The normal world has the advantages of modern technology, but still can't see the magical world and creatures as what they really are, often complicating communication between normies and wizards. However, they make up the majority of the normal population, so they have the most resources available to them.\n* Underneath the leadership of a few wizards who can both see the regular world and the magical world on a daily basis, the Magical CSI Police can work to team up to combine magic and modern technology into an effective countermeasure against magical creatures.\n   * Flashbangs enchanted with ""Holy Light"" can temporarily stun demons and prevent them from gaining more strength from their mana.\n   * Guns specially made with infused mana can shoot demons and magical creatures, usable by both normies and wizards. \n   * Thermal sensors that are enchanted with mana sensors, giving a little interpretation open to normies to sense demons and magical beings.\n   * Emergency resurrection and Fast Healing spells infused with defibrillators and special bandages.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Wizard Main Character- \n   * Is paired with the Normie Main Character in a homicide and drug trafficking case that is actually a satanic ritual run by a chain of demi-demons in the slums.\n   * Has a wand that from the normie perspective looks like a new gun prototype from the lab.\n   * Is often the dude fighting more often of the two.\n* Normie Main Character\n   * Is paired with the Wizard Main Character in a very brutal homicide case that eventually leads to a gang of organ sellers and druggies.\n   * Has a special infused mana gun sponsored by the Wizard CSI department.\n   * Is often the dude investigating more often of the two.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThoughts?"
bn80dw,Relatively Basic Survival Game,"# Pointless information:\n\nI've always enjoyed survival games immensely. Minecraft was the first proper game I ever got addicted to. I've since played countless survival games ranging from The Forest, to The Long Dark. Most survival games happen to have a pretty poor or basic story to explain how you've gotten where you are. A few days back I had this surprisingly vivid backstory idea for a survival game.\n\n# Backstory:\n\nYour alarm wakes you up. You're in your house, and to make this short and sweet, you live an entire (in-game) day. Eat breakfast, go to work, etc. This could be considered the tutorial stage. End the day by returning to your bed. You awake and begin what starts off as a normal day. Very quickly you find that absolutely every human in your town has disappeared without trace. They didn't pack up and leave as vehicles are still in driveways, and houses appear to be in perfect condition. This is essentially where you begin to survive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Things I've Thought About a Bit But am Not Really Sure About:\n\n* 3d? 2d? Probably wouldn't really matter. 3d of course gives more opportunity for feeling more attached to your character and/or the world around you.\n* What would differentiate this game from others? In my opinion there's an incredible amount of things you can do with a survival game to make it different in almost every aspect. As I haven't thought too much about gameplay, I don't really know what could make it unique.\n* Well this could make it sorta unique: I think the zombie survival is far oversaturated, and I think this game could be well suited for a more organic and realistic survival experience. By realistic I do not mean hardcore. I mean animals (and perhaps disease) are your worst predator. I'm really thinking about The Long Dark here, but far less hardcore. \n* The story could be manipulated or expanded upon throughout the game. I really like how Subnautica does its story. It's very organic, and flows well with whatever else you're doing. It feels simultaneously surreal and... like it's all a sort of secret discovery. So what I'm saying is, perhaps you learn more about what's happened to this town over time. No ""go to point a to find a clue"", but you just sorta find it on accident. Or.. 'accident'.\n* The world itself has a lot of potential. Initially I was thinking that you lived on a secluded, but modern town surrounded by miles of forest, and maybe on its own small island. After the disappearance of everyone, I was thinking the world turns into your same city but 100 years have somehow passed and now it's ruins, covered in flora and fauna. Then I also thought that the world could stay simply as a mysteriously abandoned town. I'm kind of thinking of the Roanoke Colony there.\n* Another sort of far fetched but possibly intriguing thought I had was a procedurally generated world. Not necessarily infinite, but the town and surrounding terrain is different each time you play the game.\n\n# Final Thoughts:\n\nI know I didn't really include a lot of details on much. There's so many things that I *could* come up with on the subject of survival games, but I figured I'd rather not muddy the base idea here. I just discovered this sub and quickly found people aren't fond of over-detailing, so I tried to leave most of my ideas pretty open. Always willing to alter things; switch it up whether for the benefit of the developer, or the player. And a small disclaimer: This is **not** something I expect, or really even *want* anyone to make. I really just wanted a place I could throw my idea onto, and maybe even get a few suggestions from the community here. That being said, feel free to criticize or add onto any of the aspects mentioned. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# TL;DR\n\nA survival game with a little more focus on the story. No zombies, just nature. All townspeople mysteriously disappear, except for you, of course."
bn4b2v,Harry Potter series but it's set out like the Arkham games,
bn08io,Myst / The Witness / Accounting + / Inception,"I just completed my play-through of The Witness, and was honestly really blown away by the puzzle depth, and compelling nature of the narrative told through the puzzles.  I was especially impressed by how much it reminded me of Myst.  Between the biomes, the layouts, the feeling of progress but also being lost; it was such a familiar feeling of wonder and amazement.\n\nI was think then of what I would do if I could make a Myst-like game, similar to The Witness in basic structure: biomes with concepts, island as the entire map, no narration or voices or characters, and using context and clues to further yourself.\n\nSo what I came up with was a concept based on immersion, which is probably one of the harder ways to compel someone to keep going.  I wanted the player to feel like they are in the game, and when that immersion is broken, I want them to feel that, recognize it, and be compelled by it.\n\nOK, so the core concept: Playing video games.  By that, I mean, imagine a room / level where there is a TV, a console, and a seat.  The player would turn on the TV, the console, sit down, grab the controller, and start playing.  Visually, you see the screen a bit far away, but big enough.  Some parts have glare from lights and such, just like playing a console as a kid on a tube TV.  The game itself could be anything, but as the player starts to play, and enters a flow state, slowly the TV gets closer.  Slowly the glare starts to fade, and slowly they are sucked into the game until it takes up the entire screen, and the surrounding are lost.\n\nEventually, the player completes the game, learns the concept, and stands up.  Then they realize how much they've been sucked it.  The screen pulls back, the glare returns, their FOV slides back and they return to the normal world, and realize how deep they were.\n\nIt is similar to Accounting, in that layers of immersion type of feel, which I think is also inspired by Inception.\n\nNarrative could be anything, the games themselves could be anything that has flow, and the art style of both the main game, or the sub games could be anything.  But I think the core concept is what would drive people to find the next mini game of sorts, until the final puzzles of the game are the player themselves having to play the game with their own being, instead of in a game, losing that immersion and risking themselves"

bmpnrn,Single player game ideas,"Throw everything you have at me as long as it's single player and not a Dream/Triple A level of complexity.\n\nI'm an beginner/intermediate looking to something to do.\n\nI don't really care if it's 2D or 3D, as long as it fits the first paragraph.\n\nI'm asking this because I've looked at a lot of the top posts of all time and other recent ones in this sub but until nothing has clicked so I need more ideas.\n\nThanks!\n\nPS.: It really has to be single player as I have no idea how to make multiplayer games. (I have a lot of ideas of that type though...)"

bmlk8x,"Earth Guard [Google Play, FREE]",
bmkz66,Stealth game where you play as a Wyvern.,"For those who don't know, a Wyvern is more or less the 'dragon' you see everywhere in games, TV, etc. Where it walks on its wings like a bat. Think Smaug or Drogon.\n\nExcept in this game, the wyverns are much smaller animals, maybe a bit smaller than a cow? Unlike their larger cousins, Dragons, this allows them to be stealthy hunters, relying on their ability to scale walls and ceilings and to quickly fly about. The game would be first person, allowing you to see the perspective of the Wyvern. The player would have to use a mix of speed, stealth and a poisonous bite to succeed.\n\nThe story could go something like; You are a Wyvern mother who has hatchlings to feed, so you go hunting every night for food. One night when you return, human hunters have came and destroyed your nest, hoping to get you, as you occasionally hunt on the main road. And so, you set off for revenge, eventually being captured by an ecotic 'pet' dealer, and sold to a wealthy family in a city. You of course escape, and have to survive in the city. \n\nIt needs refinement, but there's the general idea."
bmiizh,Permadeath MMO with pay-per-life system,"Idea: A simple-looking top-down 2d MMO that is a mix between survival, crafting, and classic MMO tasks. Taking some elements from Ultima Online and Runescape (a variety of skills, combat), and Minicraft/Minecraft (building things block by block, farming, etc.).\n\nThe catch is that your player ages over time, while they build up skills, possessions, property, maybe a house, maybe a family. If you live a less-risky life - your character might live a month, and then die permanently. If you live a risky life, especially PvP, then you might die much sooner. Lives cost real money - something cheap, like $1-5. So effectively it's equivalent to a monthly subscription, except that risky players will play more. If you are killed by PvP without yourself being flagged as a murderer/criminal, then you get credit for a new character.\n\nI think this might be a good way to protect against PvP risk while also generating a little bit of money. Thoughts?"
bmfnql,"An Action/Puzzler where you play Mage/Gunner, who ""loads"" spells into the gun's chambers","Basically, you have a magic gun (which you can aim manually). You load these spells into your gun by putting in a button combination. More powerful spells will not only require a longer button combo, but will also fill up more than one chamber.\n\nThroughout the game you find new spells as well as upgrade your magic gun. Each upgrade will add new chambers to your gun.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs for the ""Puzzle"" element to it.\n\nI think that the game will be made up of traditional puzzles, but you will also fight enemies that need to be defeated in a certain way(Admittedly I haven't put much thought into what this ""certain way"" is), and bosses would be more extreme versions of this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nP.S. There could also be some kind of ""Enchanter"" that can modify specific chambers so that they slightly alter the spell loaded into it."
bmfey3,"A 2D Battle Royale, RPG style game","OK, so my idea is pretty simple. You get a couple of players, scatter them in a large labyrinth, and have them defeat monsters to level up, and then gain skill points that they can then spend on abilities to develop their characters. These abilities could be divided up into three tabs.\n\nOffensive - Defensive - Utility \n\nA player could even spent their points on making their existing abilities more effective.\n\nIf enough time passes, the locations of all players in the labyrinth gets revealed.\n\nOf course, defeating a player would reap much better rewards than a monster, although I'm not sure exactly how much better would be \*too\* much better.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nP.S.: Depending on how a character develops, their appearance could change."
bmc9s8,A single player game where the main mechanic is saving time for use later,So for example the player could press a button to skip the game world forward half a second in time and then later on they could press another button to use up that saved time to slow down time for half a second to make a section easier. This game would need to have constant danger as to prevent the player from farming a large amount of time in safety.
bmbsa0,Lost in Deep Space Horror game,"The game starts out with you on a lightly manned starship, one of the first starships with experimental new warp technology, doing a test flight. But things go horribly wrong. You run the test, the ship starts violently shaking, before rocketing you off at ungodly speeds. Absolutely impossible speeds like before you know it whole galaxies are receding from you. You blackout.\n\nYou awaken, and do a life-sign scan. Everyone died but you. You check The computer for how far you travelled, it froze and stopped counting at around 600 million light years. You obviously have no idea how to get home, you’re just a pilot so you decide you have to find the bodies of the 5 other scientists and find their notes, it’s your only hope of trying to get a solution.\n\nAs you go, out the window the stars start disappearing, until they’re all gone.  Some of the ships walls start to cave in, causing problems and puzzles of things you have to fix. The ship is being enveloped by the main monster of the game, a giant invisible non-corporal entity. It can enter the ship sometimes and you can hear it and see it kick boxes, you have to hide from it. There’s other freaky shit that goes on as well.\n\nThe ending of the game is that you have to communicate with the creature and strike a deal with it, where it’ll carry you home(or maybe to the nearest habitable planet).\n\nI have to admit the beginning part was inspired by an episode of Star Trek TNG. But getting rocketed across an entire universe is such a creepy concept I wanted to explore the scary side of it TNG didn’t cover"
bmabuj,Destructible ads in a Star Fox (SNES) like shooter,"star fox like 3d shooter, flying through the game, and you see ads playing on giant billboards.. which you can blow up\n\nenemy ads that fire lasers at you\n\nBest part - blowing up the ads\n\nHonestly this sounds funner without having the ads inside. also not sure the platforms would allow this kind of crazy interaction with ads\n\nHURDLES\n\nwhat annoys me about mobile ads is you can't just click one and read a short blurb at your leisure, they're always N second long videos or even just animated gifs or something that waste your processor time, take up valuable screen space and slow down everything. Worst of all, they pop up on their own, instead of letting the user choose to ciew them\n\nDestructible ads would need to get past all of those hurdles, to feel smooth and part of the game world\n\nof course the best looking ads would have an advantage over others"
bm7rk7,An idea of VR horror game,"Hi, im totally new to the reddit thing + im not a native english speaker so sorry for any inconviniece :D \n\nI just have thought about the idea of game which will highly depends on human senses, especially sight and sound ( additionally the voice :) ) \n\nSo the basic idea of the game mechanics is there would be two different states of playing the game, starting from ""the sound only"" - there would be no sight just pure black void infront of your eyes unless you make the sound, or surrounding sounds ( maybe some enemies/monsters/ other abominations) that would cause a sound wave ( echolocation thing ya know what i mean) would draw the outlines of everything around you or things that make the sound ( I think if the enemies could hear  your sounds and would be attracted to them would be cool too) and then after some point in the game you would totally lose your hearing senses and slowly start to see, i suppose a game without totally no sound would be boring as hell but there could be some solution for that ( maybe some kind of distorted sounds or different types of static that would change to resemble the sounds ( So that im writing that i think the slow sense loss motive is cool too and may be used for hearing aswell) aditionally after maybe a second switch you would transport to a totally other place that could make the player totally distracted and confused.\n\n Its just a raw thought i got, maybe you can use it somehow\n\nThanks for reading, have a nice day/night guys :D \~Anderido"
bm79kz,A fantasy fishing game where you fish bigger and crazier creatures the better you get,"I've wanted to play this game for a LONG, long time. Nothing quite scratches the itch I imagine this game would scratch.\n\nAs the title explains, you're a budding fisherman with a shitty stick rod and a rotting wooden boat. When you start fishing, you can't really go too deep or catch anything too big without it being next to impossible to catch, but the more you catch, the more you can sell to the local vendor, the more you can upgrade your rod, your boat, your equipment, and consumables that give you buffs. You start by only really being able to catch goldfish and garbage, but eventually, you will progress to the point where you are able to catch huge lovecraftian sea creatures and other unreal shit.\nNight fishing is a different ballpark, the fish become significantly harder and more creepy, you get huge glow in the dark anglers, evil looking octopuses, stuff like that. They give significantly more $$$ and XP for catching, at the downside that you'll have stamina debuffs from not sleeping.\n\nThat's right, you need to keep your stamina up by eating some of the fish you catch! When you catch a fish, you get three options; eat it for rare buffs &amp; stamina gains, sell it to the vendor for money, or use it as bait for a better chance at catching rarer fish.\n\nCatching fish would be like from a POV perspective. As you cast the rod, your camera follows the bobber as it goes deeper into the ocean. The better rod you have, the deeper you can go, the faster you can go, the more hits you can take from other fish before your rod velocity reaches 0, the better rods you can steer them or explode fish in your way, other stuff like that. When you attract a fish, you have to do a QTE as soon as the fish bites which activates the bobber in different ways. The regular ones will just be you pulling them back up, but the more upgraded bobbers might eject spikes into the fish's mouth to impale them, or deploy a huge net around them. These have different advantages and negatives to using for different fish. Once you've caught the fish you need to spam spacebar (you can buy upgrades that automate this later) to reel your fish in. You move your mouse counter to whatever direction the fish is struggling in, and maybe do other shit too. The bigger fish are REALLY furious and it takes a lot of accuracy and hard work to catch. But when you catch it, it flies into the air and you get a satisfying screen that tells you how big the fish is and its name.\n\nYou get XP for catching fish. The more XP, the better you get. You can put your upgrade points into strength (makes counter-steering fish easier), perception (gives you more slowdown time), stamina (lets you catch more fish before you need to sleep), stuff like that. The vendors sell better rod upgrades, cooler boats, better apparel (small buffs but mainly to make you look cool), some low-level bait, consumable items that give you buffs, etc. The more money you put into the local shops, the better stuff you get. Vendors also have a quest board where you can fulfil bounties and timed catch requests for money.\n\nThe endgame is catching a huge, cthulu-tier sea creature at night. This thing should be insane, and if you catch it, you get 3 options:\n1. You sell the fish to the vendors. They're so impressed that they sell everything to you for the fish, you become a capitalist success and make your own fishing lodge for new fishers. The end.\n2. You eat the fish and it imbues you with godlike fish powers, and you ascend to become a fish GOD (like the slug ending in bloodborne yo)\n3. You use the fish as BAIT. This unlocks NG+. As you reach the bottom of the ocean with the fish as bait, the sea floor opens up, and you get pulled straight into the wormhole from your rod. This is some castlevania symphony of the night type shit. You enter a mirror world where all of the fish are fucking INSANE CORRUPTED VERSIONS of what you already caught. The vendors are all undead fish people, and you can breathe underwater. You become the bait, and you have to jump into the ocean and FUCKING FIGHT THE FISH you're trying to catch, god of war type shit.\n\nSo yeah, that's all i've got. I wish a game like this existed."
bm646d,TakeCover,A game where you hide underneath a dome shield that you can build and upgrade. Then a friend or you yourself press a button and have all sorts of different bombs fall on you to see if you can withstand the blast. Doesn't have to just be bombs either could be all sorts of projectiles launched in various ways. \n\nI've had this idea for a very long time.
bm5b1z,SunnyDays,"A game where you have great atmospheric music and enjoy your time in a world where you can craft anything and do anything. I dont know why but clearing weeds in an overgrown forest to build a house just sounds so relaxing to me. There could be any biome really. (Basically minecraft 2.0). But Much more realistic. Games like The Forest, Heat, Ark, 7days to die, the hunter call of the wild, and stranded deep are all in my head when I think of this game. \n\nYou could dig underground tunnels, build realistic fences and walls, irrigation systems, many different types of houses, which you could build from the environment around you. \n\nA lot of games focus on crafting and survival but they don't go into depth like this game could. I only have some Java script and HTML programming, was hoping someone would see this post and think this might work."

bm2l3w,A game about managing a shop,"The core idea is that you are the owner and operator of a store. The player can choose different types and sizes of stores to run, though they will be fairly limited at the start of the game. \n\n**Concept**\n\nThe shop is shown from a top-down perspective. The game is shown as a series of shelves, along with a checkout and the front doors. The player can designate items to go on each shelf for the customers to buy and you can only have a certain amount of items on a shelf based on their size. \n\nThe player starts with what is essentially a giant room to build their shop into. They will need to designate a front and back, with the front containing shelves and checkouts and the back containing storage for items. They will also need to build front doors, doors between the front and the back, and a delivery area for trucks to deliver items to the shop. I could see it as similar to Megaquarium where the player can buy new space to allow for more front and back room.\n\nCustomers are sorted into direct shoppers - who come in looking for a specific item/s, buy them, and leave - and browsers - who come in and look for things they might want, buy a few things and leave. Customers have a confidence level that is pre-generated. Customers with low confidence will go to a staff member to ask where an item is, which then raises their confidence level. Repeat customers have higher confidence each time and generally don't need to ask for help unless there are changes in the location of things they want to buy. \n\nTo keep the shelves stocked at all times, the player is responsible for ordering new stock to replace sold stock. Stock comes on the second night after ordering the stock, though a rush order can be made at a higher cost which arrives that night. The player will need to keep in mind when ordering things that they will only have a certain amount of storage space, so if their offered items are too diverse they may find they are constantly running out of certain in-demand items. The items that are in demand could change each season to create more of a challenge. \n\nTo stock the shelves, clean the store, run the checkout, and help customers, the players must hire staff. The staff have skills along the lines of stocking, cleaning, ordering, conscientiousness, checkout, and customer service that have ranks from 1 to 10. Stocking, cleaning, checkout, and customer service are basic skills. Conscientiousness and ordering are advanced skills. Skill progress is gained by the staff member engaging in the skill in question, meaning that you will need to make sure the staff member's job is varied to lead to well-rounded skills. I'll detail the skills below. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Stocking (Basic Skill - No Requirements)*\n\nThis determines the speed at which the staff member can move with items, how quickly they can stock shelves, and how many shelves they can manage. \n\n*Cleaning (Basic Skill - No Requirements)*\n\nThis determines how fast a staff member can clean up dirt and grime, how quickly they can tidy a spilled item, and how quickly they react to spills and grime.\n\n*Checkout (Basic Skill - No Requirements)*\n\nThis determines how quickly a staff member can scan items, how quickly they can bag the items, and how quickly they process the final sale - reducing potential line wait times. \n\n*Customer Service (Basic Skill - No Requirements)*\n\nThis determines how well the staff member interacts with customers and how quickly they can take a customer to find the item they want. \n\n*Conscientiousness (Advanced Skill - 5 Cleaning &amp; 5 Customer Service)*\n\nThis determines the staff members overall effectiveness. Staff members with high conscientiousness stock faster, clean faster, move faster, checkout faster, and are more proactive about their job. \n\n*Ordering (Advanced Skill - 5 Stocking &amp; 5 Checkout)*\n\nThis allows a staff member to recommend ordering new products that have low stock. They will note when the stock in the back is running low and affix a tag to it that the player can see and then order. The level of the skill determines how quickly the tag is affixed and how many tags can be affixed at once. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis game represents more of a simulation experience, rather than a more active strategy experience. You could have many different potential stores with potentially hundreds of different items over time. This would be a game well-suited for Steam Early Access to give the developer time to add all the different items and store types."

blykn6,Hide and seek for the modern age,"Remember playing hide and seek with your childhood friends? This would be a spin-off of that. \n\nIt's assic hide and seek but you use your phones for power ups. Everyone joins a ""lobby"" and a seeker is decided by rng. Then the hiders go hide. Now, the seeker would have powerups they could use like ping where using GPS a little ping bubble pops up showing them the position of one of the hiders. Also, an alarm where when you activate it one of the hiders phones makes a loud beeping. \n\nThe seekers could have powers like fake their location or jam the signal or even expose other hiders. \n\nI think I would be able to make this, but I'm not exactly sure if it's even a good idea. \n\nThoughts?"
blxaz0,RPG set in ancient mythological Greece,"I would love to play a game where you start off as a Demi-god of your choosing, with branching skill trees depending on whether your father or mother is a god of Olympus. There is a wealth of amazing and bizarre stories to include; the player could follow Hercules in his trials, join Jason and the argonauts, follow oedipus and his pretty unsettling fate or phaeton and his train wreck of a driving attempt. \nIn terms of feel, I would love a third or first person perspective, with a freedom akin to Witcher or Skyrim. It would be very ambitious, but you could make the world smaller and really polish and pack it with content. You could include all sorts of mythical beasts, terrorising towns, and follow a personal quest of some kind. It would be awesome if you had to actually fear offending the gods, with a mechanic that causes you to have some pretty terrible luck if you get on their wrong side. It would mean a weight to your decisions, and how to minimise impact on the gods and what that would mean for your future. \nI know people might mention Assassin’s creed odyssey, but my understanding is that that game is quite different to what I describe here. What do you think?"
blw0of,Zombie survival multiplayer game FPS,"# 1. General description\n\n\-  Game type : FPS \n\n\-  Mode : multi-player\n\n\-  Environment : survivalhorror\n\n\-  Style : arcade \n\n\-  Platform : PC (consoles ?)\n\n\-  Engine : UE4 ? Unity ?\n\n\-  Number of players : 8 minimum, as many as possible ideally (100 and more ?)\n\n\- PEGI : 18 \n\n# 2. Synopsis\n\nThe player incarnates a survivor into a post-apocalyptic world who must defend himself against other survivors and against zombie hordes controlled by artificial intelligence but also controlled by other players. \n\nThe survivors must buy weapons and other accessories with virtual money (Z-coins) in order to defend themselves against zombies and enemy survivors.\n\nThe players infected by zombie bites eventually turn into a zombie themselves and join the zombie team. They still can try to win the game this time by infecting all remaining survivors. \n\n# 3. Game modes, goals and rules\n\n#  3.1 Deathmatch\n\n\-  **Pre-game :**\n\no One player creates a game, defines an entering price in Z-coins for the pre-game bet (detailled in a further chapter) and invites other players to join.\n\no The game starts when the number of players needed is reached.\n\no The players buy their initial weapons and gear just before the game starts.\n\n\- **Beginning of the game :**\n\no  The survivors are randomly disposed onto their respawn area located on the edges of the map.\n\no  A first zombie controlled by artificial intelligence (AI-zombie) spawns at the same time at the center of the map and will immediately move towards the closest survivor to attack him. \n\no  A zombie bite removes a certain amount of health and one single bite leads to an irreversible contamination. Once infected, the survivor will then progressively and inevitably lose all of his health until he dies and then turn into a zombie-player.\n\no Every AI-zombie eliminated by a survivor will leave a Z-coin on his body which any survivor can pick up. A zombie-player eliminated will leave  100 Z-coins on his body.\n\n\- **Following :**\n\no  Every AI-zombie eliminated will then immediately give birth to two other new AI-zombies in the zombie respawn area located between the edges and the center of the map. The number of AI-zombies will then constantelly grow as survivors eliminate more AI-zombies and so on. \n\no  The survivors can also eliminate other survivor players in order to steal their gear and the Z-coins they have collected during the game.\n\no  Once eliminated, the survivor loses all of his weapons and gear but also all the Z-coins in his possession. He can then buy new weapons and gear from his Z-coin account before respawning again on the edges of the map. He can die and respawn as a survivor on and on as long as he has not been infected.\n\no  Once infected, the survivor who eventually dies no mather how will than rescurrect as a zombie-player.\n\no  The zombie-player must try to infect all the reamaining survivors if he wants to win the game as part of the zombie team.\n\no  Every time a zombie-player is eliminated, he respawns in the zombie respawning zone between the edges and the center of the map. \n\no  Every time a new infected survivor joins the zombie team, all the previous zombie-players get 100 Z-coins. If they manage to win the game in the end, they will then keep the whole amount as a reward.\n\no  The number of AI-zombies keep growing on and on as long as half of the survivors hasn’t been infected and turned into zombies.\n\n\- **End of the game :**\n\no  Once half of the survivors have been turned into zombies, every AI-zombie eliminated no longer respawns. The zombie-players on the other hand will keep on respawning as long as there are AI-zombies remaining on the map. \n\no  Once that all the AI-zombies have been eliminated, every zombie-player eliminated no longer respawns either.\n\no  The survivors win if they manage to eliminated all the AI-zombies, all the zombie-players and all the infected survivors from the map (an infected survivor is considered part of the zombie team).\n\no  The zombies win if they manage to infect and turn all the survivors into zombies.\n\no  If the survivors win, each player keeps the Z-coins collected in his possession plus his share of the total pre-game bet from the beginning which is divided by the number of remaining survivors.\n\no If the zombies win, each zombie-player keeps his Z-coins collected as a zombie and take back his pre-game bet from the beginning. \n\n# 3.2. Escape\n\nIn the Escape mode, the survivors must try to evacuate the map through an helicopter which of course does not have enough room for everyone. The Escape mode begins exactly the same way as Deathmatch excepted that once half of the survivors have turned into zombies, the AI-zombies and the zombie-players keep respawning after being eliminated but AI-zombies no longer grow in numbers. At the same time, the helicopter arrives over the top of a random building on the map. The remaining half of the survivors must now reach the helicopter to win the game. The problem is that the helicopter has only enough room for half of the remaining survivors (only one quarter of the total number of survivors who started the game). \n\nThe game ends when the helicopter leaves either because it is filled with the maximum number of survivors or because there are no more survivors alive left to rescue. An infected survivor is unable to enter the helicopter and is considered part of the zombie team even before he turns. The survivors who managed to reach the helicopter keep their Z-coins collected during the game and equally share the whole pre-game bet as a reward. \n\nThe zombie-players win the game and have their pre-game bet part back if they manage to infect all survivors before anyone of them reaches the helicopter. If they lose, however, they are still able to keep the Z-coins collected during the game as zombies in order to encourage the zombie players not to quit the game before the end. \n\n# 4. Real money and virtual money\n\nThe virtual money (Z-coins) is needed in order to buy weapons and accessories during the game. Every player owns an account where he can deposit or whithdraw his virtual money. During the game, the survivors can buy some new gear before respawning but not while playing. Survivors cannot deposit money on their account while playing either. \n\nThe virtual money can be gained through different ways :\n\n\- « Buying » virtual money with real money. \n\nThe number of Z-coins gained by paying with real money is equal to the amount spent in euros cubed.\n\nFor example : 1 euro = 1x1x1 = 1 Z-coin. 10 euros = 10x10X10 = 1000 Z-coins. 100 euros = 100x100x100 = 1 000 000 Z-coins and so on.\n\n\- Collecting Z-coins in game :\n\no  The survivors can pick up Z-coins left by zombies on their dead bodies once they are killed. \n\nA dead AI-zombie will leave 1 Z-coin on his body and a dead zombie-player will leave 100 Z-coins on its body. \n\nHowever, when a survivor gets killed by another survivor or if he turns into a zombie he will lose all the Z-coins he previously collected as well as the gear he had bought and/or collected until then, leaving it all available to be stealed by other players. \n\no  The zombie-players already part of the zombie team will gain 100 Z-coins every time a new zombie-player joins the zombie team. Meaning that on a 100 players game won by the zombie team, the first player to turn into a zombie will gain 10.000 Z-coins and the last player to be transformed will gain 100 Z-coins. \n\n\-  Betting Z-coins pre-game :\n\no The player who creates the games freely determines an entering price in Z-coin that every player must pay to be allowed to join, including himself. The total amount of virtual money will constitue the pre-game bet.\n\no If survivors win, they equally share the total amount of pre-game bet divided by the number of remaining survivors. If zombies win, each of them takes his personnal initial bet back (corresponding to the game entering price).\n\n# 5. The maps\n\nGeneral design :\n\n\-  A central devastated urbanised zone where survivors can better protect themselves inside the ruins. \n\n\-  A wild zone made of forests or swamps around the central zone which will also be the the respawn area for all zombies, players and AI. \n\n\- The edges of the map will be delimited by freeways and abandonned cars corresponding to the survivors’ respawn area. \n\nThe freedom of travelling through the entire map can be improved by creating a torus/donut shaped world whith no invisible walls. The players will then be able to directly cross the edges of the map from one side to the opposite without interruption or obstacles. \n\n# 6. The characters\n\n\- **Survivors :**\n\nThe survivors are human characters controlled by players. Their goal is to end the game alive without being infected while collecting as much money as they can at the same time. \n\nThe survivors have some physical skills determined by their remaining amount of health :\n\n\-  Between 75 and 100 points of health :\n\no Automatic health regeneration of 1 point per minute up to 100\n\no Ability to sprint during 20 seconds and make long jumps\n\no Ability to run at moderate speed without limit of time\n\no Ability to use aim down sight with heavy weapons\n\no Ability to hold a medium firearm in each arm for hip aim\n\n\-  Between 50 and 75 points of health :\n\no No more automatic health regeneration\n\no No more possibility to sprint but still possible to run at moderate speed for 20 seconds, walk at normal speed and make short jumps. \n\no Aim down sight can no longer be used for heavy weapons which can still be hip fired.   \n\no No more possibility to hold a medium weapon in both hands but still work with two handguns.\n\n\- Between 25 and 50 points of health :\n\no Still able to walk at normal speed for 20 seconds and walk slowly with a limp the rest of the time\n\no Can no longer use a heavy weapon by any means\n\no Can no longer aim down sight with a medium weapon which can still be hip fired\n\no Still able to aim down sight with a handgun\n\no Can no longer use a handgun in both hands\n\n\-  Between 0 and 25 points of health :\n\no Health automatically decreases by 1 point every minute until death\n\no Walking is no longer possible, crawling becomes the only way to move\n\no No possibility to use a heavy or medium weapon by any means\n\no Hip fire with a handgun is still possible\n\nA survivor begins with 100 points of health every time he respawns and he will lose more points of health when he gets hit in the weaker parts of his body. \n\n\-  Damage potential by body parts :\n\no Head : 100%\n\no Chest : 66%\n\no Abdomen : 33%\n\no Thigh : 25%\n\no Legs and arms : 10%\n\nSurvivors lose 1 point of health every minute until they die once they are infected.\n\n\- **AI-zombies :**\n\nAI-zombies are controlled by artificial intellingence. They are automatically aimed to attack the closest survivor to them on the map as soon as they respawn. \n\nThey have exactly the same amount of health and the same damage potential by body parts than survivors. They move at survivors’ moderate running speed.\n\nA zombie-AI bite will remove 10 points of health from a survivor’s health and will infect him irreversibly. The infected survivor will then progressively lose all his health until he dies before turning into a zombie. \n\n\- **Zombie-players :**\n\nThe zombie-players are controlled by a player who was a survivor before dying previously infected by a zombie bite.\n\nZombie-players have a superior amount of health of 200 points but the same damage potential by body parts.\n\nThey are able to climb on walls and ceilings.\n\nThey can sprint permanantly without need to rest.\n\nTheir health progressively regenerates up to 200 as long as it has not fallen to zero.\n\nOn the other hand, they have 15 minutes to attack a survivor before their health starts to decline until they die.\n\nZombie-players have a natural radar to track survivors and a special vision to see them through walls.\n\nA zombie-player bite costs 20 points of health to a survivor and infects him irreversibly, making him lose 2 points of health every minute until he dies.\n\n# 7.

Conclusion\n\nThe beginning of a game is pretty similar to a regular multiplayer deathmatch where players will confront each other in a guerilla atmosphere between sniper duels and bloody ambushes. The winners of those first combats will earn the privilege to loot their opponents’ equipment in order to constitute a precious stock to help them face the following events. \n\nMeanwhile, the first zombie controlled by AI will start to attack the survivors before being joined by the rest of the growing horde as one zombie killed will instantly give birth to two new other zombies. \n\nSurvivors will further tend to retreat inside the ruins of the central zone, progressively switching to weapons more efficient in close combat, especially when ammo will start to run dry. \n\nTension will then rise in intensity to reach its climax when half of the survivors will be turned into zombies and it won’t fall until the remaining survivors eliminate definitely all the zombies on the map... If they ever succeed to do so.\n\nThe gaming experience also gets a lot more interesting when it comes to deal with conflictual interests. While playing survivor, getting your opponents infected as soon as possible will minimise the number of AI-zombies to eliminate at the end of the game and thus increasing your chances to win. On the other hand, sparing other players and teaming up with them insures a better protection against hostile groups rather than remaining isolated. \n\nTurns out that joining the zombie team at an early stage also leads to more gains in case of a zombie win. However, switching to the zombie team too quickly will make victory more difficult as the AI-zombie horde wil be less numerous and easier for survivors to take down.\n\nIn other words, the longer survivors will resist before half of them turn into zombies, the harder it will be for them to keep on resisting afterwards in order to win the game."

bloz1q,"Open-world RPG with many twists, complex characters and rich thoughtful story about the future of human race and Earth","Hi, \nI was just thinking about a story which would include sci-fi elements, world problems, the future of humanity etc. and I came up with this.\n\nFirst there was this Cyberpunk World(CPW) which escalated just as it could irl. Pollution,overpopulation, climatic changes, plastics everywhere, people not caring about anything but money and wealth. \n\nThen a guy steps in but he looks like the villain. He wants to extinct most of the humanity and start a new world, better than this and to try to live in harmony with the Earth by using clean energy and safe technologies.\n\nAlso the CPW world has some hero-like people who want to prevent this and ""save all the people"". But they will eventually fail and most of them will die.\nThe ""villain"" will win, starting a New World(ANW).\n\nThere will be people who joined him and also those who were already born in the new world. They would live on Earth, but in a newly discovered land. Everyone would be happy and everythink would work.\n\nBut some CPW people survived, some heroes too.\nAnd they formed 3 factions+ANW faction, so 4 in total.\nThey all want to somehow destroy ANW and then:\n1st wants to rebuild the CPW, as the old world. Back to everything we had.\n2nd wants to leave Earth and find a new home.\n3rd wants to destroy everything and let the Earth to fix itself.\n4th wants to protect ANW and defeat those who is a threat.\n\nThe player would start after this and could choose to start either in ANW or the destroyed CPW. And as they would progress in the story they could choose their faction after learning about every of them and then try to fulfill their goal.\n\nIt would play like Fallout New Vegas/Outer Worlds or could be mixed with some Deus Ex elements.\n\n\nI haven't thought about every detail and motivation in-depth, it is just a rough sketch but I would like to hear and read about your opinions."

agyjuz,A Godsim RTS With a High Emphasis on Morality (Think Black and White),"This is gonna be a long one, so strap in. I don't expect this game to be made, but I was just daydreaming about this and I'd like to share it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Overview:** In this game, you're a god of a village of people, in a land with many villages and cultures. Your goal is to become the supreme deity via one of three victory conditions:\n\n**Piety Victory:** All villages in the map adopt your religion. A village converts to your religion when more than 50% of its villagers worship you. This is done by causing ""awe"" among villagers. \n\n**Military Victory:** All other gods have been eliminated from the game via military conquest.\n\n**Population Victory:** More than 50% of the total population in the map live in your original village. This can be achieved by growing your population through breeding or causing migrations. Migrations happen when the ""appeal"" of your original village is high enough relative to the home village of migrating villagers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Villagers:** These are the primary resource of the game. Each villager requires food, and has a health meter. When that reaches zero, they die. They can also die of old age and disease. You need villagers to build, reproduce, collect resources, worship, join armies, and ultimately win the game. \n\n**Worshipers**: Only villagers sufficiently awed by you count as your worshipers. Only they will worship, but other villagers in villagers that follow your religion will still collect resources, breed, build, and fight for your people.\n\n**Influence:** You can interact with villagers in several ways. You can move them around (placing them next to some objects will cause ""inspirations"", which makes them act in certain ways with more vigor. For example, placing someone next to someone of the opposite sex will be inspired to have babies with them. Placing someone next to a farm will make them farm hard), instruct them to build certain buildings (otherwise, they'll build automatically), and send them to war. These cost influence points, which build up gradually based on the number of worshipers you have, or with quests.\n\n**Buildings:** The game features several buildings with different purposes. Critical ones include town centers, temples, conscription centers, resource collection buildings, housing, and resource centers, which contain food, wood, and ore. They require wood and ore to build. Generally, villagers will go about constructing them automatically, but can be instructed to build certain ones at the cost of influence. Buildings are unlocked through the game.\n\n**Appeal:** Buildings and the environment contribute to the appeal of your village. When the appeal of your village is high enough relative to the appeal of other villages, this can cause migrations. This is crucial to obtaining a Pop victory.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Morality:** Most of the actions you take in the game have an alignment to them. Harming or killing people, animals, and the environment are considered evil, while any action that helps people is good. Your overall alignment has an effect on aesthetics. A good god's realm will have flowers and sunshine, while a bad god's will be fire and brimstone. But more importantly, it has an effect on some of the miracles you can cast, and the practices of your faithful.\n\n**Practices:** Based on the alignment of your actions, your people will develop practices spontaneously (via some RNG). Good acts inspire good practices, such as faith healing (spontaneous heals), food sharing (decrease to food consumption), fun services (worshipers spend more time in temples), etc. Bad practices include things like human sacrifices, forced labor (buffs to recourse extraction), and holy war (buffs to army morale).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Miracles:** Miracles are the biggest way in which you influence the world. They're divided into 4 categories (air, water, fire, earth), and can be used for a whole bunch of things. The more you cast spells in each category, the more experience you get, unlocking more powerful spells. Casting spells near to villagers causes ""awe"", making them more likely to worship you.\n\n**Prayer Power (Mana):** This is the resource you need to cast miracles. More powerful spells take more PP. PP is generated when worshipers worship at temples, which they do spontaneously. You can also inspire them to worship by planting them next to temples. \n\n**The Realm:** You can only cast miracles in an area called your ""realm"". This an area determined by the number of villagers in your villages, around the city center. However, some miracles, such as fireballs, can be thrown from your realm to outside it.\n\n**Epic Miracles:** These are super powerful miracles that can be cast outside your realm. You gain access to them when you master a certain element. Each element has two epic miracles, that you gain access to depending on your alignment. For example, if you're a good god and master Earth, you'll be able to cast Abundance (which is a massive resource spell for food, wood, and ore). If you're a bad god and master Earth, you can cast an Earthquake.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Military:** Combat in this game is relatively basic and outside your control. After a conscription center is built in a village, it can levy a certain amount of its population for the military (20% for offensive operations, and 40% for defensive ones). Levying is automatic when your realm is attacked, and can also happen when you direct your people to war. Armies move and fight independently, but you do start wars by targeting opposing areas. Armies fight for as long as morale lasts, which in turn is affected by relative army strengths, casualties, miracles, and Avatar presence. When an army morale is depleted, survivors flee and return to their homes where they become civilians again. \n\n**Conquest:** In an offensive operation, an army aims to eventually destroy a town center. When you destroy the town center of an opposing god's original town, they lose. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Avatar:** Finally, there is the Avatar, your living representative of your power on the planet. This is a powerful person capable of casting miracles, boosting prayer power generation, resource collection, and combat (where s/he counts as a hero unit with extra hp). The Avatar can die, but reincarnates infinitely. You can move your Avatar around without any influence points. The Avatar has his/her own alignment, based on his/her actions. You can teach him/her miracles by performing them in front of him/her. You can also encourage/discourage certain behavior by inspiring him/her, performing happiness miracles on him/her when s/he does something you like, or by hurting him/her when s/he does something you don't like. The Avatar is particularly important for Piety victories, as s/he can be sent to perform miracles in villages outside your realm while you cannot. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's the basic outline. Hope it's a fun read, and that it inspires some fun discussion."
agumpz,Two weeks to take over the world.,"You are a artificial intelligence contained within self-replicating microchip brain-implant. You have been cast down into an alternate universe in an act of banishment. It appears to be a mild-fantasy medieval era world. You have two weeks to take over enough people that taking over the rest is easy, so you can utilize the entire world population to work on a way back. Your strength is in your strategy and your numbers, so it would do you well to use those strengths to win. If the opposing armies coming after you eradicate you, you lose. If you do not succeed in two weeks, an assault designed to be unwinnable will occur upon you, resulting in game over.\n\n&amp;#x200B;"
agucgi,A scratch-style drag and drop programming language for vr.,"Example: You create an event that, when the trigger on the vive wand is held, will create a fireball in your hand (could be made in tilt brush or something similar and imported), and when released it could be thrown. from there you could add more events to add more complex functions such as chaining color, size direction, and trigger options all within the game. (I probably explained that terribly, but essentially just programmable and customisable particle effect creator for vr)"
agtv8p,So I found this OST for a game called Comic Bakery. But I misread it as Cosmic Bakery.,"Thing is, the music seems more fitting for if the name was Cosmic Bakery, and if the game was space themed. It's not. The music is wasted on a game, that quite frankly, is rather bad. However!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis [OST](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nf29ShkoAiA) makes me think of a pixelated epic silly bakery themed adventure.\n\nI humbly request that someone takes inspiration from this ost and uses it to their fullest extent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;"
