ka28ut,Gilgamesh is the great hero chosen by date to defeat the dark wizard and free the realm... You're just there to carry all his crap,"I had this idea for Wizard jam based off of the Idle Thumbs episode ""I can't do it, Gilgamesh!"" but then I started a real job...\n\nLike the title suggests the basic premise of the game is you are the squires (think Holy Grail style with a massive heavy backpack) to Gilgamesh the mighty hero of the land (think Captain Hammer in platemail).\n\nAs you progress the hero collects a wide variety of items all of which you are expected to carry. The more you carry the heavier your bag is and the harder it will be to keep up. He will collect things ranging like key items needed to unlock puzzles, valuables to sell in the next town, or things he needs for a fetch quest. That said, he also insists on collecting trinkets for ""completion"".\n\nAs a squire you have four jobs:\n* Carry his stuff\n* Give/toss him items when he needs them\n* Stay in his good graces\n* Try not to die\n\nIf he gets ahead of you he'll get impatient and his opinion of you will drop. If you keep up and give him the stuff he needs his opinion of you will rise. Helping him collect trinkets or complete fetch quest will also boost his opinion of you but then things become more difficult. You can ask him not to pick up so much junk on your next journey but you rush him getting mad at you.\n\nIf he gets mad enough you'll get fired. You lose any stats and equipment you gained. If you die on a journey the hero has to backtrack with his pack to the last town and hire a new squire. He may decide ditch some of the equipment along the way if it's too heavy.\n\nA new squire isn't the end of the world, you take on the role of that squire and continue the journey. If the hero fire though, that is the end of the world. He'll take damage as he fights monsters, when you give him the wrong item, and when you fail to get him what he needs in time.\n\n\nRougelike 2D puzzle platformer"
ka03kv,The NYC teen experience,"I have no clue if this is the status quo but I have had some of the most surreal and craziest experiences as a teen growing up in New York City. The amount of stories that could go into a game about this experience from not just me but people that I know could create a modern fable. They would be stories inspired by real events which by themselves involve guns, drugs, sex, and violence all in the most important urban center of our time. I’ve been thinking about this as cyberpunk 2077 comes out because it reminds me of a futuristic version of my city. I’m an inspiring game developer and I pray that I will get the chance to make this. \nIf you drop woo don’t respond to this. \nRip pop smoke"
k9zggc,A No guns game,"The Story would be something like, a hitman sort of thing, a character that involves killing, with you being them, you have no weapons, but you can take the environment and use it as a weapon, the game could have separate loadouts, but you still have no weapons.. and in comes, buffs.. Your character just so happens to know how to make drugs, and where to buy them, certain areas, if you buy too much, can be ambushed, or run out of stock, with these drugs you can change the tide of the area, with drugs that enhance player speed, or damage resistance, and the more you play, and the more stuff you grab from the area, the more stuff you can make, then, comes the upgrades, upgrades allow you to increase certain parts of your character, allowing you to carry more melee weapons, more drugs, or even make you stronger or lighter, your choice, but remember, you don't have guns, they do, so choose wisely what you shall do"
k9yo5i,Russian Roulette the video game,A game about competitively shooting yourself in the head.\n\n* Online or local players\n* Chat with other players at table before you pull the trigger\n* Choose the angle of your gun when you pull the trigger \n* Online or local audience\n* Permadeath\n* If you're dead you can only watch games as a ghost... forever.\n* Audience and participants can bet points. Ghosts may still bet points.\n* Audience have a separate chat room to talk\n* Points can only be used for silly things like hats or clothes. Maybe special items which reduce chance of gun going off by 0.00000000001%. I dunno.
k9wrgi,A tag game .. But with guns,"So it's an FPS game of about 5 players .. And a verity of maps .. With lots of hiding places ... And even that there is guns .. There will be no killing so it is family friendly .. The guns are more of nerf guns than real ones .. Anyway ... At the beginning of the round .. one of the players will randomly have the label ""it"" and when the round starts .. They gonna have to shoot some one else .. To transfer the label ""it"" to them .. So it's like tag .. And there will be a bunch of timers .. Mainly 3 .. One will be to time the round which will be optional (so you can choose to play for 5 minutes or ten or 15 ... Etc) and an ""it"" timer for each player .. Where it records how long they've been ""it"" during the round .. And the final timer is also for each player .. And this one is to encourage moving around more then hiding in one spot (like the storm or the zone in fortnite and pubg) where there will be a timer of about 10 secondes .. Where if you didn't move for 10 secondes and stayed in one place .. You going to be visible to who ever is ""it"" even behind walls (much like wallhack) .. But after they move to a diffrent spot that timer resets .. At the end of the round .. The player with the least amount of time being ""it"" .. Will be declared number one and the winner .. And the rest will rank below the winner .. While the one with the most time being ""it"" is last ... I am thinking maybe the ""bullets"" should be a bit slow .. So the other players will have time to react to them .. And also .. maybe add dodging skills to avoid the bullets .. to make for awsome clutch moments .. Let me know what you guys think of this"
k9v1sr,Anime Fighting Game,"As games get more advanced, fighting games are slowly dying, so my idea is to have a Mortal Kombat base with all characters in a kinda anime-chibi style so it brings out a contrast with cute, and deadly.\n\nThe goal is to basically kill or knock out opponent, there should be possibly between 8-20 characters, but less is fine since I know it is hard on devs.\n\nSecret characters would be cool, but not needed. The fighting style would be super bloody (not gory) since it is extra work for a small result, and the blood add to the contrast of cute but deadly.\n\nPlatforms I really dont know it's up to the devs\n\n\nI would like credit for the idea, and if you use it I would like to see how it turned out since I think it will be cool."
k9us6b,"A platformer game where you play as a ball of fire, and your surroundings is a frozen wasteland and if you stay in one spot for long enough it will melt the ice, but if you stay for too long it will burn what is underneath the ice, the objective is to defrost all the levels without burning them.","Feel free to use my idea, just give credit please"

k9s4d6,2d Railroad Game,"Hello everyone,\n\nI had an ideal for a 2d top down resource management game somewhat similar in style to Stardew Valley. \n\nThe basic story of the game is you inherit a dying railroad from an estranged family member. This railroad is on an island that at one point had been the industrial center for your country but had slowly withered away over the decades, but now due to outside circumstances it is reviving and your right in the middle of it.\n\nThe game would start with you creating your character and coming to the island, there you would find the railroad in horrible condition and the only engine available to you broke down before you arrived. To save the railroad you would have to go all over town asking everyone for help in getting parts or knowledge to repair the engine. \n\nOnce you repair the engine the main game begins. Here you have daily tasks you can do such as; shunting cars, scheduling pickups and deliveries, hitting new employees, etc. You would also have tasks for the community like donating to the school or something that you could do. \n\nThe goal of all this is to earn enough money and repair the railroad. Eventually you would be able to expand and upgrade the railroad, buying new locomotives, getting new cars, opening new tracks, and getting new clients. Eventually I'd hope to add more towns that you could expand into. \n\nI'd like to know what you all think, and if you have any comments, criticism, or questions. I doubt I'd ever get it to fruition as my technical skills are greatly lacking, it's still fun thinking about it."

k9qlgk,A typical Tower Defense Game but attackers are also human players,"Actually, this game is very similar to League of Legends. The difference is that one defender sets up his defense layout according to the coins in his hand, just like a typical tower defense game. After finishing the plan and clicking ""start wave"", other players try to get past the defense by directing a hero just like LoL."
k9mk9a,Long term stealth mechanic,"Stealth mechanics for a lot of the games I have played tend to feel a little awkward in my experience so I came up with this:\n\nWhen you start the game the player shouldn't be a master of stealth. But, you can't exactly just have the enemy just flip around like they knew the player was there the entire time whenever the player tries a takedown. You gotta let the player feel as if they had a hand in it. So, how about instead of a percentage chance of the enemy noticing the player or something, a quick time event, or precise controls are involved? Could be a combination of both. The player feels as though they can in fact do the stealth takedowns but, as the character is still new at it, they aren't experts. \n\nAs the game progresses, and if the player chooses to focus more on the stealth area, maybe have perks they could get that involve making the stealth easier. More time to do the quick time events, quieting the enemy faster, the controls have to be less precise, so on. Higher levels may be able to do take downs by pressing 1 button for a much quicker takedown. Even higher levels may be able to gain buffs per stealth takedown, for example faster movement speed for say, 3 seconds. You could even add in a timed event where the player could grab the knife from the enemy they just took down to throw at another enemy for a dual takedown. It really would just depend on how the dev implements it."
k9lrc4,"A new idea for how armor works universally, no damage-type/element/perk type of gimmicks.","Armor stat function seems to be only affected by specific gimmicks, such as elements or damage types, but nothing related to just the base function of direct damage. Shields in most games are a layer on top of heath that regenerates and cannot lead to killing without damaging health. Health is what needs to be depleted to defeat an opponent. I never understood what the point of armor was aside from hiding more health. Suddenly, I got an idea on how damage in general can affect armor without it being a type of damage/element/weapon/etc.\n\nArmor can have two stats: threshold and durability.\n\nThis idea is that any weapon can eventually do maximum damage to show that there is something there that prevents doing enough health damage without feeling like it's just more health.\n\n* Threshold = how much damage reduction your weapon does against an enemy with maximum armor.\n* Durability = how long it takes to deplete the opponent's armor from maximum armor to complete depletion.\n* An enemy with low threshold and high durability will take more damage, but take longer to reach armor depletion. And enemy with high threshold and low durability will take less damage, but take a shorter time to reach armor depletion. Because it's armor, it's still tied to how much damage is done directly to health. It's not a layer on top of health, like in Borderlands where it's just yellow health that takes more damage from green bullets.\n\nThis is kinda hard to explain, as I'm not sure how to explain the math. Unlike armor in most games, your weapon will eventually reach a point of doing full damage because the opponent's armor is depleted, and is not based on using a specific perk or gimmick to do so, but universal, just like any weapon can damage shields or health. This may still lead to enemies taking the same number of attacks, but the amount of armor affects everybody targeting the opponent, meaning one player can remove the armor and another can do full damage per attack."
k9levf,You play a psychic detective that can live through the final moments of victims to find clues to their whereabouts or their killer. You aren't aware of this until after living through the final moments of some poor soul in the horror game's terrifying opening segment.,"The detective part is very limited; basically just your character in some disheveled room with walls covered in news clippings, a map, photographs, mementos and other clues. All you get to do in this segment of the game is to make connections on that wall with pins and string [like this.](https://hips.hearstapps.com/esquireuk.cdnds.net/15/37/original/original-detective-crazy-wall-43-jpg-f48b090a.jpg) You can psychic dive into mementos of victims to play &amp; replay the horror segments in search of clues that will help you find more connections. All the cases appear to be connected, and you're certain the killer is somewhere on your wall.\n\nThere are only two big problems:\n1. After years of reliving moments of the dead, the dead are starting to show up more often in the detective's visions. Perhaps even in real life too.\n2. It's becoming clear the killer has paranormal abilities too."

kh4431,Typing based MMORPG,Games like Nitrotype have had an incredible amount of success because children can go onto these websites during their computer classes and have fun while being productive but what if someone were to make a multiplayer typing game with RPG elements. It should be pretty successful and much more engaging than something like nitrotype.
kh37s7,"Cartoon Network: Punch-Time Nexus (ok, hear me out)","When a game like ""Cartoon Network: Punch-Time Explosion"" is widely disregarded as a failed experiment, it sets a precedent that something like this is a bonkers idea that was either made out of corporate greed or being out of touch with the kiddos. The original Punch-Time Explosion is without question a half-assed Smash Bros. clone that had potential but fell miserably short. However, Cartoon Network's roster for serious and action-oriented programming is quite extensive and has only grown since that game's release. So you can't tell me a brand new Cartoon Network fighting game is impossible to pull off. It totally IS possible, and here are my dreams for such a video game!\n\nThe name also comes from the OK KO special ""Crossover Nexus"", which is a love letter episode to Warner animation fans and one of the main inspirations for this dream game, so the name would only make sense. From here on out, I will be abbreviating the name to ""PTN"" for convenience.\n\nInstead of being a platform fighter, PTN is a traditional 2D fighter developed by NetherRealm and is on par in quality with Injustice 2 and MK11. A lot of their same fighting game formula would apply here, albeit keeping it T / E10 Rated. 1v1 button and directional based attacks, combos, and specials that allow matches to carry as you can imagine when playing something like Injustice 2 or MK11 *(if you couldn't tell, this game will be similar to those)* just themed and wound to assorted CN properties. For the super meter, it will be renamed the ""Punch-Time Meter"" and the super move the fighter's ""Punch-Time Explosion"". Besides that, it will function pretty much to how it does in Injustice 2.\n\nWhich properties to select is where it gets interesting... In my opinion, there should be a grand focus on CN's action-oriented programming as stated before *(Ben 10, Adventure Time, Steven Universe, Powerpuff Girls, Samurai Jack, Kids Next Door, etc.)* but also not forgetting their all-time classics. Also, the Adult Swim stuff is hard to see appearing if we want the game to have a lower rating. Either way, this opens a fantastic opportunity for some wild and zany movesets that would be crazy in any other fighting game. Imagine Dexter using mobilized metallic gadgets and lasers to send out blows! How about Courage scaring his enemies with various shrieks, cursed items, and familiar faces from the show. Maybe even Eddy can con some characters or smack them silly with jawbreakers?\n\nI also love that the NetherRealm fighters incorporate character dialogue before matches. Again, great creative goldmines here to see animated characters of different eras colliding and sparring verbal blows before matches. Also, the little Steven Universe fan in my heart would love to see Pearl's reactions to various other warriors or oddballs she's fighting!\n\nCharacter customization and leveling stats are another must! Costumes from particular episodes or significant ones from a series would be pretty sweet, and leveling up characters can encourage replay value to receive rewards for using your main or favorite character from a show.\n\nFor a story mode, why not follow the one from Crossover Nexus? A masked menace who goes by Strike starts terrorizing the livelihood of fellow Cartoon Network characters and CN City, their town of residence away from their worlds. When some unlikely heroes are all that are left who aren't striked, it's up to them to save their friends and return peace and normality to corrupted cartoony worlds Strike has invaded as well. This could lead to travels in Townsville, The Park, Beach City, etc. with encounters from familiar faces and thickened drama all around, eventually leading to an all-out boss fight with Strike himself, or some other twist revealed mastermind!\n\nAnd the usual third-party offerings could be sweet as well, and in my opinion should follow the theme of children to young adult animation. Masters of the Universe, Thundercats, maybe some Dreamworks?\n\nIt's completely unlikely something like this will ever happen, considering how distant both companies are with working with each other. If someone DID make something similar or as I'm describing and was inspired by this post, I request my post and account be credited within the project and also some kind way to play it as well once finished or however the creator sees fit. I would also like to offer some of my more specific details I couldn't fit here. Thank you so much for reading! Have a great day!"
kh1f0u,Trying to find a idea for a small game is nearly impossible for me at the moment and I don’t know why,"Hello, sorry in advance if my English is not perfect, that’s not my native language.\n\nSo, I tried to make some games since almost 2 years but I never finished them, I was to ambitious, and I can’t find a small idea to make a game.\nBut I have made some features that I can use, and I would like to know if you have some ideas to make a very simple game with it.

I then started to make some facial mocap and made it talk, and had the idea that the main character is a crazy hobo in subway tunnels at night (so no trains) he is talking to himself randomly, so you have to try to make him shut his mouth, maybe just by pressing a key and your hand would go in front of his mouth but you couldn’t aim then, to defend against the security guards that also have some dogs. And that would be just a simple doom like but with this feature. But then I tried to implement this idea with the talking thing but I could find a real purpose to stop talk since you can always run and kill enemies.

kgxff9,A game where you play as the grim reaper,"Grim, you play as the grim reaper and will in the beginning be assigned to collecting souls and guiding them to the afterlife safely. \n\nCharacters that make it safely to the afterlife can be used to influence the ending, and choices you make will also influence their views of you. A hub world will also allow you to spend time with the people you brought over, and do other things like decorate your office space where you get jobs from.\n\nIf character isn't escorted safely to the afterlife, the character is lost and becomes trapped in purgatory - a.k.a ghosts.\n\nThis would mean things like, fulfilling their last wishes, letting them make peace, solving their deaths, etc. to make escorting them to the afterlife easier. It is symbolic of letting go, they will struggle if not ready thus making the journey back harder for the player. \n\nThe game will feature unique stories that are unique for all characters. I plan on making most of them tug on your heartstrings, and laugh from others. The moment they die/are dying you will be alloted choices, and maybe you can even give them more time to be alive at your expense. \n\nThis game will be done in a pixel art style too, with a cute asthetic despite it getting menacing when the need arises. Purgatory and other areas aren't the happiest places after all."
kgujvv,Among us with no meetings,"One of this big downfalls of among us is the meetings. Communication is really slow without voice chat and you don’t really have enough time to review all the evidence. Many games in that genre, like mafia, are exclusively meetings to give them more time.\n\nWhat if you had one with no meetings? My vision is in a randomly generated labyrinth, fairly small. Players can communicate via a small allotment of messages at the top of the screen (no menu required). It would be stuff like over here, or yellow did it. \n\nIf two players agree on who did it, they can join together for boosted movement speed and the ability to do one kill, but it would only last about ten seconds, so you have to get to the killer first."
kgt8ry,Game suggestion,I would love a massive open world game set in an apocalyptic world like the last of us.\n\nHow massive open world u say? Maybe a whole country a whole world. \n\nI think this game can have colonlys like groups and stuff. Big dense forests. Left behind city's. \n\nThere can be enemy's such as bandits (other players) \n\nThe storyline can be the developers idea.\n\nThanks

From here on out, I will be abbreviating it to ""PTN"" for convenience.\n\nInstead of being a platform fighter, PTN is a traditional 2D fighter developed by NetherRealm and is on par in quality with Injustice 2 and MK11. A lot of their same fighting game formula would apply here, albeit keeping it T / E10 Rated. 1v1 button and directional based attacks, combos, and specials that allow matches to carry as you can imagine when playing something like Injustice 2 or MK11 *(if you couldn't tell, this game will be similar to those)* just themed and wound to assorted CN properties. For the super meter, it will be renamed the ""Punch-Time Meter"" and the super move the fighter's ""Punch-Time Explosion"". Besides that, it will function pretty much to how it does in Injustice 2.\n\nWhich properties to select is where it gets interesting... In my opinion, there should be a grand focus on CN's action-oriented programming as stated before *(Ben 10, Adventure Time, Steven Universe, Powerpuff Girls, Samurai Jack, Kids Next Door, etc.)* but also not forgetting their all-time classics. Also, the Adult Swim stuff is hard to see appearing if we want the game to have a lower rating. Either way, this opens a fantastic opportunity for some wild and zany movesets that would be crazy in any other fighting game. Imagine Dexter using mobilized metallic gadgets and lasers to send out blows! How about Courage scaring his enemies with various shrieks, cursed items, and familiar faces from the show. Maybe even Eddy can con some characters or smack them silly with jawbreakers?\n\nI also love that the NetherRealm fighters incorporate character dialogue before matches. Again, great creative goldmines here to see animated characters of different eras colliding and sparring verbal blows before matches. Also, the little Steven Universe fan in my heart would love to see Pearl's reactions to various other warriors or oddballs she's fighting!\n\nCharacter customization and leveling stats are another must! Costumes from particular episodes or significant ones from a series would be pretty sweet, and leveling up characters can encourage replay value to receive rewards for using your main or favorite character from a show."
kgovzt,Human vs Zombies (university game) as a simulation,"1. Game is played in real world.\n2. Anyone can join by just making 2 bandanas for himself.\n3. Humans in all public places wear green bandana, zombies - yellow.\n4. Zombies try to infect (touch) humans whereever the meet.\n5.

kgok1n,I honestly think this is a great idea that fits you peoples guidelines.,"WARNING: I spilt this up so you could get an idea of each requirement for a game, I want to thank u/Sir_Magic for his post ([https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/3kf4ty/why\_your\_game\_idea\_sucks\_and\_how\_to\_make\_it\_better/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/3kf4ty/why_your_game_idea_sucks_and_how_to_make_it_better/)) it allowed me to follow some guidelines and come up with a layout. PS: sorry for the bad use of grammar, I never really learned how to use commas and periods. Sorry this was so long I just thought this was a good idea.\n\n|**CONCEPT**: (to be honest I was just getting sleepy and thought of cubes) so the game I was thinking of would be an FPS where each match is a 1v1 in which each player starts with a single bullet and a gun. When the gun is fired the bullet exits, and if it hits someone small cubes become detached from the victim and those become ammo for the victim’s gun (it would leave an entrance and exit hole through the person) but you gain health each time you hit someone. (this is a very simple concept, I just thought it would be cool to have others' ideas added to it) Also, an optional thing would be to add the ability to take some of your own health away to make bullets.|\n|:-|\n|**GAME SIZE**: the game shouldn’t be a game that requires next gen graphics, if you want the game to have better graphics then that's up to you. (by that I mean the game size is up to you I just want a game with the core mechanics I mentioned).|\n|**GAME STYLE**: think of Super Hot kind of cubes, how when you hit someone the part explodes and becomes cubes (of course there would be less cubes) it doesn’t have to be in the style of super hot, I just thought it fits what I was thinking. Though you can make it whatever style you want.|\n\nPS: not sure what the flair ""request"" is I assume is a request for someone to make the game, and I would be happy to see it be made."
kgohqg,Open world narcos game set in Colombia 1980s,"Someone seriously needs to make this. Think GTA set in Medellin, Colombia in the 80s. You could play as a Colombian undercover cop infiltrating the cartel, or as a street thug who gets betrayed by his gang, so he becomes a police cooperator and you fight on both sides of the conflict. Anyways, there's so many ways to go about it.\n\nThe point is, it would have all the crazy historical events (FARC civil war, Pablo Escobar's drug war, all the bombings, etc), plus it's easy to implement many different factions (Medellin cartel, Cali cartel, police, government, FARC, etc). If you read into Colombian history, there is so much interesting content to make this game's narrative intense and immersive.\n\nFor gameplay, it would be similar to other open world games, but with a South American setting, you could have favelas (or ""comunas"" as they're called in Colombia), which makes combat gameplay really cool because you would have tight alleyways going uphill (Medellin is in a valley) with balconies, small houses, plenty of different angles to engage enemies and dynamic uphill battles.\n\nLastly, the setting would be really cool because you would have old school cars, latin music, insane amount of historical characters and the possibility to make an authentic game of the period, while being fun and entertaining.\n\nOf course, if I was a game developer, I would jump on this idea, but because I'm just a hobbyist, that would take years and a team of hundreds. \n\nBut hopefully someone might see this :)"
kgnvye,A game where you can become a shadow to blend in,"Basically, you have 2 forms, regular and shadow. \n\nWhile in regular form you can pick up objects, interact with others, and use objects. however you are easily seen and can be captured by enemies.\n\nAnd Shadow form makes you nearly undetectable, so you can move past most threats, you can even get into certain places you usually wouldn't be able to. But light can kill you, and you can only move in 2d."
kgn1jp,Star Wars + Battle Royale,"Not sure if this has been discussed here before. I think I might have figured out a way for Star Wars to have a Battle Royale game-mode. \n\nStarWars BattleFront II could be renamed to Star Wars: The Game and every new update from now on, including the apparent Jedi Fallen Order 2 would also go through this game as a separate game-mode. \n\nBattle Royale Setup:\n\n100 Players - Stage 1 (50 Players vs 50 Players) - The Beginning \n\n20 Players Remaining Alive - Stage 2 (10 Players vs 10 Players) - Party\n\n8 Players Remaining Alive - Stage 3 (4 Players vs 4 Players) - Squad\n\n4 Players Remaining Alive - Stage 4 (2 Players vs 2 Players) - Duos\n\n2 Players Last Alive - Stage 5 (1 Player vs 1 Player) - Final\n\nIf one side has less players then the other side, the game would automatically after each round update the side the player is playing in the next stage to always be even on both sides. \n\nDifferent random eras of StarWars with random locations of that particular era. The map would get smaller after each stage mentioned above. \n\n- Galactic Republic vs Confederacy of Independent Systems\n- Galactic Empire vs Rebel Alliance\n- First Order vs Resistance \n- Jedi vs Sith option\n\nThis could be as big as titles like Fortnite, Minecraft, Roblox or it could be a complete flop."
kgmldf,Ideas for a game with procedural planets,"I made a procedural planet system and it works great! It can create desert worlds, jungle worlds, ocean, lava, mountains, craters, even some cute little villages. I'm really proud of it, but i'm facing a big problem right now: I cant think of any game to go alongside it. My system is really flexible and can do pretty much anything as long as it fits with its scale (1km radius planets. think of the planets in spore, its pretty similar), so go nuts !"
kgkhfp,"Screw it, a community-driven Mandalorian game","It's Star Wars season and every time I finish a Mandalorian episode I can't help but think of how cool it would be as a game.\n\nThe show in itself is already like a game. Collect bounties for payments like beskar steel for armor, side missions, etc.\n\nI say community-driven because I feel as though big companies wouldn't do it justice unless it was Rockstar. It would be cool if experienced game-devs were able to make their own side quests for the game for other players.\n\nCustomization options would be a neat thing, maybe not ship stuff because making an expansive playable universe like no mans sky sounds so hectic in terms of development. Just being able to go on different planets would be sweet.\n\nI tried out Outer worlds, the vibe of that game just didn't do it for me."

kghswu,Grand strategy &amp; AOE Mixed RTS game,"I was thinking of a grand strategy game (like EU4) but without having to expand by tiles. Each player gets to pick a country on a world map and there is a colored territory overlay on every country. the player can move units around in their own territory and build an army. unlike other grand strategy games, it won't be tile based expansion, rather, the player gets to declare war on a neighboring country and move the troops that they built/recruited around enemy lands and the territory would expand to where their troops moved. they can annex the territory to a certain extent but have to pay upkeep and face cultural difference resistance and all that. So think of it as EU4 and AOE combined. The player can also build forts/cities/factories within their land but the enemy can take these strategic constructions as well."
kggowh,Infinite Instants: A game based on Zeno's Paradoxes.,"* Each main area is based on one of Zeno's Paradoxes.\n* The main mechanic is abusing the flaws in Zeno's Paradoxes to get to the end.\n* Several Main Paradoxes are used: The Arrow Paradox (if you cannot move in an instant, and time is made of infinite instants, we should not be able to move), The Grain of Millet Paradox (one grain of millet does not make a sound, but a thousand do, a thousand nothings making a something), The Paradox of Place (if everything has a place, place has a place, place's place has a place, and so on forever), The Stadium Paradox (half of an amount of time = double that amount of time), Achilles and the Tortoise (as long as something has a headstart, it should be impossible to pass them), and the Dichotomy Paradox (moving 1 unit requires moving 1/2 one unit, which requires moving 1/4 one unit, which requires moving 1/8 one unit, and so on, so we should not be able to move).\n* Basically, the Creator/Narrator is studying Zeno's Paradoxes, and decided to make a game to get his mind off it. It starts out normal, but he starts to subconsciously incorporate them into his game. As he incorporates them more, you are forced to abuse the flaws within them to complete the levels. He starts focusing on the Paradoxes more and more, and goes through an existential crisis at the end. With the final area, you abusing the flaws of the Paradoxes proves to him that they are inherently wrong, allowing him to come back to reality and finish his game.\n\nHow do you think I could incorporate the paradoxes into levels?"
kgge7l,Improved Clothing Ideas,"Though a lot has improved in games, the concept of clothing is still pretty similar, with most games either giving the player set clothing which has little impact on gameplay or have clothing with different levels of protection and weight, common in RPG and Medieval Games, though nowadays some games will have different NPC reactions depending on what you are wearing I think there are some rooms for improvement such as:\n\nClothing in games could attract or detract suspicion or questions if the game has stealth elements, like hitman wearing the right clothes to blend in is essential, but it could go further than that with clashes in clothing raising suspicions as well as clothing such as long coats and bandannas. \n\nClothing could also conceal weapons, with stuff such as trench coats, trousers with lots of pockets and so on allowing for more weapons to be carried as well as bigger weapons.\n\nClothing could also act as a deterrent to certain NPC's, lets say a petty thief in a game tried to rob you, they may run away or not attempt the robbery if your clothing looked imposing or heavily armoured.\n\nClothing could also be modified to have concealed armour underneath, secret weapons like in Assassin's Creed or just aesthetic. \n\nClothing could also be used for impersonation, again like in Hitman, but you could take this a step further by implanting it in regular games and by looking and acting like someone could access secret locations, get discounts in shops or so on.\n\nThese are just some ideas of what clothing could do, comment below about your opinion on them or if you want to add more ideas."

kg9ftr,A detective turn-based rpg.,"The game is basically your standard detective game, where you gather evidence and question witnesses in order to solve a case. The twist is that sometimes you will get turn-based battles.\n\nIn detective games, some of the evidence you gather is either a waste of space or a misdirection, since it’d be too much of a coincidence (and, not to mention, too easy of a game) if every piece of evidence you came across was used to make progress and solve the case. So, I thought it’d be neat if some of that evidence could serve a separate purpose in battles.\n\nNow, the battles don’t really work like typical rpg battles. They’re more like puzzles. Say you found a flashlight earlier that has no real purpose in the case; you could use it to blind an enemy and flee; Or if you learned that the attacker is afraid of dogs, you could use that to lie and say you have an attack dog outside and he should surrender if he doesn’t want the dog called in; Or you could simply use a gun to shoot the attacker. Whether you flee, capture, or kill the attacker will impact the story, though.\nEvery time you waste one of your turns, you take a hit. The detective can only take about five hits before going down. Once he goes down, he is either killed or has evidence stolen from him, making it harder to solve the case. \nThese battles happen very rarely at first, but become a bit more common towards the end of the game, as the detective is slowly piecing it all together and more people come out to try and stop him."
kg8wnh,What is acceptable in this sub?,"I like this sub because ideas are just getting thrown around and get more fleshed out in the comments. Many of the ideas don’t strictly have to be in games, but many of them are both good and applicable. \n\nHow on topic does an idea have to be to fit in this sub? A specific machanic seems like it belongs here. I personally like worldbuilding ideas, more on that later. Ideas that are not ideas should not belong.\n\nThis sub is the perfect place to put any ideas for a unique mechanic, or a mash of two different ones. I think these belong here.\n\nIt’s debatable if worldbuilding belongs in the sub. r/worldbuilding is dedicated to that, but what you see there is 95% art. The worldbuilding I see here is more abstract ideas encompassing the entire game. Personally, I think they should be allowed, barring that they’re ideas and not art. I have seen many that didn’t like them, though.\n\nAn idea that’s just a reskin of another game is not an idea. Like “what if we had gta5 but with Zelda characters?” That makes no sense. Unless you can extra worldbuilding or mechanics to something it is not an idea.\n\nWhat I’m asking here is, do you all think worldbuilding ideas should be allowed in this sub?"
kg7x4c,L4D2+Dead Rising styled Survival Game,"**Plot**\n\nSome survivors while escaping a horde of zombies they end up locking themselves in buildings (depend on maps) with barricade. Although the buildings were very big, they still want to get themselves out.\n\n**Mechanic**\n\nIt's a wave survival games\n\nBetween every waves is 2 minutes for players to loot the buildings (So the maps should be very large) and prepare things like traps, attachments, etc. When 2 minutes has passed or at least 75% players in a party have ready, the main entrance of the building will open and a wave will start. Notes: Before the first wave, some zombies is already in the building so they must be killed to start looting.\n\nA wave lasts 5 minutes. In the first 2 minutes, players must clear the zombies from the main entrance first. Then zombies will appear from other entrances (windows, back doors, etc). After every 3 waves, the loot respawn. Every 5 waves there is a bandit raid, it's just like a normal wave but with bandits. At the end of every wave is a mini-boss battle. \n\nIn the building there is two station (work like Warzone buy station). You get money from killing, then use it to buy from the station. Contents in the station maybe items (Grenade, Medkit, Armor), perks (Double Damage, Faster Reload), contracts activated with a wave start to earn more money (Escort, Rampage) or even reviving downed teamates. Each station can be bought one thing before every wave.\n\nYou can co-op with friends or with bots and the maps will change depend on the number of players. (1-2 players: small maps like normal house      2-4 players: Medium maps like office rooftop, subway              4-8 players: Big maps like Mansion, Bank, Hotel)\n\nThere are some minigames like Team Deathmatch (4v4 fight with chosen loadout)\n\nProtect the V.I.P (Like the Escort Contract)\n\nHardcore (An infinited wave survival with unlimited ammo, no station)\n\nIn the lobby section, you can do some stuff like Buying gun skins (gotten by opening crates, crates can be obtained by buying with a currency, doing missions or 0.5% chance to get every wave in-game), inviting friends, customize loadout for Team Deathmatch)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is my first post in this subreddit :/"
kg79my,"Third person open world RPG-lite, explorer in 19th Century South America","Basic premise: an open world, third person, RPG-lite (think: RDR2), set in 19th Century South America and/or Central America and the US.\n\nThe point: a story-driven game, with an action/RPG style. The game sees you as a 19th Century explorer, working for a museum / naturalist, tasked with exploring the jungles. The narrative arc would focus on the central character exploring / cataloguing the jungle, in an Indiana Jones / Uncharted style fighting / combat centric exploration. \n\nQuest lines allow you options. For example: the tension between industrialisation and traditional / native communities in the jungle. Do you take the side of the corporations (clearing the jungles, logging, turning a profit), or the natives (protecting their way of life, resisting the corporations). This would play out as choosing a side whose story you follow (think: Skyrim, choosing a faction to align with). The choices you make then inform how the game progresses, with a moralistic element (like KOTOR or Fable, minus the light / dark). You could yourself become completely corporate, clearing out communities and jungles but turning a huge profit. This might give you access to unique weapons (such as prototype advanced weapons); whereas choosing the natives and resisting corporations could also give you access to unique things - skills (training in stealth) and weapons (poison arrow frogs, to create poison darts).\n\nOverall, the game would be third person action adventure. You’re exploring the jungle and urban surroundings, meeting new people and following “main” story missions - such as discovering a community / artefact. But, along the way, there are fights (nature, locals, bandits, militias) and side quests to find. The focus would be less open world “bloat” (looting for the sake of it via crates, clearing area X) and more on things that advance the narrative - for example, a riddle about an important sacred artefact, wherein working this out allows you to find a unique item.\n\nReward / skill unlocks are less “add stat % x” and more things such as, if you choose to learn a language, it affects dialogue options. If Spanish is spoken in the local towns, you start the game with a certain baseline - so you can just about understand, with subtitles. But language learning skills mean you could go through different iterations - communicating at a basic level, communicating more clearly, fluency (at which point, what they say is no longer delivered as subtitles).\n\nRealistically, the scope / size of the game would depend on the budget - for a really detailed jungle teeming with life (again, as per RDR2 wildlife), the map isn’t going to be huge / some of that detail and/or graphical output is sacrificed.\n\nThoughts?"

kg27z6,Time travel attack,"Just an idea for a game mechanic that can be employed in various kinds of games. You are given an ability to time travel to the past, while keeping the original timeline. So basically you will duplicate at some point in the past. Your previous self will keep doing what you did the first time around (not unlike those ghosts in car simulators, but it will actually be a legit entity). And you are now controlling your new instance. Repeat this multiple times and you got yourself an army, where each soldier is you.\n\nI'm imagining this could be interesting in a game similar to Dark Souls.\n\nSome thoughts on the implementation. \n\nOnce you travelled back, you'll spawn at the same location where you were back then. So it may make sense to ignore all collisions with yourself and maybe skip rendering of the ""ghost"" if you are currently inside of it.\n\nAt the moment where you travel back, you disappear from the current timeline. So if there is a monster that can only be killed with a simultaneous strike from two sides, you'll need to time your travel, and actions after the travel so you can catch up with your previous self and sync your attacks.\n\n\nSome thought will need to be put into whether you just literally rewind back (so all your health, exp and equipment reverts to what it was back then), or your current instance spawns in the past with whatever you acquired since then. Also whether or not you can interact with your clones (to for example heal them)."
kfwtbe,Zelda and Metal Gear,"  Aight, so I've decided to start on this new project. Really, I think the two styles would blend pretty well, gameplay-wise seeing, as for a start, that they've both had entries that were top-down action adventures. \n  I'm thinking for the control side of things, use something like the two item system that the top-down Zelda games that most items and abilities can be mapped to, plus separate buttons for crouching, codec calls, and luring, (think MGSV for that last one.) \n  First couple of tech demos, I'm thinking like, a small open sandbox mapped out kinda like Zelda 1, (which I think works well bc of how similar Zelda 1's map system is to MG2's.)\n  As far as story, I'm thinking of working out the rest of the manuscript along the way, but influenced by MGS and the SMT franchise.\n  Any thoughts anyone?"

The transmission is how long they train, the symptoms are there weapons, and abilities are how long they can resist in cold or hot temperatures.

I have left a couple prompts below: \n\n* How will the layers differ?\n* How will the player move between layers? Physically or telepathically (i.e. having different playable characters on each layer)\n* Is it a coop game (a player per layer)? If so, how will players interact?\n\nExamples:\n\n* [Final Ninja](http://www.nitrome.com/games/finalninja/), which had a mechanic where you can enter the shadows when standing still to avoid enemies/spotlights\n* [Toodee and Topdee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EodWWKbK6Ng&amp;ab_channel=dietzribi), a game where you switch between a 2D Platformer character and Top-Down character in the same map to solve puzzles"
kfqso4,Small bug catching game,"heres a rambly idea from my notes app, nothing innovative just a simple game based on games i like (animal crossing, pokemon, stardew valley, yokai watch, etc.)\n\ngame where you explore a town and can collect bugs and display them in a small house you live in. Characters are all animals. Bugs would be found in trees, bushes, under rocks, dirt piles and sometimes in buildings. The town would have lots of houses and characters that you can talk to and interact with and you can learn about the relationships of the characters and such. You would have a journal which would keep track of the kinds of bugs youve caught and how many youve caught. The journal will also keep track of characters youve met and quests that they may give you which would all be some form of fetch quest. your house is customizable with you being able to display your bugs. Mechanics for catching bugs would be simple, there would be a certain chance to catch certain bugs within each item(tree, bush, etc) and when you click on the bush and you will either see an exclamation point meaning theres a bug or you will receive a message saying ""couldnt find any bugs..."" or something and if you see the exclamtion point you will click and you will either catch the bug and it would say ""you caught a ... !"" or ""it got away! :("". In the game there will be different kinds of nets you can buy that would improve in quality making you more likely to catch a bug and also be able to catch different kinds of bugs. These could be bought in the store except the best net would be gifted somehow(will figure out later). There will be many shops in town where you can buy furniture, nets, or honey to attract bugs. When you use honey itll make bugs more likely to show up. The goal is to catalouge every bug essentially and become a bug catching master. There are a few other characters in the game that also are bug catchers and some characters that hate bugs. You can sell your bugs in stores or to certain characters for different prices depending on how much they like bugs. Some characters would be offended if you ask them to sell them your bugs and wont talk to you for bit. If you listen to these characters dialougues they will make it evident that they hate bugs. These characters will also reward you if you catch bugs inside their houses or stores. The game doesnt neccesarily have an ending but major achievements would to meet every character and catch every bug. After youve caught the last bug you would be met with a message of congratulation and also a thank you for playing. You can still continue to play afterwards. Still thinking about whether or not their should be a day/night schedule and months and seasons. character selection you will pick between being a cat, dog, or frog and then you will pick between 4 clothing styles. The character will be genderless but will be referred to as young but old enough to live on their own. Possibly replace just clicking for bugs with a short mini game."

If this game somehow exists already then forgive my blatant ignorance.\nI’m just daydreaming, hence the flair.\nOkay, here goes...\n\nI’m thinking a RPG/sandbox game set in the Futurama universe with the cartoony graphics like we got in Hit&amp;Run way back when (obviously improved). It would initially be set in New New York, with opportunities to travel to other planets (like in Outer Worlds).\n\n- I don’t have a specific main quest line in mind, but would be cool roleplaying as a new member of Planet Express, traveling the universe with Fry, Leela, Bender &amp; co. doing deliveries and getting into problems.\n- Possible antagonists: Nixon, Robot Devil, MOM, Lrrrr.\n- Side quests could introduce the protagonist to other famous characters, like Calculon, Elzar, Flexo, the construction worker who only speaks plural, to name a few...\n- Character creation would let you mix a lot of different species and robots we see in the TV show to add to the already diverse personalities of the delivery crew. \n- Body modification for sure\n- I consider Futurama to be a show mostly for adults, so features like partying, gambling, sex, alcoholism and drug use could be implemented. Some violence as well with all that future tech. I mean, there’s suicide booths... All this would also make a world with some depth, not just an empty shell.\n\nObvious problems: copyrights and voice actors.\n\nAppreciate all kinds of feedback."
kfk7nz,Eternal Shard,"""Fantasy-craft on-survival-battle royal""\n\nShards of material ""material pyramid""\nWind (in fact empty game world)-&gt;Earth (shards foundation) -&gt; Water, Sand, Gras, Stone (higher material grid) -&gt; up to different materials (Wood, Metal ...) more and more rare and at the end of the pyramid the eternal shard.\n\nThe eternal shard - the eternal shard is a undistructable win count item - the player wins the game for the time holding it in his/her inventory. Can also be done by groups or alliances with somekind of a king and can be transfered. The item is always to find on the map!\n\nGameworld made of different shards with  different sizes and abilities:\nConsistent shards are programmed shards by the developer.\nProcedural shards are ^^ procedural generated shards who disapear after a time.\nPrivate shards from the player can be individulized.\n\nCrafting:\nAll materials in the game world can be crafted into items (weapons, skins, skills ... what ever)\nSome materials (high shards) are very rare, so only a low amount of powerful items can be crafted. If the item gets destroyed by death of the player or by destroying/using it the raw material will respawn again in the game world. Some on known location, some random or hidden, some with a shrinking circle. Some will create their own shards with powerful NPC protecting the material shard.\n\nExample: A glove for fire magic needs te be crafted and maintained. The fire shards will be spawn again if the glove will be destroyed. They need to be collected and farmed on the location.\n\nThe rest is typical action and role play gaming. I would recommend fixed amount life points/ one 100% heath bar and  the items will increase/decrease life in a procedural way. (fire glove - fire ball - 1% dmg/per use/per sec what ever...)"
kfimhs,Contemporary cargo pirate,"Many pirate games have been developed but no contemporary pirate games. I think this game would work if it was developed by Kojima because the main hub could be like outer heaven from phantom pain. You could develop your own ship which would track down and board cargo ships. Then you could collect cargo or just sell the ship. It would also be cool if you could convert captured crew into pirates. In this world, cargo ships would have machine guns and private military to protect Maritime trading. You could also have different national navy’s protecting cargo ships. Starting from the bottom with some dinky ship but eventually obtaining a destroyer or something amazing."
kfi16d,PERMADEATH OR KILL YOURSELF,"First, I'd like to acknowledge that the act of self harm or suicide is very serious. If you or anyone you know is considering these acts please seek help immediately.\n\n\*\*GAME IDEA:\*\*A single player story focused stealth Horror FPS about a PC being stalked by monsters. The PC has a revolver with limited ammunition. They may use their bullets to shoot the monsters which only temporarily puts them out of action until it respawns or wakes up. Think Immortal Jack from Resident Evil 7.\n\nIf the monster kills the player it's permadeath and the player must start the game all over again.\n\nIf the player is trapped or doesn't think they'll be able to escape the monster then they may kill themselves. This may include jumping to their death from a great height or use one of their bullets to shoot themselves in the head. The player may then continue the game from the last autosaved checkpoint.\n\nThe conclusion changes depending on the number of times the player has killed themselves such as a bad ending for many suicides or a good ending for none.\n\nPOST EDIT:For those that dislike the Permadeath idea alternatively when PC is killed by the monster they start from the last autosaved checkpoint but number of times PC killed by monster impacts ending / all of their collected items needed to open a door or solve a puzzle are taken away then player must find them again."
kfhjvw,Hoarders: The Game,"I came up with a idea for a video game based on the show hoarders buried alive.  You have a house and you have to go around the neighborhood to dumpsters, trash cans, thrift stores, to find treasures and you pack them into your house and the more treasures you can get into your house the more points you get, working towards a goal. \nThe gameplay would be based on difficulty with the controls. so I'm imagining your arms being held out in front of you and you press a button to make them squeeze together to grab something and you can rotate your arms clockwise or counterclockwise like a claw machine to grab things at different angles. You could even have a power up that gives you a third arm to claw grab stuff.\nYou could have events where a fire springs up in your house and you have to put it out before it destroys everything. And you could have government officials come to shut you down and evict you and you have to go through some sort of side activity to get rid of them."
kfhfp4,A Memento-like game,"Rewatched Memento again and thought it could be interesting to use the mechanics in a game. If you haven't watched Memento - stop here, and go watch it and then come back. A must see movie! And don't read below because of SPOILERS.\n\nSo the game is broken into timed episodes (say 10 minutes each). In each episode you have to get to the next ""checkpoint"" in time. An episode can be anything - a puzzle, a multiple choice level where only one choice is correct, an action sequence, you name it.\n\nIf you don't solve an episode in time, you're returned to the beginning of the episode. If you do solve it - you enter the next episode, which actually chronologically comes before the one you just cleared (just like in the movie). \n\nSo the game starts with something like you defeating the biggest boss of the game (maybe in a very specific way with a very specific weapon, you are supposed to have acquired). And then you proceed by 10-minute episodes backward in time to figure out why you came here and why you had to defeat the boss. The beginning of each episode, is the ending of the episode chronologically before it. But for you it's gonna be the next episode, so it'll give you clues and you'll know what to look for. So, say, if the first episode starts with you walking through a red door and then killing the boss. In the next episode, you'll need to find that red door (the checkpoint). And this new episode starts with you falling from some height onto a platform. So you know, in the next episode you'll be looking for a platform that is down below. Etc. So aside from solving puzzles, mini games and doing some action, you and your own memory will be the analog of notes and photos Lenny had in the movie.\n\nSorry if messy and makes little sense, but I had to write it down... you know what I mean."
kfgz0w,Would a souls-inspired game be lame or the wrong move to make??,"I’m currently in the process of slowly making my dream souls-inspired game (Dark Souls, Bloodborne, Demon’s Souls, etc.) and I was curious, is this the right move?? Is this market over saturated with other games?? Is it worth trying to make a game like this with it being such a niche market it would get swept under the rug?? I’m curious about all of this and I’d love to have a discussion about this from die hard fans and casual lovers of the series."
kfaan4,Are gameideas more about story or gameplay?,"As someone who really focus on the gameplay it feels weird to see every ideas being more about story than anything.\n\nLike you can tell me your game is a fps in a cyberpunk futur where you have to make deals with cyberlords to make money. And I still have no idea what the game is.\n\nAnd why do people seams to be okay with that? For me a good gameidea is when you can understand some of the gameplay loops, or the main one at least. \n\n""You have to travel in your armored car throught deserts to reach new cities in order to refuel and get new parts for *amazing task you have to do*"". Just that would be enought even if it doesn't explain how you deal with the travelling part, because you have one loop, a part with no ressources, the desert, and the opposite with the cities. You can already imagine that both places have very different dangers and goals, co-dependent of each other. And you have a main goal."
kf9ahr,Idea for a baking/cooking face-off game?,"So, I had an idea for a game wherein you can face-off against other players in creating a dish. This is mostly based off of Worst Cooks in America, where people face-off against each other in getting their dish to look and taste similar to like how the host chef previously introduced and created the dish. Obviously, since the idea for this would be implemented into a video game, you can't necessarily taste the dish - but you can definitely try to make it look similar to the dish you need to replicate. \n\nI haven't fully hashed out anything yet, but what do you guys think? Any suggestions/changes you would want to make?"
kf6yy5,a terror/creepypasta creatures hero shooter,"it would be a overwatch like 5v5 FPS with the heroes being monster of creepypastas or legends, such as the chupacabra, werewolf or even cthulhu and the grim reaper.  \nI already thougt of 3 ""heroes""  \n1. the pope lick monster: he would be a DPS kind of character with his axe as a primary, he would be very mobile being able to jump high and have a running speed a bit higher than most characters,i couldn't think of any abilitys for him, one could be a super jump, a dash cutting anyone in his path or whatever, his ult would be the train he uses to kill people, when used, a portal will appear and a train would come trought it, the train would be very fast and dealt high damage, but only in a straight line  \n2. Jack the ripper: he would be a flank char with a gun for his primary and a straight razor for his mouse2 attack, that if used correctly deals insane damage, but he would have fairly low health, his toolkit would help him approach his target for the straight razor kill, one ability could make him invisible and faster for a short period of time and the other one could be just him unloading his magazine in the enemy ( i didn't have creativity enough for this)  \n3. and last but not least cthulhu, that surprisingly enough would be a surport: he would attack with a ball of magic property that would inflict one of two debuffs, fear, that would reduce 25% of your opponent damage, and weak, which makes the target take more 25% damage, cthulhu can change between debuffs with mouse2, and since he is a priest he could heal his teammates with some eldritch prayer, and for his ult he would summon a big black circle with runes, and when a enemy steps on it they will be inflicted the terrified debuff, wich makes them take 50% more damage, do 40% less damage and take damage overtime (and it would overwrite both the fear and weak bebuff)  \nfor maps it could be the places where people see these monsters, there could be ruins of a cathedral of cthulhu floating in space, vlad's castle, black hill forest. (sorry if any engrish, english isn't my first language)"
kf3q8s,Hackusations Class Based Shooter,"You ever played an online game ~~called warzone~~ where someone was hacking? You ever done so good in a public lobby that you got called a hacker?\n\nLet's just make a game out of it\n\nHackusations would be a class based shooter game, where the classes have built in hacks. Such as X-Ray that allows you to see players through walls. Or an Aimbot (But with a weaker weapon to prevent it from absolutely laser beaming another player).\n\nThe core gameplay would be similar to FPS games such as CoD or CSGO. But the class system would be similar to games like Overwatch or Paladins (Where you have to play to unlock other characters).\n\nEach character would have a unique hack (X-Ray, Aimbot, Speed Hacks, Etc) and a weapon catered to their hack. (Speed Hack would have a weapon like an SMG. Aimbot would have a weapon like a Semi Automatic Rifle with a slower rate of fire so that way it wouldn't be too OP).\n\nHonestly, I have no clue how this would function in practice, I just had the idea when I was playing TitanFall with a friend and he said ""Fuck it, just give everyone aimbot and see what happens"". I'm open for ideas!"
kf387i,Feed em up Tower Defense,"I have a small child and don't want to expose him to guns and gore, but do want him to enjoy video games. So here is my idea of re framing the traditional tower defense game mechanic into something that it a little more G rated:\n\nThe Nexus you are supposed to defend is some really artistically decorated food item like a wedding cake. The mobs that are attacking you are hungry people or animals. Your towers shoot food of various types at the mobs so that they are no longer hungry and leave your Nexus cake alone.\n\nDifferent types of tower give off different types of food and different types of enemies will be ""vulnerable or immune"" to those types of food. For example vegetarians will be immune to the roast beef turret and the gravy dispenser.\n\nThis context also solves one of the big narrative flaws I see in turret defense. If the things you are killing are such a threat, why don't they attack your turrets?"
kf2drr,Post post apocalyptic game,"A game where society has already rebuilt in the aftermath of an apocalypse, but they didn’t ever fix the thing that caused it in the first place.\n\nYou could find out what caused it last time at the beginning, and slowly uncover that it’s still there.\n\nI have no idea how you would implement this game. I thought y’all might have some ideas."
keziui,Asymmetrical multiplayer game where one player controls a haunted house and the other one has to survive the night.,"So you know those movies where the house is possessed by something and has soul of its own.\n\nOne player would control the haunted house in birds eye view. They can control the basic features of the house like doors and windows or electricity, water, gas and devices. \n\nThen the other player (or more players) would be a journalist who has heard of this house and challenges himself to survive one night in the house. They play in first person perspective.\n\nThe goal of the house is to kill the player by provoking accidents through their remote control of the house, for example by creating short circuits and causing a fire and then lock the door.\n\nThe player has to just survive one night."
kew69r,Rogue-like but you play as a support character," \n\nHi everyone.\n\nI  have the an idea for a small rogue-like game (right now I was thinking  of developing it for myself/itch.io, not really commercial development)  and I am looking for some opinions before I decide to proceed with my  game development.\n\nThe game is more  or less a typical, 2D rogue-like; you enter a dungeon/area, kill  monsters until you die, use the gold/exp to upgrade gear and skills,  rinse and repeat. Here's the twist - the character is designed to be  more of an alchemist/support mage with few offensive capabilities. You  would get into the dungeon with some AI controlled mercenaries (or solo  if you want) and your job would be to support them with spells and/or  potions and debuff the mobs. There would be some offensive capabilities  of course such as weaker spells, skyrim-esque runes that would trigger  when a mob steps on them and throwing potions/poisons at the mobs.\n\nI'm  just not fully convinced that this game loop is exciting enough. Or  maybe I'm thinking inside the box too much and can't think of items and  abilities that would make playing support fun.\n\nEither  way, I would love to hear what you think about this. Do you have any  comments or ideas that would make this mechanic better? Or maybe there  are already games out there that force you into that playstyle that I  have completely missed them. It'd be nice to see this idea in practice."
kerxtu,Game idea!,I have a cool idea for a game where you live in a city that is only night. The reason for this is because there is a dome that was placed over your city to stop any light from getting in our out. The crime rate was so high in the city so the dome was placed there. The main point of the game will be to escape the dome and find the people who did this. This game will be a third person shooter/adventure game.\n\nStill thinking of a title.\n\nPlease do not steal my idea :)
keq02a,A single player fighting/puzzle game,"In traditional 1-on-1 fighting games, many players enjoy spending time in the training mode trying to figure out new or optimized combos, a process typically known as ""labbing"". Players will often spend more time labbing than they spend actually playing against opponents.\n\nMy idea is for a fighting game that consists entirely of this training mode style labbing. This would actually make it more like a puzzle game than a traditional fighting game. You would get a randomly generated character with different moves and properties each time you play. Your goal would be to try to string your moves together in a way to deal the most damage to a dummy opponent.\n\nThere could be things like daily challenges with a leaderboard, where everyone gets the same character and competes for the high score. The controls could be simplified in comparison to other fighting games, and I think it could work well on mobile."
keocwe,"Game where you have 1 minute to get to the next map by solving a puzzle, but killing enemies adds time","Pretty much the title. What do you think about a game where you start with like 1 minute, and each kill adds 5 or 10 seconds to the clock. Meanwhile, you have to try to figure out some sort of puzzle to advance to a mini boss, which defeating will put you into a new world where you do it all again. I’m thinking permadeath and the map is different each time and you have to beat a certain number of maps and a final boss to win."
kemxtt,Pvp (1v1) strategy/action: Detectives vs Monsters,"Abstract flair coz it's a vague, dream/recurring train of thought/imaginary game idea. In my head, it's either very basic 2D graphics or full-on VR, possibly cell shaded anime-style... well, anyway...\n\n__Basic Concept?__\n\nSome unknown monster is feeding on people, and the local police investigate to put a stop to it.\n\n\n__How is it a game?__\n\nSetting is a populated environment, probably a small town, with a relatively short day-night schedule. Randomly generated NPCs inhabit homes, run shops, work jobs, etc. and follow a vague schedule (maybe a simple morning/afternoon/evening/night rather than hourly), also other random NPCs visit during the day.\n\nOne side plays the monster(s). There'd be a variety to select from, ideally by combining some base elements, stats, perks, etc. For example, play as a small/average/large humanoid/beast/insect with an emphasis on strength/agility/intelligence, that borrows/jumps/flies, and reproduces by laying eggs/infecting humans/dividing in two, and burrows/pretends to be human/fires projectiles that stun. You setup a lair in the forest/sewers/old lady's apartment and begin your reign of terror.\n\nMeanwhile, the other side plays a detective from the local police force, with no initial idea of what kind of monster the other playing is playing as. Starting with a set size of police in their building and a number assigned to their team, they begin patrolling, looking for signs of trouble, talking to NPCs. Over time, the town begins to panic. People keep going missing... there's weird mucus near the sewer entrance... there's video evidence of someone getting their head bitten off... whatever, the mayor is giving the police more resources, whatever they need, just find the monster(s) and exterminate them before it's too late.\n\n__Mechanics?__\n\nFor the monster player, they need to be feeding to reproduce (either cheap drones you send to do basic tasks or expensive clones/lieutenants you can send to do better tasks or even swap control to) or level up (gain stats/perks), depending on the monster's playstyle (one powerful monster that doesn't reproduce but levels up quickly, a monster that stays weak individually but quickly swarms, or somewhere in between). No matter the monster type, eating humans is always required to some degree - maybe there's a base ""hunger"" of x humans per day or lose n health, + y per drone/clone or lose them, or beyond that you gain health and/or per z eaten gain a level/perk/stat boost.\n\nAlso, NPCs have a general ""panic"" stat for the population and an individual ""suspicion"" stat - one NPC is always eaten at the start to kick things off, then at least one resident NPC that shares part of their schedule (lives nearby/visits their store/works together) will gain suspicion, and will start ""investigating"" after a day or two (checking forest for their missing hiker friend/poking around alleyways/knocking on apartment door looking for missing old lady). Their suspicion continues to increase, at a rate based on current panic level, and they will go to the police (starting with concern, escalating to  instance on urgent action), and will also slightly raise panic level, increasingly so over time. Eating them will add slightly to panic, but at least remove their over-time effect, but a new NPC would beginning raising their suspicion level anew, so monsters can only buy time at best; even eating the minimum required in perfect stealth, there will always be at least one NPC that will gradually increasing panic, even if very slowly compared to eating lots of people and leaving witnesses.\n\nMonster stats would be Strength (how quickly can you overpower and kill a human), Agility (how fast do you move) and Intelligence (how sneaky are you, can you outsmart the humans), and might influence what perks you have available or their effect (e.g. min. 5 INT required to unlock, -0.2 sec from time to feed per STR point).\n\nIf the monsters remove the police, they win. If police remove the monsters l, llthey win . \n\nMeanwhile, the police would be aiming to increase their power to deal with the monster(s). Population number would be tracked but only updated when an NPC is confirmed missing/dead. Talking to NPCs out on patrol could confirm if other NPCs are missing (""shop's been closed for 3 days now, no sign, weird, huh?""). Monsters would leave physical evidence behind that can be picked by police, more so left when killing/feeding, and such evidence could be gathered at the police station (assuming the officer carrying it doesn’t mysteriously vanish en route) for a bigger ""bonus"". Based on missing/dead population, population panic level, evidence found, etc. there's an increase of department resources to utilise (more/better officers to send out, perks/abilities unlocked, upgrade HQ for bonuses like NPCs raise suspicion level faster or report directly police HQ sooner, security cameras placed to capture footage, etc.)\n\nBased on how resources are allocated, this would allow some choice in playstyle for police also - one super detective with great STR &amp; AGI stats and a lot of perks to take down found monsters, or a big team of cops collecting physical evidence to hand to scientists back at HQ to research a chemical-based trap to capture a live monster and get the army sent in.\n\nHopefully, this would lead to a dynamic where the monster decides between a hard &amp; fast play, swarming the police HQ early with better strength stat, or useful perks, or a small army, and taking it out before reinforcements can arrive... or spend points on intelligence to leave less evidence behind, learn which NPCs are more noticeable in their absence and gain less panic when eating, learn from NPCs what upgrades the police are purchasing with their resources so you can counteract/avoid, etc., while the police have to commit resources to gaining additional sources of info to get even _more_ resources later in the game, or get well armed boots on the ground to hunt down &amp; deal with the menace."

The barrier can't be crossed and is heavily protected by the government as it covers some dark secrets.

keglga,A Zelda game with Devil May Cry gameplay,"after thinking about it a bit, a legend of zelda game with Devil May Cry gameplay is an amazing idea.\n\nA lot of mechanics could easily be translated over, of course you would have your melee attacks with the master sword and ranged attacks with the bow &amp; arrow. The hookshot could be used in place of the Devil breaker. Link could also use multiple weapons and swap them with the triggers just like in Devil May Cry (switching between different arrows, switching between other Melee weapons like the Biggoron sword or Megaton Hammer)"

kecgm6,I-Ninja for the Nintendo Switch.,"If you’ve ever played I-Ninja on the GameCube, PS2 or the Original Xbox growing up, then you’d know how fun and difficult it was. \n\nThere were fast paced ‘Inertia Run’levels, combat arena’s, ‘Ball Rolling’ levels requiring pin point accuracy and cool showdowns in the ‘Final Boss’ levels. All of these things gave the game such an iconic feel that still holds nostalgia with me. \n\nIf ever Shuntaro Furukawa reads this “open letter” please consider remaking this game but on the Nintendo Switch &lt;3\n\nThat is all."
kebajz,A Persistent Idea,"One thing that I notice when playing a lot of the game is that your actions don't typically last long. If you involved in a gigantic shoot-out, chances are next time you stroll past the place you'll find that all damage has been repaired and the place looks good as new. \n\nTherefore, I would suggest the concept of a persistent mechanic, this basically means that throughout the game, whether you accidentally hit a tree when firing a gun or drop an object on the floor, it stays there throughout the game. Also, if there is a body, it won't despawn unless its in somewhere like a city where it would be presumed it would be removed after a while. This concept though definitely requires a higher end pc to be able to run smoothly if implanted in games, could help feel like your actions impact the game, and it isn't a matter of going to one mission, do the objectives, the game cleans up your mess and everyone acts like nothing ever happened, it adds some realism to the game.\n\nIf this seriously impacts less powerful PCs the solution is to simply make it available only if you select it in the options, or make it so only certain things don't despawn such as bullet holes and smashed objects rather than just the contents of your inventory you've thrown out or such."

ke83xq,A Post-Apocolyptic Survival Sandbox Game,"So, I'm a huge sucker for sandbox and simulation games and recently stumbled upon Rimworld, [shapez.io](https://shapez.io) (and got back into minecraft) and I wanted to create a game which basically combines the ""story"" aspect of Rimworld, crafting and survival of minecraft and automation from [shapez.io](https://shapez.io).\n\nIn my head, I can see sort of a base creation game where you try and defend yourself from creatures (say zombies) while providing for recruits or normal civilians who live within. \n\nStarting from absolutely nothing, you command just a couple of recruits before moving to become the commander of different divisions like Agricultural, Research or Military and tell a generalized group on doing certain tasks.\n\nThis process sounds tedious, which is where automation comes in. Once the player has reached a certain point in the game, automation can help relieve the player of many tasks such as telling a division to move items from one area to another or telling a military division to move around and defend one area before moving to another, that sort of thing. (It might be able to remove the military division completely if the turrets used to combat the creatures are automated but havent really planned anything in detail yet)\n\nWhile you're reading, you must be wondering where these people come from. Simple answer would be similar to rimworld where you go around different ""chunks"" of the map and look for lone or group survivors who are willing to go back with you to your base and become part of a division based on their character traits.\n\nI was planning on an infinite world, but also a finite world could be interesting...\n\nThe main reason I posted here is because 1. I wasn't sure if people were going to be interested, so if you would be please tell me :D (also if you think there could be something changed from this idea in mind, also comment that) and 2. It sounds really similar to other games and not sure if it would cause some upset since it's basically mixing together games to create a new game.\n\nThanks for reading hopefully you got some suggestions or ideas :)"
ke7cmv,Anyone wants to work on a game with me?,"Here's my idea for a game that wanted to do myself, but I currently have 2 projects running already.\n\nThe setup: The year is 3xxx, and the earth is pretty much a wasteland after an invasion of insect like aliens. There are very little human survivor bastions left. You, the protagonist belong to an intelligent unit, task to seek out resources for survival and defending your bastion. Your squad is a gatherer squad, equipped with a highly advanced Powersuit like robot. Your suit, the gatherer suit is less performant in combat, then a fighter suit, but the ai and sensoric/analytic functions are topknoch. One day, while out on a mission to retreat the power cores (most valuable item ingame) of a fightersquad that got eliminated by some epic battle, your team gets attacked, and all, but you and your suit get eliminated.\n\nGameplay:\n\nGoal: Far away from your bastion, and not enough energy to go back, you try to go back to the safety of your bastion.\n\nThe twist: Your suit is your safe space. Nearly nothing can harm you while in it. But you need to find food and water to survive. Inside your suit, you have access to all your options, but everything costs energy. Want to communicate with your ai? Costs energy Want to analyse the unknown  plant you gathered? Costs energy. Long range scans? lots of energy. Fly? Tons of energy. So the gameplay is an energy management system, while try to survive and get back home.\n\nFeel: The idea is, that the player should feel an emotional attachment to his/her suit, feeling save and highly capable while in the suit and very helpless without. Problem is, the more options you use, the more energy is used and the more the player will have to forfeit his options and get closer to danger, and eventually have to rely on themself, when the suit is out of energy (peak tension moments of the game). You can modify the suit with modules you gather/build."

One day, while out on a mission to retreat the power cores (most valuable item ingame) of a fightersquad that got eliminated by some epic battle, your team gets attacked, and all, but you and your suit get eliminated.\n\nGameplay:\n\nGoal: Far away from your bastion, and not enough energy to go back, you try to go back to the safety of your bastion.\n\nThe twist: Your suit is your safe space. Nearly nothing can harm you while in it. But you need to find food and water to survive. Inside your suit, you have access to all your options, but everything costs energy. Want to communicate with your ai? Costs energy Want to analyse the unknown  plant you gathered? Costs energy. Long range scans? lots of energy. Fly? Tons of energy. So the gameplay is an energy management system, while try to survive and get back home.\n\nFeel: The idea is, that the player should feel an emotional attachment to his/her suit, feeling save and highly capable while in the suit and very helpless without. Problem is, the more options you use, the more energy is used and the more the player will have to forfeit his options and get closer to danger, and eventually have to rely on themself, when the suit is out of energy (peak tension moments of the game). You can modify the suit with modules you gather/build."
ke6lkf,simple/raw FPS game for esports,"I'm talking about a game similar to csgo/valorant, that is to say, rather simple and for which it is easy to get high framerates. I would like a game where there is not much to learn, a game mainly based on aiming, where rushing is favored. Ideally, it would be even simpler than csgo/valorant, and less based on camping and holding angles. Rather, it would be based on rushing, creativity during action, aiming. A game thought toward competition. Simple, sober, efficient.I don't really like csgo's bulletspread and general aiming mechanics.\n\n*Let's imagine this game:*\n\n**Overall format:** Like CSGO. Except no weapons to buy. 5on5. One side has to plant 1 bomb among 2 possible bombs (this way, sides are balanced).\n\n**Weapons:** You choose between sniper rifle and machin gun (primary weapon), and you spawn with 1 grenade et 1 pistol as well. Nothing complicated here, you are either a sniper or an MG.\n\n**Weapon/Aiming mechanics:** Damage should be large outside the head (unlike in csgo) and shooting 3-4 bullets anywhere in the middle of the body should be enough to kill. Aiming for the head above all is not really something I'm a fan of. The grenades would have their trajectory altered with random noise, so that training for prepared nades is not a thing anymore.\n\n**Maps:** For this game to not be about skills specific to the game itself and its particular maps (like you need to know the timings, the usual moves and spots, in order to compete in csgo for instance), the maps would be randomly generated at each game, using artificial intelligence. Which means that the map itself is unknown, new, and unique for each game. And this way, there is no way to geek the map up (prepare tactics and nades). There would be a minimap where you see the map layout (like in csgo) with the location of the 2 bombs, and the location of your teammates.\n\n**Technical aspects:** Thanks to a sober game without complicated graphics, it would be easy to run 500+ FPS. This way, it would be compatible with the new generation of high refresh rate monitors, and motion clarity could try and approach real human experience (I own a 360 Hz monitor and it is a substantial improvement for competitive FPS, thanks to better stroboscopics - there is still a very significant room for improvement in this regard, and it is admitted by experts that 1000 Hz monitors are the future). Other technical aspect: cheat protection. The game design should be made with the constraint to not allow for cheats (I mean, the way the game works should be defined according to the constraint of having a highly-secure anticheat - say, very naively, that the client is not receiving information that he is not supposed to know?).\n\n**Game experience:** Rather fast paced, even though you don't respawn. Random maps, no need for prior knowledge and training. Simple bullet spread mechanics. Possible to rush your way to the victory, on unpredictible maps where creativity and talent makes the difference."
ke5vzz,Sum game,"I had a game idea where u build machines (kinda like scrap mechanic or besiege) and fight with them. A machine would know where the player is and so u could set it to follow you or something. Maybe some kind of AI? Also, maybe the player could be a smaller robot themselves? Maybe there would be an option to ""select as smol"" and ""select as big"" and the cockpit of the machine would be replaced with a brain in the smol version. In the big version, you would play in first person, and in smol version, you would play in third person or first person. And of course, since its a mechanic game, you have your pistons, rotation thingies, and other things like that.\n\nIn short: A mechanic game where the AI knows where you are."
ke5rr1,Drain,"I don't think the concept is very large but can scale to any format, so it's very flexible.\n\nA 2D or 3D (whichever you'd prefer) platformer where you play as a plumber in the year 2080 and you get stuck in the massive sewers that cities (now abandoned) hold, and you have to survive the giant labyrinth by learning from your surroundings like mutant plants or a ball of worms. I wanted the game to feel like a classic Mario or MegaMan game, but have a different sense of Metroidvania with the sewer. There will be a set of tools you can use while down in the sewers to unlock more of the sewers in order to get out. Now, the narrative would be about a girl plumber who loses her mind in the sewers (which is why it's called ""drain"") trying to get out.\n\nI have a ton more I'd like to share if you're interested but these are just a few of the key concepts, I just didn't want to overdo it, and follow examples left by the Moderators. In total though, I'd love to contribute to making the game by providing maps, tools, a weapon, puzzles, and enemies I've made."
ke4z1p,Additions to Sonic,"**Sonic, The Blue Blurr**\n\nPlease, I ask you to review my work and ask anything you need, I'd love for you to give me feedback on anything you think as it helps me get a better grasp at the whole concept. I understand that these simple concepts won't get me anywhere, but I refuse to hide them away, I need feedback and I usually can't get the feedback I need from the people around me. I really need to be a game director and test so much motions games can go through, but I understand that my ideas might not make it to director boards, so I'll love sharing them with others so that they can learn from my work and maybe make something that I wanted to make.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Losing Rings** take time to pick up, and you can’t continue since they’re your health, but the game is about speed, so how about we make it so that collecting rings without stopping gives you invincibility or a set of lives every time you get up to 25 rings, or maybe, get rid of rings all together to make sure sonic doesn’t have to collect things on the way but find things like shortcuts, this can be applied by being rewarded for running for a time to invincibility or durability against the enemy’s attacks. Or if you’d like to, mix the two with collecting every 10 rings gives you a boost or increase in durability where you can beam through enemies for each collection of 10 rings(maybe for tougher enemies it’ll take 25 rings or something( or maybe a reward that regenerates every 5 seconds or so)) or use a homing attack(if we’re talking about bigger enemies it may also be taking 10 rings from you to charge your attack which gives you a speedy boost as well) to rid them if you want to save your durability, only when you’re not stopping so that the course is learning how to collect rings and the map all while not stopping.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Boosts** are a control of how fast you’d like to go so that players can choose their comfortability, whether you’re a honed skilled player who wants to use your boost to reach unlimited speeds to literally speed run the game, or you would rather use your own level of speed and instead use the boosts that collect every 5 seconds to be able to collect attacks without using your energy or maybe more invincibility, this way it’s a sacrifice to your speed for defense or sacrifice your defense for your speed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Light speed dashes** should be a fantastic addition, therefore a way to fix the slowing down can be a mechanism that you have to wait 3-5 seconds (while running so that it doesn’t affect your game) to charge(for free rather than using rings) or just be using rings you’ve collected to dash instantly, a great boost and attack for ground enemies, why else would sonic look like a literal comet when he’s running?. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Sliding** should be used (maybe just as a drift in 3D)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* We can also change the rings for time running, but to not make you feel like you only run, the set up to the run is changed to a button you’ll have to press, so if you don’t want to run and solve the puzzles you can walk around safely, if you want to run across the map to pick up a puzzle piece(with a backpack or send tails, but ultimately I wouldn’t touch this unless it’s a last resort) or interaction with the world like Zelda dungeons you can run. Essentially this can be a bigger interaction version of Zelda dungeons which can be wild if done right. Then since that’s the running button, pressing it again can be the Light Speed Dash. The difference between running for the time would be the incredible skill for controlling your speed rather than your skill for the level. Take that “speedrunners”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Ziplines** may just be removed or can provide a boost for the player that doesn’t make the player feel slower and instead is an addition or tool for the player to get to a faster pace.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Maps** are something we might have to figure out as we test sonic’s new abilities\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Puzzle mechanism** of the classic rotating wheel, but you have to hit the middle bar that rotates the wheels to change which order it goes. This is an idea that can solve many of the sonic issues about their little mechanisms, they usually slow down the player, but I’m trying to encourage the player to get through the level at their own speed to understand it better and let them have the option to go fast.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Snowball** level where sonic can run into a snowball and start rolling with it to crush enemies down its path- grants durable invincibility and slows down or rises speed based on your usual speed. Though snowballs may be a tool, they’re also an occurrence against sonic as he runs up a mountain and his enemies keep rolling snowballs. The snowballs are huge but slow while being an annoyance by being hard to get through at the bottom of the mountain so that they’re easier to dodge for slower players, but as he rises up the mountain, the snowballs get faster and easier to get through eventually becoming nothing compared to sonic, this causes an introduction paradox where if the player is knocked back they can still have enough time as the snowballs are slower behind them. I understand that the snowballs will be going after him and running towards them will be difficult, but I’d like to have this map as an introduction to the new sonic so that players try to understand how to play before trying to run straight into the action. I doubt this would work and players won’t like being non-accessible to his speeds, which is why it’ll be a one-time level Experience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Just Sonic,** maybe we can make this fit as younger Sonic or something on the lines of his backstory(Which could also influence the shounen protagonist in Sonic like how Goku was), because I really like sticking to the lore, but this would definitely help the player feel that it’s Sonic who is the center of the game, that he is the reason you feel this joyful and excited to play this game. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Ranking** your score based on alphabetical order would be broken by the speed limitations, so now you’ll be tested to beat your own scores through each course, this means the first level you play will place your first highest score in the game giving you an S tier, this should make players want to test their skill, have their own favorite maps they like to play, and be able to replay that map over and over again as they reach for a better overall score. This case would mean that any score higher than your previous highest would be an S tier. Then as you get better, the only thing that would happen would be the change in distance of the relations of the score, so the higher your score becomes over time the shorter the distance between each score, and the harder it is to get a higher score as you test yourself to your limit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Mission** **Missions** will be placed on the world, a world? Think of the legend of Zelda’s BOTW and now imagine being able to run across the world with many challenges awaiting you, a free world structure that only requires you to free the world, and everything unlocked after you beat the game(or maybe the world). What I’m planning is either a world as a tutorial for players where they can test their capabilities in insane parkours around the map or be introduced into different mechanics. If the Sonic team would like a story rather than just an exploration through a huge world, then we can just make the world smaller (only a mission to beat at the beginning of the game as a tutorial), and have Dr. Egg man find Sonic and his strange speed to kidnap him for whatever reason. I’m also a pretty interesting writer, so I think I can probably also plot this. Anyways, this could just be a setup for Sonic’s running and the abilities can be introduced as Dr. Eggman could test Sonic as he tests the other animals, or whatever those things are. Then sonic can understand his plan (whatever that may be) and ruin it to run away, now sonic has to find his way back home and run away from Eggman who is trying to find Sonic. &lt;— lazy writing, but I think we could do better as a team.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **No water missions** unless we could get through the problems they hold against speed\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Disability** might be a huge problem with the game, well at least for the other games since this one isn’t made yet, but I’d love to dive deeper into this if I do get interested in Sonic more often (That means inspirations or things to fix, as I think the creators have this covered)\n\nSide- this means ideas that aren’t fully formed or really compelling to me\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Maybe wall-running, bouncing off walls, or wall-running and jumping off of them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Maybe add goggles to this speed devil"

kdquik,Trading card game,"Here is a simple idea for a trading card game. Its obviously inspired by monopoly but fairly different.\n\n\nEach player starts the game with 1 card of each colors. Values of the cards is in brackets. White (1), Yellow (2), Orange (3), Red (4), Black (5). Additionnally, each players starts with 5$.\n\n\nThe objective of the game is to have the most value when the game ends. Your value is determined by your money + total value of your cards. Additionnally, having 3 cards of the same color gives a bonus of 3 points. Its possible to have negative money (debt). Debt not only reduce your score, but its effect is double (2$ of debt removes 4 points from your score).\n\n\nThe cards and the money of each players is secret during the game.\n\n\nEach turns, you have to secretly craft a deal. Either you sell a card for a price of your choice, or you ask to buy a card for a price of your choice. For example, ""i want to buy red card for 4$"". Once all 3 players crafted their own deal, each players see 2 anonymous deals on their screens. You do not see who posted the deal. The first person to click on the deal gets it (speed game). If nobody clicks, then the deal is cancelled.\n\n\n\nThere is 7 rounds like this, then the game ends and scores are compared.\n\n\nObviously, the best strategy is to try and get 3 cards of the same colors, but also to try and sell your other cards for excess value."

kdk6co,A dating simulator that turns into a vertical scrolling shooter,"I’ve had this idea for a while now. I don’t know if anything like this has already been done before.\n\nThe idea is that the game starts as an average dating simulator, but when the player goes on a date the game turns into a vertical scrolling shooter similar to games such as Xevious and Galaga. During the dates the player has to reach a certain number of points to succeed, which can be done by shooting down enemies or certain obstacles. You also have to dodge bullets that the enemies send at you. If you don’t reach the number of points you need, the date ends in a failure. I think there can also be items that can upgrade the character during the dates and also some enemies that make you lose points if you shoot at them. Another idea I have is that you can give gifts to the characters before the date, and it will either make the shooting part easier or harder depending on if they like the gift or not."
kdi39s,A Top-Down Bullet Hell At Sea Where Bullets are Affected By Gravity,"Hello! I've really been into bullet hells lately, and this idea came into mind.\n\nYou're a guy on a tiny speedboat at sea and you have to take out huge ships with your cannon. As in all bullet hells, it's chaos as bullets fill the screen. It'll be your job to dodge them all.\n\nThe difference is that while most bullet hells use only the x and y-axis, this top-down game will have the z-axis as well. Bullets can fly above you before heading straight down your boat, enemy barrages have a set range, as any farther than that will have them sink to the ground.\n\nThis will lead to new strategies for both the developer and the player. The developer can then put way more bullets onscreen, with most still high in the air and some at the level that can hit your boat. It'll make the player consider the bullet's z-axis as well, so you can go under bullets still in the air while dodging a barrage somewhere else, move right outside the enemy's range, and so on."
kdfcbo,"Zombie game, but you’re a proper zombie","So yeah, we got some games where you’re a zombie, but you can’t infect people, you don’t get to watch a horde of fellow zombies tear through a human outpost, and in other games where you’re a zombie or have a horde of zombies, the humans just mow them down in a split-second \n\nSo my idea is a zombie game, a simulator if you will, you can have a sandbox mode where you can adjust the human populace and how far/close their outposts are to each other and how well defended they are(from just being a camp with no walls and makeshift weapons to being a heavily armed outpost with tall wood walls armed with pikes and traps), you can also adjust certain things about their behavior, like will group A raid group B’s outpost(leaving a bunch of corpses for you to turn) or will group A share resources with group B(this will make things more difficult for the player) or will group A and B be neutral with each other\n\nAs for the player, they can choose between a couple different zombie variations, I’m thinking of the current selection being crawler for stealth, tank for ravaging outposts, spitter for infecting/killing at long range whilst being frailer than glass, leaper for speed and stealth but being more easy to spot in the day time since they can’t hide well\n\nThe player will have a couple of abilities, some class ability ideas I got are that tanks will be able to unleash an infectious cloud to turn all the humans they killed, crawlers can spit out infectious blobs that infect whoever steps on them and anyone else nearby, spitters can spit out gas that lingers for a while, turns corpses but doesn’t affect the living, and empowers any zombies in the gas, and leapers can go invisible while still able to infect people and corpses\n\nSome “universal” abilities that are spread between all classes would be, the ability to call zombies to your area, the ability to send zombies to different locations, and the ability to move faster for a short period \n\nI’ll probably update this soon, feedback for this idea would be appreciated"

kdcral,"""Junk"" System for Open World/Sandbox games to handle unloading items","Over the last few years, I have come up with a lot of concepts for sandbox and open world games, especially in the same vein as Minecraft or Terraria. However, more interesting than any of those holistic ideas, one mechanic I had made up for one of the first ones kept coming back and being refined in each concept I had. At this point, I am much more interested in this mechanic than the rest of any of those games, since it solves multiple major gripes I have with every game in this genre I've played so far.  \n\n\nBasically, what if, when a game was going to despawn an item, it added that item to a table of items despawned in that location? The item would no longer be taking up processing power, instead becoming part of the world file. Then, things that draw random 'junk' items from a table (such as junk/loot fishing in Minecraft, or slimes containing items in Terraria) could remove items from that table instead of a static loot table (that makes anything in that table renewable). Items in the junk table could have a chance of being found by fishing, digging, fighting certain kinds of monsters, or any other way that makes sense for the game.  \n\n\nThis solves several major problems I have with these games, especially Minecraft, those being the inability to retrieve items once they despawn, and the random assortment of items made directly renewable through being included on a loot table. If Minecraft were to add this system, it could more carelessly despawn items (maybe even immediately upon a chunk being unloaded) to save memory, and instead use the fishing system (and upcoming archaeology system) to recover lost items. In the Nether, where neither of those options are available, the piglin bartering loot table could be replaced with a junk table representing the entire dimension.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis System also adds a lot of interesting design possibilities. For example, some loot in dungeons/ruins could be hidden in the junk table, encouraging players to stick around and make them a temporary home to find the items. Also, monsters could arm themselves with items in the junk table as if they had found them. If a game were built around this system, it could even go so far as to run creature spawning tables, allowing specific monsters to continue stalking a location semi-permanently, or having a limited number of passive creatures available to hunt in an area before the population is depleted.   \n\n\nThere are a few problems I've noticed with this system as it stands, but I'm much more interested in any constructive criticism/feedback you all might have."
kdc7om,Any 2D Ideas for a new game designer?,Just getting into game design and I was curious if anyone has any good ideas that I can play around with?
kkst5b,"Two character game, one blind, one deaf","So basically a first person game where you have two characters ( one is blind and one is deaf) and your naviagating through a mansion or cave or seomthing trying to escape together. Obviously your characters are together, maybe linked so deaf character leads blind chracter. Your job is to escape the place your by finding hints and tools and what not about the location by seeing objects using the deaf character, and then swapping minds with the blind character to listen out for any noises coming from places, which would get louder or quieter if you turn towards it and move closer or further away from it, and then you can swap back to the deaf person, see where your blind friend has moved to, and figure out where the sound you heard was coming from and it would lead to more discoveries into helping you get out. The deaf character would have absolutely no sound in game, including menu and opening inventory and stuff, while the blind character could have a blank screen (maybe something on it to not completely make it black, or even better have a sound wave type thing appear if your facing a sound with the source (a dot) so you know where to move to to show the deaf counterpart the location). Hope that makes sense."

kkj80y,A VR GAME ABOUT COMPUTER VIRUS,"So I’m looking for more detailed idea about the game I’m going to develop. This is for my thesis project.

I’m thinking of a specific thing like files that would be attack by the said virus (I still thinking what files and what virus) Im thinking of three specific part of computer that would be attack by viruses. This would be the 3 stages/settings of the game. Also, I’m going to put an anti virus switch to each stages so that once the player find it, it would help him wipe the virus fast as possible. In addition, I’m thinking of a gun (still thinking what gun) that the player might use to kill the virus once he was attack by them. Also, what virus will I use and what are their characterization and their attacks. I hope someone would help me.. Thanks..\nAlso, pls recommend me good game title."

kkg1mx,A cartography/politics based game,"Basically it's a puzzle/strategy game in which you have to divide a territory into regions that satisfy certain conditions given by the government, while also balancing the needs of the people.\n\nExample:\nObjective: Divide a colony into smaller regions \n\nRequirements:\nMinimum of x regions\nMaximum of x regions\nNo exclaves/enclaves\nArea greater than x sq km/mi\nPopulation greater that x\nStability greater than x%\n\n\nAfter getting this information, the player would be given a map of the area, as well as heatmaps dispalying certain data. Examples of heatmaps might include population, religion, language, ethnicity, and political beliefs. Factors such as natural boundaries and tension should also be considered. The player would then have to balance all the data, while also adhering to the objectives.\n\nAnother style of play might be merging smaller areas into larger ones.\n\nThis idea popped into my head after I watched https://youtu.be/daeB46Z4fjs (specifically 4:08), and I thought it would genuinely make a good puzzle game if it were more in depth.\n\nHopefully this was semi clear, and feel free to ask for more details"

kka813,Terrible hacking/mimigame idea for PC,"All you have to do is type words as fast as possible. As you do, the screen fills in with code, as your character actually hacks. There are two twists: first, the game doesn't tell you what words to type. It checks that they are valid words against a stored dictionary, and may impose additional restrictions - only nouns or verbs, or containing certain letters. (This prevents you easily going from a dictionary)\n\nThe second twist is, the game remembers every word you've ever used before this game, and you don't get progress/get penalties for anything you've used before."

Or 3 strikes and you're out?   \nHow many players should there be in a game? How should the drafting how?   \n\n\nI am asking questions just to point into a direction I am leaning and having trouble with. I'd love to hear your opinions and the ideas you've had with the genre.

kjyboc,An open-world RPG where random things/bugs happen all the time.,"So the title might not give away much, but I had absolutely zero interest in playing Cyberpunk 2077 on release. Now that I’ve seen a lot of the funny bugs and glitches though they’ve made me actually want to play it and see what kind of random things happen. It got me thinking - what if there was a game like this and it was all intentional and that was part of the experience/challenge?"
kjxaf2,Racetrack manager,This is an idea I've been thinking of for quite a while. You design and manage a racetrack. Something like Prison Architect. I don't think there has been a racetrack manager yet. It could be quite cool to see.\n\nBasicly you start with nothing just some money. You build the layout of the track. Then you sign contracts with racing series. Those series have requirements. For example the track must be lit up.\n\nAnd as you get to more advanced series that pay more they will have more requirements.

Think of the side quests! Hiding the nuns who are trying to escape the monestary in barells (true story, Martin Luther's wife was one of them) and the MAP!!

kjpvjy,Whispers of The Past,"\nSingle player/ semi-open world/  dinosaur survival shooter\n\nPlatforms: probably a PC release to begin with and moved to consoles like PlayStation later down the line.\n\nShort synopsis: \nA survival shooter(first person) set in an abandoned country near Russia. The main enemy would be dinosaurs and other prehistoric creatures (with maybe a few ones from the future so let your imagination run wild). The map itself would be big enough to be semi open world but not so big it’s not realistically achievable or maybe a bunch of smaller maps loaded in different “chapters” of the story.\n\n\nAtmosphere: a depressing post-Soviet industrial city with bombed out buildings, Soviet architecture and an overall sort “Chernobyl” vibe.\n\nGameplay/concept:\n\n Starting off well armed and with plenty of ammo but as time goes on you have to craft bandages and other healing items, scavenge food, conserve ammo, regularly maintain your firearms, and if desperate enough, craft makeshift weapons from spare parts you loot. There are some other small survival game details I would want like building fires and backpack space management. Maybe even some light customization of weapons like adding nails to a scavenged bat or attaching a flashlight or new sights to a gun.\n\nI would want combat with the dinosaurs and other creatures to happen rarely so that it doesn’t become Call of Duty: Jurassic Park but also be just often enough so the game isn’t boring. I would want a variety of dinosaur species as well as other things like giant insects or ice age mammals and maybe even some creatures from the future. (Also not sure if encounters should be scripted or random, or maybe a mix of both?)\n\nThere could maybe be a teamwork aspect but I’m not sure. The story could go that you are part of a unit that you go through game with or they die early on in some accident, leaving you stranded. Maybe there could also be some variation to the gameplay in certain areas like finding a still functional tank and using it to fight off waves of enemies or finding the best ways to fortify buildings from incoming enemy attacks. Or perhaps elements of stealth in a light horror section.\n\n\n\nObjective: although I don’t have a clear cut objective yet I do have a bit of a template that you can add to if you want. A research facility in the heart of an post-Soviet city caused some major rift in time to create portals to different eras in time. This caused the city and country to be overrun with dinosaurs and similar creatures and we would be tasked with finding our way to the facility and shutting down the machine keeping the rift open.\n\n\nFor this next part (the story) again think of it as a template that can be changed to make it better or more fitting. This is sort of just a starting point.\n\nStory: (it’s kind of long so buckle up)\nthere is this small country right on Russia’s doorstep ( still thinking of the name) that was part of the former Soviet Union. During WW2 the nazis marched on this country and committed many atrocities to the civilian population, when the red army came back to reclaim the country they treated the civilians almost just as poorly as the nazis did.\n\nWhen the Soviet Union broke apart this little country became very xenophobic and basically shut itself off from the outside world. Though it had a major steel industry and would often export said material as well as a small airport where small groups of visitors could come and go. One day this airport stopped taking in air traffic, the country’s radio stations went silent, and they stopped the export of steel. \n\nThough, people right on the border said they could often see anti aircraft fire and hear gunshots. This was worrying to the UN who wanted to send in blue helmets to see what happened but Russia said it was too close to their border and made it very clear they wouldn’t hesitate to start WW3 if UN forces got that close to their border. In the end though, the radio silence made Russia worried that the small country was preparing for war and sent spy planes.\n\n The country seemed to be at war, except it seemed the enemy was within their own borders as roads and buildings were turned to rubble from bombing and artillery fire, abandoned tanks littered the streets, and there were abandoned checkpoints and machine gun positions. Russia got curious enough to send in a small strike team (that the player is a part of) this would start off the gameplay. \n\nAt first little things would seem off such as electrical equipment randomly malfunctioning and seeing bodies already skeletons despite the fact it had only been a few weeks. All of this would build up to create tension until your first combat encounter, where a dinosaur would pounce the player and after killing it, more waves of them would attack a hastily fortified building you were in. \n\nAfter more exploration and combat you would discover that time portals had opened up and sent the small country in to chaos after dinosaurs (as well as some other prehistoric and possibly future creatures) started to pour through and take over the country. \n\nThe rest of the game would be spent trying to stop the time portals and eventually you do. At this point however, your radio still doesn’t work and most of your team is dead so it goes to a cutscene of your character returning to Russia on foot over the course of several days, but once you do get back home, you realize that the time portals had also opened up in your homeland. You realize this just in time to see the flash of a nuclear strike at a nearby city, showing how bad things have gotten, and then fade to black and credits."
kjpfxh,A rogue like looter shooter,I came up with an idea for a looter shooter set in a van helsing setting but with a unique twist. When you make a character you have to go through a rogue like dungeon where you decide your class and weapons through it. Every so often the game will give you the option to leave the dungeon with what you have but if you die between these checkpoints game over. Outside the dungeon is a hunters shack where you can vault items so if you die you don't get sent to the beginning. And late game content once your happy with your hunter. A wave defence mode with perma death terned off (think cod zombies) where at the end you are rewarded loot based off your performance. Raids and strongholds where perma death is turned on but highly reward those who want to risk it. A bounty hunt mode (think hunt showdown) again with perma death. If you die in perma death game modes you will be sent back to the dungeon beginning where you can fight against your hunter in an empowered state and if you fail you lose him forever resulting in a reset in progress. Based off your level though you will get better gear quicker so it's not a hard reset + your vault which holds items cross hunter.

kjnqn3,This Thing of Ours,"A game with GTA vibes, but old school Mafia roots. Organized crime, 1920’s-1950’s start off small time, running errands during prohibition for the “made guys” in the neighborhood, choose a NY family (Bonanno, Colombo, Gambino, Genovese and Lucchese), follow the story line up until the Castellammarese War. After the Castellammarese War and the creation of the Commision by Lucky Luciano, go to more of a free roam and build relationships with the families until you’re a made guy. each family has its own perks for example, discounted weapons, or access to exclusive rackets, exc. \n\nBuild relationships with the 5 families and pick and choose whether to remain on good terms or walk the line with decision based missions. \n\nMain goal is to become a made guy while balancing relationships and remain in good standings with the commission. Depending on your choices, end up “pinched” turning fed witness with a price on your head, retiring and buying your way out, or get outright “whacked” with a sanctioned hit by the commission. \n\nAdded DLC could be the ability to head on over to the Chicago Outfit with Capone. \n\nKeep it historically accurate as possible."
kjkm4u,Frankenstein vs. Dracula,"This would be a 16-bit side-scrolling brawler, like those of the early '90s (X-Men, Double Dragon, TMNT). You would play as Frankenstein's monster, and the enemies are either villagers/normal citizens or Dracula's army of undead.\n\nDracula here is similar to Castlevania where he has a castle fortress in Transylvania and an army of undead servants of all kinds. He has kidnapped Victor Frankenstein to make use of his arcane genius. This takes place during the period when you, the creature, were preparing to confront Victor and demand he create a mate for you (around midway through Mary Shelley's novel).\n\nNow, you have to make your way East to rescue Victor, or you will forever be alone. You must make your way from Geneva first to Ingolstadt, then Vienna, Budapest, and finally Transylvania.\n\nYou are head-and-shoulders taller than everyone else, and have a tremendous reach. You can bound easily across the landscape and climb effortlessly. You can pick up things and throw them, including your enemies."
kjkawd,Need feedback on a mechanic,"Context: I am making a game where the player has a mech suit that they can use to cast different abilities that cost ""electricity"" which is sort of like mana\n\nI was thinking about being able to adjust the ""suit voltage"" so you can modify the abilities a little bit but I'm not sure which model to pick\n\n**Model 1:** 3 different voltages. Low, normal, and high. Normal would be the normal ability. Low would be a low power version that would use a little less electricity(more efficient) and maybe a little less damage. High would use more electricity than normal and also maybe have a little bonus like some knockback or stun.\n\nThis is the model I had in mind when I thought of this game, however I feel like along with everything else going on in the game, people might just pick 1 of the 3 voltages and stick with that\n\n**Model 2:** 2 different voltages to keep it simple. Normal and High. Normal is normal but High would be something like 3x the cost for 3.5x damage as well as minor bonus like knockback or stun.\n\n This would be a high risk/ high reward bc if you were to miss an ability skillshot or something, you would lose a lot of electricity. This would also mean people would default to normal bc always using high would drain your electricity fast.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Which model sounds better and why?"

kj42p2,Time-travel game,"Here's a story I wrote for my game, what do you guys think? I'll post more details shortly so you can understand better.  \n\nYear is 30XX. Technology is booming. Scientists created a device known as The Eye of Time. It allows the wearer to revisit the memories they shared with the DNA host (even if dead) by visiting a dimension known as the DNA Loop (DNAL), but as a ghost, i.e. you can't communicate nor change the past. You also can't  enter your own DNAL, you'll die immediately. \n\n**Part 1: The O-Virus**\n\nA tech corporation known as ECORP develops the ""OV"" (overload virus) that overloads the eye and allows you to visit **ANY** period that the host has ever been to without needing to have co-existed in that period with the person. The O-virus only works if the DNA host is alive. Still, as a ghost. ECORP plans to use that in blackmailing all the rich and powerful people of the society.\n\n**Part 2: X's Heart of time**\n\nOne of the scientists in ECORP known as ""X"" (who also created the EOT devices) realizes the danger of the O-virus and starts developing a device known as ""The Heart of Time"" that allows him to travel to the past and prevent the creation of the EOTs. When ECORP finds out, Knowing that the heart requires X's DNA, they choose to kidnap him instead of killing him, and they steal the heart.\n\n**Part 3: The blueprint**\n\nDuring the fight at X's house, X cuts his hand, covers an overloaded EOT in his blood, then screams at Amelia after handing it to her: *""Run, Amelia, Run! As soon as you find cover use the eye and look for the blueprint""*\n\nAmelia runs away, finds cover, uses the eye, X feels her going in.\n\nWhile she's in, ECORP extract a syringe of X's blood to run the heart. Meanwhile, Amelia finds the blueprint and clicks the eye just in time to go out, as soon as X feels her going out, he kills himself, which immediately expires the DNA and stops the heart from operating.\n\n**part 4 - The daughter**\n\nECORP look for and kidnap Amelia to use hers instead. Even with Amelia's DNA, he heart still doesn't work so they attempt to visit her DNAL via the the bugged eye to only realize that Amelia's not X's biological daughter and that she's adopted. She overhears ECORP techs talking and gets devastated.\n\nNow that Amelia is no longer useful, ECORP decide to kill her. She attempts to escape from the lab prison by shocking one of the techs."
kj3mwg,Infinite Dendrogram,"A Complete story/online-living, with the center goal of becoming the strongest alive or your very own goals. Let's start with how it would be processed, say the world is equal to our very own. You could manage and store data by land mass, basically, you could have data centers on every major country to act as a main center for data near those areas within the game itself. This could manage the world processes and data with ease instead of a main server to manage everything. The very landscape could be transported to the cilent, minus all the buildings. However, if they do decide to build, it could be saved on the data station that they are the closest to.  \n\n\nNow to the player experience parts, the world could be their very own. They would build their own world, with the help of NPCs as well. The NPCS of the world could be managed by mini processing stations to render thousands of npcs at once. The NPCs could even build their own towns if given time to. This next part could be hard to do and probably wouldn't be done in this day and age. Though it might be possible in the future, this idea is to give NPCs permanent data. As if they were to die, thats it, but only death bans for players. Three day bans could be given to players that were killed. No weapon restrictions, no balancing, no admin inference (Not counting managing cheaters). The very weapon base could be managed and created by the players.   \n\n\nIf you like anime, you might be seeing where Im getting these ideas from. Heck, the name of the anime could be the name of the game. Infinite Dendrogram is the name of the anime i'm sourcing and sightly editing information from, in this game, the players are the ones ruling and shaping the reality around them. With special powers I should add.   \n\n\nThe powers themselves don't have to be added, but it would add so much to the fun factor of the game. Having your very own power to your player would be amazing. Multiple types, their very own ups and downs. I understand this could very well take 10 to 20 years, but the outcome (and money income) would be incredible. Just imagine it, your very own house that you built with your friends and family. You could very well even have VR support, this would change the very core of gaming and could turn tides of the disappointment of games.  \n\n\nGood looking graphics would also stop it from being disappointing, but if given the time and care that every game should get. It could and would change the world of gaming. I understand this probably wouldn't be possible now, but in the future. This could be very well the most downloaded and played game ever.   \n\n\nIf anyone, ANYONE is working on this. I would LOVE to know what you've done and allow me to watch, I know such a game would exist in the future, but I can't stop to think if someone is already working on such a game."

kit38h,"A GameMaster vs Players CO-OP dungeon crawler game. Where GM gather resources &amp; distributes items for the players, while players buy their skills and items to help them progress","This is more of a early concept that I've had in mind for about a month, but still not sure what the end goal could be, maybe a big boss battle? Hopefully you guys can share your thoughts about my idea. I play D&amp;D and this is very much inspired by it.\n\n# Overview\nI'm thinking a 3-5 player game where one person is a GameMaster and the rest is (2-4) players. GM is chosen or are randomly chosen. The GM can pick a series of maps the players should get through. A series can contain 3-5 maps with varying sizes. The maps themselves are a bunch of rooms which are connected via corridors or doors to another room. To continue to next map the players must find the exit (stairs down).\n\nPlayers can buy items which the GM ***MUST*** place somewhere in the map during setup. The items can be placed on minions, in treasure chests, or floating on the floor.\n\n# GM\nTo make it fun for the GM while the game is on I'm thinking the GM can control all minions as it were an RTS game. E.g. Move workers to another spot to hide them from the players while sending groups of minions to distract them. GM has full vision over the whole map.\n\nWhile during setup, the GM can:  \n* Place resources, minions, treasure chests, traps (can be placed anywhere, but resources are limited to 1 resource/room)  \n* Spend resources gathered from previous map to buy extra resources, minions, treasure chests, or traps  \n* The GM must add items the Players have bought  \n\nResources are locations that can be harvested or produce items by the GMs minions.   \nMinions ranging from simple workers that gather/produce items to weak-to-stronger enemies for defeating the players.  \nTreasure chests can be locked requiring a player to unlock it (buying GM some time to move enemies towards the party).  \nTraps can affect both the players and GMs minions making them deadly for both parties.  \n\nExamples of resources:  \n* Gathering wood  \n* Gathering iron ore  \n* Gathering coal  \n* Producing iron ingots (iron ore + coal)  \n* Producing swords (wood or iron ingots)\n* Producing shields (wood or iron ingots + wood)\n\nExamples of traps:  \n* Spike trap  \n* Swinging axe  \n* Arrows shot from walls triggered by a pressure plate (placed separately)\n\n# Players\nThe players role are pretty straight forward. They have to work together to survive the GMs minions and traps while destroying GMs resources. For the most immersion I'm thinking the players play using a Third Person-camera or First Person-camera (or both). Unable to view the whole map.\n\nDuring setup the players can:  \n* Buy items (items that GM must place on the map)  \n* Buy/upgrade skills they'd want to use  \n* Share items that was picked up from previous map\n\nThe players gain coins after completing the map. Destroying resources, killing minions, collecting items, dodging/disabling traps adds additional coins they can use for the next map. Players can discuss which items to buy and who gains the most from buying/upgrading skills. The items they picked up from last map can be shared between them. They share their loot &amp; coin!\n\nExamples of items:  \n* Potions (healing, attack+, defense+, etc)  \n* Armor  \n* Weapons  \n* Ammunition (for ranged weapons, spells)  \n* Trinkets (neck, rings)  \n\nExamples of skills (can be both direct or AoE):  \n* Healing skills  \n* Stun skills  \n* Heavy attack/extra damage skills  \n* Spells (Fireball, etc)  \n* Etc...  \n\n# End\nThanks for reading.

kikdnh,Unlimited Role-Playing Experience,"I love role playing games because they give you a large amount of freedom. The game i've been conceptualizing would do just that. I'm thinking it would start out mobile, as it would enable a larger audience to play, and because role playing games that maximize freedom are fairly limited on mobile devices.\n\nThe concept of the game is quite grand. The player, set in a fantasy world, will have almost complete freedom to do whatever they want.\n\nPlayers would begin by customizing their character, (race, class, appearance, etc,) then selecting where on a generated map they would like to begin. From there, it's basically an open world experience.\n\nThere would be several screens from which users could switch between. The first would just be map screen with minimalist graphics. The player would be able to zoom in and out, and would be able to see a range of the world, from relatively local to continental. The second, and most used, would be a top down view of the area the player is in, With graphics that are more detailed than those of the map, but still simplistic. The third would be a 2D visualization of any interactions the character is having, whether that be opening a chest or talking to an NPC. This screen would be more detailed than the last, but again, still relatively simplistic. The fourth screen would be an inventory screen, that would show any of a vast amount of items the character had acquired and equipped. (Again, simplistic) The fifth would be a screen that would show accepted quests, or something like that, to help the player remember interactions they'd had earlier.\n\nThats already a lot, huh. Yes. The game would be no small feat, but I have no doubt people would eat it up.\n\nThe player will be able to encounter a vast amount of situations, places, npcs, etc. etc. etc, many of which would be randomly generated to provide a unique experience for each individual player. \n\nPlayers would be able to accept quests and get rewards, forge alliances, romance, battle, etc. \n\nOkay. I'm looking back at that now and other than graphics, such a game would be in no way simplistic. My guess is it will probably stay forever a dream, though it's kinda an awesome dream nonetheless. Who knows, maybe someone will make something out of this small post. If you do, let me know."
kic614,"This is a little different, its an outdoor game i call ""reach""","Its basically tag, but if you miss, the person you were trying to hit gets a point.\n\nHow to play\nOne person is the dedicated tagger, and the other is the dodger. The tagger has to tag the dodger (or dodgers) and not miss, while the dodger has to dodge to get points. When the dodger gets tagged, the tagger gets a point and the dodger has to tag the tagger to get points.first to sixteen points wins. Normally one tag or dodge each would be one point, but you can change it up. If you call ""reach"" then the other person has to tell you if they reached or not, and you have to tell the truth. No calling pause or time out, thats cheating and a cowards move\n\nAdvanced\n\nEveryone can tag or dodge, both equal one point, and you cant tag someone repeatedly over and over again, thats too easy.\nIf you call ""flinch"" then the other person has to stand still and you can either tag or pretend to tag them. If they flinch while you were pretending to tag them, then you fet a point and the game continues. If they dont flinch, then they get a point. If you tag them, you get a point. If they dodge you, you get a point, and you cant try to tag them, and them say you were only pretending. You cant call flinch over and ober again, you can only call it five times (this is debatable)\nAnything you think is a good idea , put in the comments."

kiau0q,A creatures food chain simulation game with cards,"Hi all, \n\nSo I was looking at a few games where you basically create a fish tank and just look at it. Nothing more. This made me think, what if you had a more active role in the tank's life cycle?\n\nThe idea is to simulate the food chain of a set of creatures in a contained environment. For example, imagine that the savanna is your environment. You provide the player with trees, lions, giraffes, rhinos, elephants, hyenas, etc... and the player places them around in the environment. Each of these animals eats another animal or plant. So you want to mind the ratios as you try to balance the whole thing so no one species would die out or have the entire biome go extinct fro example.\n\nThe trick is that you don't give out the different animals or insects like in say Equilinox, but through cards. The player pulls random cards from a deck and those cards are basically what you have to use (or discard). So kinda work with what you have to balance the environment and make it last for as long as possible. Pulled the lion card? So now you gotta make sure there are a few preys around for him to eat. Oh, but wait, you got a plant card this time. OK, may as well put it far from the lions so the herbivores have a standing chance and survive a bit longer. This time, though, you got the hyenas and you have lots of preditors already. Maybe just sit this card for now till the herbivores are higher in numbers. You see what do I mean?\n\nWhat do you think of the idea?\n\nI am thinking this might be cool if done with an under the sea/ocean environment? Or perhaps Dinosaurs? Or maybe make some creatures up? Can't settle on which is cooler/better. What is your preference?"

The guns all look organic and shoot liquid a bit like Splatoon.\n\nEvery kill you gain makes your sperm bigger and more powerful and the egg can only big accessed when you have killed everyone and then and only then you will be strong enough to break through the egg.\n\nThere can be loot boxes spread through out the map to get better weapons and power ups. \nAlso different classes of sperms to pick at the beginning like Brainy sperm (wears glasses) , gangsta sperm ( wears thug life shades wiv spliff) Jock sperm ( wears sports wear) and so on and so on !\n\nThe game needs to be comical with lots of funny moments!!"

ki2s0i,Hollywood acting simulator – become a huge Hollywood star,"Hi brilliant people of this subreddit.\n\nFor many years I wanted to know and FEEL what it would be like to be a big, successful, Hollywood movie star. I wanted to feel the thrill of going on set, having the cameras and lighting all pointed at me, memorizing the script and act my way through interesting and varied scenes. I also wanted to have the feeling of walking on the red carpet at the movie launch after getting out of a limousine, surrounded by press, fans and paparazzi, mingling with other movie and co-stars and taking a lot of photos. And then? Enjoy the earnings of course. if I just made millions as an actor, I might as well spend it by living a luxury life, buying expensive cars and living in the most lavish looking mansions available on Beverly Hills.\n\nAnd then I thought… oh well, if I can't really do or be all of those things in real life, what's stopping me from creating a game about it? My imagination's the only limit here, so without further ado, let's put some use into it!\n \n*Early game*\n \nSo, after our little introduction, here we are. To start up the game, the players will be selecting between who they want to be, whether it's a starting actor or an actress.  Once the player chose the name for their character, they'll move over to customizing their character, including face, hair, body types and so on. Just before character customization ends, the player will also be able to choose traits for their newly created character, giving them the leverage on getting parts in specific types of movies and shows (for example, if your character is more on the funny side they'll be suitable for sitcoms and comedies, while on the contrary they could be more suitable for action movies or dramas if their traits are different)\n \n*Getting Contracts, Projects, and other gameplay aspects*\n \nRight, so we're done creating our upcoming movie star, what now? Starting from the bottom of course! at first, our newly created character will have a small rented apartment house in which he/she lives in, and a nice little car. The first thing you're going to want to do, is find a movie agent. You'll be able to look for one on your phone book, and then set up a meeting and sign a contract with your chosen agent. Once that is done and you managed to get a good contract, it is time for auditions of course. your agent will mail you every so often and offer you auditions for various parts, the first offers will be for small budget movies or shows, but overtime they'll get a lot more serious, depending on your experience and the progression that you've made.\n\nOnce you accepted an audition, you'll have to get there in time otherwise your credibility status might take a hit, which could affect you in the future.  \n\nDepending on the part that you'll be given, you'll have to follow the instructions given to you on set and do whatever you're asked to do, as accurate as you possibly can. Need to memorize lines? Do it. Need to jump between two moving cars like a stuntman? Do it. When you complete all the tasks that you've been given, you return home and wait for a phone call to see whether your performance was satisfactory and whether you actually got the part. In the meantime, you can go audition for other movies or shows. Once you receive a phone call that tells you that you're in, you'll start what's called a ""Project"".\n \n*Projects*\n\nA project is basically a closed contract between you and the studio that hired you, allowing you to perform your part for said project. Each part depending on the project will be hand made for that specific project, like a story. You'll be doing what you've been auditioning beforehand, but this time it'll be on set with cameras, other actors and actresses, takes, and the scenes themselves will take a lot longer to complete.\nPlayers may lose their contract if they perform poorly, arrive late for shooting days and so on. Once a player loses their contract, the project will be closed and the player's reputation might plummet, depending on the reason for the project's closing.\n \n*High life housing &amp; Fame*\n \nOnce players reach the end of a project successfully and complete all the tasks they’ve been given, the project (whether it's a movie or a seasoned series) will go live on TV or cinema and the players reputation and fame bars will start to rise steadily. The income will go straight to the players bank account, depending on the percentage agreed in the player's contract for that specific project. Received 250K for example? time to go shopping! Players will be able to purchase cars, new furniture, and participate in various luxurious activities that could cost a lot of money for the average person. If players managed to cross their first million dollars, it's time to start hunting for a new house in Beverly hills or even the Malibu. A lot of houses and mansions will be available to either rent or purchase, and depending on the amount of cash each player has, they'll be able to upgrade their living style as time progresses while they become richer and richer. Each house will be fully customizable and decorate-able, and each player can design their house completely to their liking with expensive items etc etc. players will also be able to invite other fellow actors and actresses to their house and throw occasional parties as well.\nLiving far from the studio might be great against unwanted attention from the paparazzi and the like, but it also increases traveling time to work, so that needs to be taken into account when buying a new property.\n \nSo, that's pretty much all for now. I'd love to hear your thoughts on this. There's still a lot to figure out and creating something in this magnitude ain't going to be an easy task since it's mostly a game of choice that contains a lot of branching paths and different outcomes for the various decisions players might make along the way. Still, if you like the idea in general, feel free to comment and make suggestions! Thank you for reading and have a fantastic day!"
ki2e00,Downgrade - a combat game where you downgrade your opponent,"# Intro\n\nThis is a design doc written out for the Weekly Game Jam. Seeing how the jam is almost over and I won't have time to implement this, I figured I'd share my idea here for if anyone wants to pick it up.\n\n# Concept\n\nIn Downgrade, 2 players fight each other in an arena. They get points for the percentage of the opponent’s health that is removed, plus a bonus if they manage to kill their opponent. After three rounds, the player with the most points wins. Each round is timed to keep up the pace.\n\nThe twist: both players start out with fully maxed-out upgrades and they can use points at the start of each round to purchase downgrades for their opponent.\n\n# Design considerations\n\n## Combat style\n\nMany kinds of combat-games lend themselves for this game. For example, this could be implemented as a first-person or third-person shooter or a top-down combat arena. It’s also very open to what kind of character the player controls. It could be a person or a tank for example.\n\n## Amount of players\n\nThe reason for suggesting 2 players is to avoid issues with multiple players ganging up on one single player and unloading all downgrades on that single player, effectively making it impossible for that player to win the game. If more than 2 players are to be supported, a solution to this should be implemented.\n\n## Win condition\n\nUsing points for both a win condition and purchasing downgrades will require players to put thought into buying downgrades: will they be able to earn back the points that they spend on downgrades by either using that advantage to obtain more points in return, or by limiting the amount of points their opponent will be able to earn.\n\n## Downgrade visibility\n\nKeeping downgrades hidden for the affected player can lead to players needing to experiment with their character to see whether any abilities have been changed. Some downgrades are immediately obvious, such as reduced movement speed or fire rate, while others can take some time to get figured out, such as reduced health if health numbers are not visible.\n\n# Fully upgraded\n\nThis is a suggestion for what a fully upgraded character can do:\n\n## Default weapon\n\nThe default weapon shoots plasma blasts in a straight line. Each blast acts as a projectile that can be dodged.\n\n## Auto-turret\n\nA drone hovers around the player and shoots bullet-speed projectiles at an opponent that is within a certain range. The auto-turret has a separate health pool from the player and can block projectiles.\n\n## Shield\n\nA shield hovers behind the player, blocking damage taken from behind.\n\n## Rocket\n\nEach round, both players receive a single-use rocket that moves slower than the plasma bolts and explodes upon collision, dealing damage in a radius around it.\n\n# Downgrades\n\nBelow are some suggestions for downgrades that can be bought.\n\n* Reduce movement speed by 50%\n* Reduce default weapon fire rate by 50%\n* Reduce default weapon projectile speed by 50%\n* Reduce health by 25%\n* Remove shield\n* Remove auto-turret\n* Reduce rocket blast radius by 50%"
ki1cqt,Player vs player story game.,"Maybe make a cabin in the woods game. It could be one vs one or 5 vs one.\nHow it will work is the player on the human team has control of the people and what he does will give the monster in the woods its properties. He will player one character at a time.\nThe 5 vs 1 would have the players team getting info on their character and they find more by talking to other players. They also make things happen on an item they touch in the cabin. \nEverytime a player finds information on dark stories. If they find one they get a random chance to start a monster round, but they won't know if one started or not.\nWhen each time a round happens the monster gets one new ability. That is from the story they found or lore that they heard. \nPractically this is a make your own enemy horror game.\nThe players can fight. Some characters would be weak ones, under dogs, the first to die.\nAlso the enemy watches the whole time so they get to watch and see where they are or what the players do or say. They could kill them the fashion way. Who dies first time stuff. Keep the Virgin alive or dead. If alive then you both get the. SEQUEL! Kinda like a finisher. \nI honestly  dont know what to call it or know if it's made."

khzq01,Escape a sinking cruise ship game idea.,"I've had a relatively simple idea **floating** around my mind for awhile. You're on a cruise ship and for whatever reason, it begins to sink. It's a 3d game where you have the entire ship to explore as it goes down. There are many ways to do things. For example, finding a key to open a door, or breaking a bench from the floor and using it to break down the door. There are many dangers. you could drown, sliding furniture or collapsing structures could crush you, the freezing water could give you hypothermia, so even if you make it out of the water, you need to keep warm. You can choose to lower a lifeboat into the water and escape that way, or stay onboard as the ship takes its final fall into the water and find debris to float on waiting for a rescue ship. Each round is about 30 minutes and you get points for doing things, for example. Lowering a lifeboat gets you 10 points, the longer you stay on the flooding ship and the closer to the water you get gives you more points, etc. There could be a global points board. Maybe the game could be multiplayer and you could all fight to survive. I have no plans on making this game and have no experience in the field. Just a fun idea. Let me know if you would play this game if it existed."

khwrau,A twist on the generic action movie hero formula.,"So I was watching Die Hard and I’ve been thinking how every action game and movie is about a hero going up against this super elaborate plan or something and against all odds makes it out on top. Well I had an idea for a game that I think would be rather interesting and something I’ve never seen before.\n\nThe game would be about being a villain in an action movie and having to go up against a protagonist figure. You would have to devise elaborate plans with a bunch of variables in play to take into account. And then execute it without getting taken out or outsmarted by the protagonist or protagonists.\n\nThe structure would be that there are a bunch of missions in areas for you to take on, the more you level up the more complex the mission variables get. You have a planning phase where you set everything up and place everything down such as guards, traps, diversions, etc. then you execute the plan in a payday 2 style way with a first person perspective. You would of course get money for completing these missions allowing you to get better gear for yourself, better gear for your organization, and better technology for your organization. The design philosophy would be a freedom of approach. All you have at your disposal is what your goal is, what things the protagonist has and the variables at play will have to be figured out vi trial and error. It will be like a strategy game with how these things work and every single trap and thing you put down will have an exploitable weakness and a bit of RNG. Like the guards you get are mostly things to give you time but there is a small chance that they may kill the protagonist. \n\nThis is probably a tad bit ambitious for like an indie dev or something but if they can figure out a way to simplify this idea then I could definitely see something interesting being made.\n\nThanks for listening."

You get to use a scale for how long the hair is, for how stiff/silky the hair is, and how the hair is done (natural, dreadlocks, ponytails, curls, etc.).\n\nMost games just have you pick hairstyles and that's it. Want a mohawk with ponytails... somehow? Nope, just get what they give you"
khrulo,An RPG that sticks to the base and does it really well,"Nowadays, every RPG needs to come with a twist or something, so what if we stick to the basics and just nail them. My concept is a game set in a fantasy world, where you can customise your characters appearance and choose a race that has their own unique attributes, and different appearance options, however if you want to be an elf yet keep a human appearance, that is an option, here are the races.\n\nHuman - well balanced with a starting base resistance in all effects, Base stats are 2 in all. Treated fairly  \n\n\nElf - high starting magic dps, low starting physical damage, low starting physical defence, high magic defence. Treated fairly by humans, low by orcs and hated by dark elves. Can walk through magical barriers without requiring a spell.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDark Elf - similar to elf with a potency for learning dark, fire, and ancient magic. Dark appearance with parts of body being covered with red runes and glyphs. Thought down on by humans, thought down on by elves, admired by orcs and scorned by nymphs. Weak to water, life and wind magic. Can walk through flames, lava and such, is healed by lava.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWood Nymph - similar to elf with a high affinity for learning earth, life, healing and ancient magic. Woodlike appearanc with parts of body being covered in leaves, bark and such. Immune to life magic, weak to fire, dark magic. Can hide in a trees trunk to escape enemies.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOrcs - have high physical damage and defence, excellent with crafting. Immune to poisons. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWater nymph - similar To elf, with unlimited breath time in water, complete immunity to water magic, and high forte in water, life and ancient magic. Water dash and general speed upgrade in water\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWind nymph - similar to elf, with the ability to glide in air and takes no fall damage. High affinity for wind, lightning,  and ancient magic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nstats are\n\nPlain leveling up gives a major boost in all of these, refills health and mana, gives a stat point and a skill point that can be used for non magic skills, and a magic point for either upgrading spells up to lvl 5 or purchasing a spell, can also get skills from quests and can get spells, and magic points from quests.\n\nStrength - pretty obvious, increases carry capacity, melee damage.\n\nDefence - again pretty obvious\n\nPrecision - pretty straightforward, increases crit chance, accuracy with aiming and wider window for dodging.\n\nWisdom - increases mana capacity, magic learning speed, cast speed, magic damage and such.\n\nStealth - obvious\n\nAgility - increases speed, dodging speed but not to the point that it looks really stupid.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis would be a high fidelity game with amazing effects and graphics, almost no bugs, great customisation, that is surprisingly hard to find in most games, in this one you won’t have to spend hours trying to find a way to not make your character look stupid. Hyper realistic, and suited for both 3rd and first person. 2nd part coming soon"
khqiul,"A Social Based RPG: where combat is based on social interactions, politicking, and subterfuge instead of actual fighting.","Not sure how it would be done. The key thing is that it would need to differentiate itself from Adventure Games, Point + Click Adventure games, and Visual Novels. \n\nHave NPCs with Social Hit Points that can be knocked down as you get in their good graces. Or have NPCs Social Hit points go up when you move against them.\n\n* Possible Settings:\n   * Medieval Royal Court\n   *  Jane Austen like setting.\n   * Urban Fantasy Vampire politics.\n   * Space Opera/Star Trek\n   * Murder Mystery\n\nLike I'm not saying get rid of combat, but try to expand RPG mechanics further than what we've currently seen."
khq0oy,American Psycho ideas?,"I always think about some movies that could make a good game. Sometimes it’s really challenging. I can’t really wrap my head around how a game with Patrick Bateman would work and what would you do as the player?\n\nI thought about having it a horror, but why?\nAre you playing Patrick?

khdlo1,Ballet Social Sim,It's a singleplayer rhythm social sim where you attend a high school and learn and practice ballet. In-between that you'll socialize with other ballet dancers or other students attending the school.\n\nI'm not entirely sure how these relationships can benefit your performance but one idea is that you'll have anxiety and you can reduce that with your relationships. And if you don't reduce your anxiety enough you'll chicken out.\n\nI'd like the art style to be like Van Gogh's or something similar and the animation would be dream-like. The music would be ballet and maybe other forms of classical.

kol5xp,Mechanic idea :item history,(I've looked every where for a mechanic like this but I can't find it so here)\nMy idea for a mechanic is in a mmo gamewhere every item in the game has history and im not talking about dev lore but player history if you find a spell book in a dungeon then you are put into that items \nHistory and when you trade that item then a other player is also put into that items history and so on and so forth  then there is a button in the game that to that items history page showing you every player that has gotten that item and how they got for example: looting \nTrading creating that item etc \nI would love this to be in a game
kohr4p,Strategic management rpg,"An rpg where your stats are depleted every time you use them (attacking lowers attack, dodging lowers max stamina ecc), and to increase them you have to defeat enemies, while different enemies gives bonus to different stats. You would have to carefully manage you actions and energies, and assuming grinding is well discouraged it would lead to interesting gameplay. One way to do so, for example, would be to make enemies that give consistent bonus to attack be extremely powerful in their att strength and thus forcing the player to use more of the other stats, may that be defense or dodging.\nWould it be fun to play or it would get frustrating or worse boring too easily?"
koemzk,A Mech game I wish I could make.,"If I had the ability and time I would make a pixel art based online mech game. \n\nThink if Escape from Tarkov, Warframe and Brigador had a baby on a much smaller scale with simple graphics. Top down iso like Tiberian Sum or third person like Risk of Rain 2. \n\nEssentially:\n\nI want more [Brigador](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qmmnHoBAlk), but I want to create my own mech; build it from scratch myself; take it into a generated map; to complete a time limited contract I selected; with 3 other players I was lobbied with; with the threat of fighting against a team of four enemies. I then want to extract from the map with the loot of my fallen enemies, if I died in that match then I lose everything. \n\nI want the game to be slow and high stakes, it should take at least 20 minutes to complete a mission. \n\nI want a game where I can log into my own place (like [Warframe's personal ship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CebSWhhdiS0), or in this case your personal [Mech garage](https://res.cloudinary.com/lmn/image/upload/fl_lossy,q_80/f_auto/v1/gameskinny/f11c70ec5816650ec1debb374f55c3a1.jpg)). Trade the loot I don't want for money to buy the parts I do want directly from other players doing the same. \n\nIf you are a gifted and talented intermediate dev you could use this space to make mech creator engine similar to [spore's alien creator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzszX3H9czg). This is very ambitious and only a bonus but I'd imagine it to be a massive selling point. \n\nI don't need a story as much as a contextual backdrop, e.g. like [Warframe's syndicate](https://i.redd.it/yxnaxgaoc8n21.jpg) system with corps employing you for contracts that fit their narrative (a bioresearch company wants you to kill a behemoth alien/ a rebel org wants you to sabotage military points). \n\nSimilar to Escape from Tarkov you need to be picky and decide how to gear your mech, open desert space or close urban combat? Assasination mission or hold a point against waves of enemies? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStyle: \n\nStellar Jockeys nailed it but [pixel art in a 3d space from a third person perspective](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjuybbn2beU) is very compelling. Although again, very ambitious. \n\nIt's a game a single dev couldn't make I know but this is my message in a bottle."

kob3q3,Driving simulator where you actually have to follow traffic rules. And then it gets weird.,"The most intuitive way to track player's performance would be using a score system, but I wouldn't make it too obvious making bad performances being followed by angry comments by other drivers and chasing cops or something.\nBut then, imagine the game being set in a city where every morning the mayor changes some traffic rules, and you have to read and remember today's rule to be a good driver. Absolutely absurd laws like today is legal to hit other cars and run over pedestrian but not turning right.\nIt would soon make interesting and hilarious gameplay."
ko7sei,Cyberpunk game idea,"I'm at the point of finishing 3D environments and character models for my own game that I'm looking to finish by the end of 2021.\n\nThe basic premise is a ""buddy"" cop game where you play a newbie cop and you're partnered with an experienced android female partner. Its an action/story driven game where you'd be able to switch characters at any time during combat or when solving puzzle elements.\n\nI was initially going to make it a linear first person game with each level having its own special mechanic...which will require more work but will be far more immersive and I'll need to nail the visuals but the whole game would be quite short.\n\nOr an isometric game (like Hades) and I could make it more open ended however it would be completely story driven with some RPG elements and would be far easier to make a 2D and I'd also be able to take some shortcuts, but I also feel this approach would be less immersive...\n\nAny ideas/suggestions would be appreciated."
ko7b1a,Out of ideas,I've gotten to a point where I'm out of ideas for games so I was wondering if anyone has any ideas.\n\nI'm more comfortable with 2d games but I can make 3d ones too.\n\nIf anyone has an idea I would be glad to hear it.

ko4qoi,A game kinda like escape from tarkov or hunt showdown set in a nuclear wasteland I came up with when I was high,"Set in Soviet Union(1972) after nuclear accident(1959). You have to do quests for the settlement residents e.g. scavenge supplies from certain locations(lowest risk, low reward) or defeat powerful mutated monster animals which killed people from the settlement or something (very high risk, high reward it's a bounty pretty much) you'd cut its head off to show it to the ""authorities"" of the area, kinda like government but over lawless nuclear wasteland (they pay the big bounty). There will be other players to contend with in both scenarios but there won't be much incentive to kill them in the scavenging missions as no one would take good loot in as it's low reward low risk. And you would get worse deals or deals will become unavailable for weapons and supplies from the authorities (explain below). \n\nPlayers would use mostly handmade weapons made from pipes, wood, tape etc that they can easily make. These would be appropriate for just self defense against the players in scavenging missions. However when you get into bounty hunting mutants you will start needing more firepower. The authorities that you will start dealing with as you begin your hunting career will have legitimate weaponry for sale like Aks and SKS and all kinds of other stuff from the period.you will start being able to afford these after your first one or two successful bounties."

ko1sgy,1v4 ghostbuster/exorcist type game,"One person plays as a ghost trying to scare all the NPCs and players to death, or just into fleeing the location.\nThe other four players play as a team and must hunt down and exorcise the ghost player before the ghost completes their goal.\n\nThere are different types of ghosts you can play as. Each has their own strengths and weaknesses. One might be better at making noise, one could be better at throwing objects, and another could be better at possession.\nThe other four players are going to have to deduce what type of ghost you are in order to figure out how to exorcise you, so you might want to keep a low profile at first.\nThe ghost can scare NPCs and human players to lower their sanity. When their sanity gets too low, they either flee the area or kill themself. (If you wanted to keep this PG, their heads could just pop like a balloon when they get too scared, or something.) The more NPCs and players you drive away, the lower the atmosphere gets and the easier it is to scare people. The longer the game goes on and the lower the atmosphere, the stronger your powers.\n\nThe human players also have their own classes. Each class has their own strengths and set of items on them. One could be a psychic who is easier to possess and can tell when the ghost is within a certain radius of them. One could be a priest/nun that is harder to possess but has a limited ability at exorcising the ghost. Another could be a hellsing type character that has a lot of equipment on him.\nHumans have to decipher what kind of ghost the other player is by what powers and effects they see the ghost use. They can’t see the ghost unless the ghost uses certain abilities. They must try to blend in with the tourists in the area in order to avoid being targeted by the ghost.\n\nYou can also equip different perks and items to your ghost and human characters to give them a boost."

knyf2t,Indie mashup fighting game idea,"By the way, I have been looking for a place to post all of my game ideas for a very long time and I was extremely surprised to find this sub here. Anyway, I have tons of game ideas. It's basically my hobby to imagine video games and draw their cover art, characters, and more. Some I even get so into that I pretend to release new updates for them every so often (lol). I'll draw a page titled, for example, *UPDATE 1.5*, and then I'll write all the new features coming in the update, and at the bottom, when the update will be released.\n\nSo as you can imagine, I have notebooks full of ideas and drawings. The one I am most into right now is called *Otherworld Arena*. It's a crossover fighting game (that isn't Super Smash Bros.). It mostly only has characters from indie games, but they have to be popular enough to be at least recognizable by the majority. The game updates regularly, adding new characters. In OWA they are called *heroes*.\n\n*Otherworld Arena*'s original five heroes were:\n\nHenry Stickmin (Henry Stickmin)\n\nCuphead (Cuphead)\n\nFrisk (Undertale)\n\nImpostor (Among Us)\n\nThe Knight (Hollow Knight)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUpdate 1.4 added Crash Bandicoot (may I remind you this game and its updates are fictional)\n\nAnd Update 1.5 (which is coming on January 10th) will be adding Qbby, from the BOXBOY franchise"
knxv7f,A good war story,"Like I'm thinking of a good one, not the Americans, not the Anglish. The Russians. A story about a scared 19 year old who gets pushed trough the traumas of war, it should represent what war really is like. While using real places and battalions. While still NOT acting like a movie, this is not a special idea but a hard request but I'm sure someone can do it. P.S this is my first post so yea."

knv7pg,Using your own corpse from previous runs as source of material.,"Please excuse any grammar error, I'm not English native. \n\nI was thinking of some top-down or isometric real-time rpg, heavily inspired by Hyper Light Drifter in style and basic combat mechanics, where every time you respawn centuries passes and your old corpse crystallizes, morphing your stats into solid elements used to forge new items. To avoid repetitive gameplay I thought to add rogue-like elements in a fixed world, for example some routes closing and others opening each run. I'm still thinking if it'd be better to implement checkpoints or pure rogue tabula rasa character. \n\nThe idea started from the concept of an elemental world, where the four elements have the corresponding body-part and statistic (fire = arms = strength, earth = legs = movement/defense, air = chest = hp/stamina, water = head = magic/willpower). You would increase your statistics defeating specific enemies, but you cannot upgrade your weapons or abilities without the crystals. You would craft abilities and items from a 2x2 grid, using maybe various degrees of crystallization of the same 4 elements. I don't mean your dead body to be the only source of crystals (maybe you can find others adventurer's bodies along the way) but it'd be the main.\n\nI imagined the world a little brighter that HLD's and with less neon, with a wider set of environments.\n\nAnother feature I'm thinking about is having to build yourself every stat visualizer, otherwise you don't know how much health or magic power you have left. Maybe it would be a bit weird and very hard to adapt for new players while the experienced wouldn't need the indicators, but I like the idea of not having your stats displayed if you don't build something to read them. I'd surely add visual indicators on the character body (colored aura or brightness) if I removed the HUD."
knu97t,A puzzle platformer with a twist,"This game will be a game where play as 2 characters, the architect and the platformer. the architect is able to move physics based objects through a 3d space, the platformer can only move in the second dimension and can only interact with objects as they appear in the second dimension (Ex: you put a sphere down and the platformer sees it as a circle but as you move it through the Z axis they see it get smaller and start floating until you move it so far out it disappears. this game could work with single player or 2 player co-op"
kntmnb,Rotten World - Small Open World Competitive VR Zombie Survival Game,"Important: This game idea has some inconsistencies and is uncompleted but I thought I'd throw it up here incase it gave anyone a interesting read or an idea for their own game. In saying this by all means rip this idea to shreds if you think its bad.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\*\*The Game consists of these main factors:\*\* (gameplay loop)\n\nSpawn - Scavenge - Craft - Run/Fight - Ascend - survive/fight - Extract - Sell items - Restart.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis game has 3 main levels, they are expressed in more detail down below but essentially they are - sewers, ground level, skyscrapers. The objective of the game is to get to the top floor with the most gear and loot as possible and extracting whilst staying a live. Players start at floor 2 and can descend into the sewers if the want (high risk high reward) but ultimately the idea is to out run the elements, people and Ai with all your loot and extract at the top.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\[zombies/Becoming Infected\]\n\nThe game contains 3 different types of zombies:\n\nScratchers - These Zombies rely heavily on the darkness to move around once a light source is presented in front of them the scurry away. Scratchers are only located in level 1 due to their hatred for light and make incredibly loud scratching \n\nnoises a long the hallway's so that the player knows when to turn on and off light sources to stay safe. these zombies can be taken down but its incredibly inefficient and attracts more attention than it merits, meaning that its better to use the light  more often.\n\nWalkers - casual zombies that are seen in apartment rooms  on level 3 and in stores and outside on level 2. These zombies can be taken out with a blow to the head with a melee or a gun, various explosive items or fire\n\nthey can also take fall damage from being shoved of a building. \n\nJumpers - These zombies have the ability to jump from building to building and cannot be outrun. They are a lot rarer than the usual walker and can be found on level 3 only.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\[Changing attributes in the city server\]\n\nThe the match continues a massive Flood causes players to ascend to higher levels starting from level 1 (the sewers) to level 2.5 (ground floor, carparks and convenience stores, gun shops)\n\nOnce the flood is done at level 2.5 The zombie virus mutates from being bites to becoming air Bourne. This causes the player to scavenge higher up as resources are limited and gasmask filters dont last long \n\nforcing them to go to level 3 (up skyscrapers/final level) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\[World, Deadhorse City\]\n\nSewers (Level 1)\n\n Mostly taken over by scratcher zombies, the sewers are directionless in nature but allow for a more secret way to transport around the city if you can navigate through the darkness, \n\ncontaining secret areas with high quality items and skill books, its main draw back is its the first level to completely flood, and with only so many exits you might get trapped down in the darkness, ending your game early.\n\nThis area is filled with small exits, sewer holes, locked rooms and destroyed hallways.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGround level (Level 2)\n\nTrain - a train governed by the army that comes and stops with high quality supplies, skill Books and vehicles like a Humvee with a turret on the back. \n\nThough storming the train comes with a high chance of dying (it takes a lot of man and firepower to take stuff from the train but its game changing stuff)\n\nCarparks - areas which contain small vehicles that allow for quick transportation around on ground level. drawbacks to these vehicles come with extreme sound and little armour, attracting players and zombies alike.\n\nGun shops - These stores are pretty self explanatory, containing weapons skill papers and an arsenal of very needed low and high end ammo\n\nConvenience stores - these contain common items like food, water craftable items and low end ammo\n\nBoats - Incredibly rare vehicles that allow players to not use carparks or skyscrapers to get to 2.5, mean they have less chance of encountering enemies, though armoured, they make an extreme  amount of noise \n\nmeaning that leaving them once your inside one an be an extreme challenge. These spawn at Docs which have a higher amount of zombies at them due to people trying to leave during the initial outbreak. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSkyscrapers (Level 3)\n\nThis is essentially supposed to be the final level where players extract from with their loot and items\n\nat this level there is a bunch of tall buildings connected with various broken down wooden walkway bridges which connect them all, at this point your either: gunning for the exit to save your loot, dying to the gas cause your gas mask has broke or fighting other players that managed to rise to the other levels.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\[Camp sites\]\n\nCamp sites are the players Home base, they can be set up at any location on the map, wether that be outside on a hill or inside a room in a apartment they allow the player to collect their thoughts, strategies \n\nand use the various workstations bellow to get ahead in the game and become stronger. These are set up by the player with the starting items they hold in their backpack. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(Filtration systems/Cooking) - water and food - Food and water are needed to increase stamina and can even prolong an infected players death making them very important to produce \n\nthe system is essentially a cooking station that allows you to boil water and cook various foods. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(Weapons and items Crafting bench)\n\nThis crafting bench is where you are able to craft various items such as Molotov's, spike bombs, alarm traps and torches to use in battle with Ai and players. \n\nas well as increasing damage buffs and makeshift silencers for your weapons  \n\nIn order to craft these you must have come across the special items u need to make them. \n\ne.g if you want to create a Molotov you need to find motor oil, cloth, a bottle of alcohol and use these items at the bench to create the Molotov \n\nyou then need to either have a match or zipper to use it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is where the skill books come in handy. The skill books and papers contain crafting recipes for all the variations of items you can craft in the game. Telling you how to put together an item and \n\nif you have the materials needed to do so. \n\nThe workshop contains a foldable table with a top light. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(Games/Music) - Chess or little psp games that you can find which allow you to pass time whilst things are crafting, As well as a music play to use if you dare allow yourself to be off guard.\n\n(Radios) allow for players to talk to other player camps with radios, this can lead to trade locations using certain safes around the map, team ups or to spread false information.\n\nRadio briefcases can be found throughout the map on all levels.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\[Weapons building and savaging\]\n\nDeterioration of weapons cause them to loose their sharpness and steadiness after becoming to used\n\nmaking the player go back to Homebase to recraft them using the materials they've created/found\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\[Ai system\]\n\nMerchants - the surviving civilians that reside in places like a boxed off stadium which allow you to trade with them to get items \n\nArmy - Drop supplies to random locations using helicopters that can be shot down.\n\nDoctors - hold certain medical items that can cure patients in late game if their mask broke.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope you like a few notes for an idea i came up with out of the blue, by all means good and bad, tell me what you think. :0"
knt0rt,Stealth Game in a Fantasy World,"I love coming up with ideas that break a stereotype. For example, I’d love to see a stealth game but set in a fantasy world instead of a modern setting, so no guns, just medieval weapons and some spell casting. I was considering two models:\n\nModel 1: Instant death if you’re spotted\n\nModel 2: Once you’re spotted you have to kill everyone, but if you’re not spotted you don’t have to have any fatalities, and getting zero fatalities earns you extra gold you can spend to learn new spells, get new skins, or improve stats."
knsbbu,"Ricochet game, FPS with emphasis on environment analysis, forward thinking and cutting off opponents escape route","I thought it’d be cool if bullets were coated in an elastic material so that the only way you could hit people is with the ricochet e.g. if it hits something the elastic shell is shredded and it bounces off of it but now it actually hits people and you could have a wide range of weapons, each with a different number of bounces until the elastic shreds, this could result in battle royals where you’re trying to corner your opponent by cutting off their escape routes with bullets, leading them into a dead end, planning out where the enemy will be and where you need to shoot so it will be there after the number of bounces that weapons bullet has and taking into account how fast it travels, similar calculations when figuring out how to dodge and maybe bullets can have collision with each other so a friend could shoot between two enemies and you could shoot slightly later after they split up to dodge the bullet with a gun that has faster bullets so your bullet catches up to your friends bullet and they bounce off each other which shreds the elastic material of both and the now deadly bullets strike one enemy each, one bouncing off to the left and the other to the right. Kinda like how the beast men’s game is in No Game No Life? Could utilise these bullets collisions to shoot taking into account variables previously mentioned to get a bullet to strike another bullet before it hits you to protect yourself, hit someone hidden behind something from above, reflect bullet back at enemy, protect ally from bullet, etc.\n\nI think the number of bounces should be indicated with colour e.g. yellow is 3 bounces left, blue, red, then it’s harmful and becomes black and will damage on impact and be destroyed. Weapons colour can reflect number of bounces it’s bullets have.\n\nEssentially I’d like to experience the strategy of using the environment to put opponents in inescapable situations with planning and careful baiting and execution, I played a game as a kid like this game (https://store.steampowered.com/app/1302550/Tanklike/) or the tank game from clubhouse games 51 worldwide classics on the switch and have always wanted to see that sort of gameplay but with human characters that can move with greater versatility with more ricochet, bullet collisions, 3D and with characters with greater mobility."

knndum,an openworld avatar game,"Basic as it sounds,a game about exploring all four nation, with the power of all 4 elements.\n\nlike using the staff to fly, create pillars with earth, shoot fire for long range, or surf with water, and bunch of other ways to either move around or beat up people with the power of all 4 elements.\n\nclosest game i had in mine to understand how it be, is spiderman ps4, except replace the webslinging."
knjdjc,Hand Tracking Finger Gun Game,"Use your hands to make gun shapes and your mouth to make the noises. You could have duel pistols, lazers, shotguns, machine guns or rocket launchers depending on how you use your hands and voice.\n\nYou'd see your hands in game but things like muzzle flash, projectiles and impacts would be visually added.\n\nI think it would be most fun using Oculus' hand tracking though it would still be very playable using regular VR controllers. There could be gestures or voice commands for specials like timeouts, slow motion and forcefields which could be either found in the level or based on cooldowns."
knitqb,Top-down team stealth game,"Hi all!\nI’ve been toying with the idea of a 2d/top-down team vs team stealth game and want to hear your thoughts.\n\nPremise: A team of Agents must infiltrate [some place] and complete an objective, while the Guards must detect and eliminate them.\n\nStyle: Simple, inviting 2D artwork. Refer to Among Us\n\nGame flow: Round-based gameplay - teams switch after each round, and after some time the map is changed (refer to counter-strike, etc)\n\nMechanics:\nLighting - Dynamic lighting. Agents can’t be seen while in darkness, but guards have directional flashlights.\nSound - Most actions taken produce sound. Since this is 2D top-down, sound could be represented by ‘pings’ on the edges of opponents’ screens to indicate direction and strength of sounds in range. Agents must progress slowly or risk exposing themselves.\nWeapons - Since this game is more about stealth than gunplay, elimination is always via one-hit kills. Guards have handguns while Agents may only use knives. (These could be switched out for more family-friendly ideas)\nEnvironmental tools - vent systems and lighting control panels for the Agents, camera systems for the Guards, etc etc\nUnknown objectives - to prevent Guards from simply camping an objective, only the Agents know what they must accomplish in a round, and this is random each time.\n\n\nPossible additions:\nNPCs - characters going about their own business in the mission location. They must not be harmed, and can be used by the agents to blend in and hide in plain sight.\nPoint system - rather than a simple win/lose condition, points could be awarded based on time taken and team members lost, etc.\n\nLet me know if this sounds interesting, you see potential problems, or have any other ideas! Thanks in advance!"
knhuvy,An open world combat game where direct hits are prohibited,"I’m thinking of a game something like the Hunger Games movies, where you and a bunch of other players/cpus compete to be the last one standing, armed to the teeth with all sorts of weapons. The only catch is that you can’t use the weapons directly, but you rather have to use them to manipulate your environment. E.G. using an axe to chop down a tree and letting it fall on someone. (or a much better idea). I think an intelligent brawler would be fun."

knfv64,"A farming simulator where cute monster girls help you, but it’s sfw, none of this hentai crap.","If you’ve ever played a game like stardew valley then you know what kind of graphics I personally would think would look good.\n\nA few days ago I was looking for an sfw monster girl game and couldn’t find one (unsurprisingly) but it’s something I want. Because I think harpies are cute and I want them helping me grow beets and whatever else on my farm. \n\nSpecific requests would be making it have some kind of story, some kind of procedurally generated challenge dungeon, that would be unlocked post story. Each character can be hired and used for something specific, as well as being able to pick one at the beginning of the game to start off with, like for example an auto selling monster girl, one that can clear a spot for farms, or one that could be a remote market link. But if anyone wants to take up this request please do it, I’ve been wanting something like this for ages after finding out almost no sfw monster girl related games exist, I want to have a nice farming simulator with them in it.\n(for full monster girl references check out the monster girl encyclopedia wiki, just mind the hentai bits)"
knd6yh,What's your thoughts on a proper space game?,"Hello There!\n\nSo, I've been playing some space games recently and almost every single one of them, when comes to outer space combat or movement, there is loud sound and gunfire like on earth. \n\nNow, I get it, games need to games and have some kind of eye-candy, but for example, something like Dead Space, when you are inside there is sounds everywhere, but when you are outside, there almost none.\n\nDo you guys think that if more games implemented that, they would become too boring?\n\nTL;DR: Space game with proper space mechanics?"

knar26,Terraria Like Game where you Fight Bosses and Explore,"I've posted about my Game Idea often on r/gamedesign and I'd like to see how what you guys think. I'm planning on making the game in Unity. Redigit recommended that for Game Developers. \n\nTo Explain it quickly, it's Terraria but with no building and more strict classes. \nYou would choose your class Warrior, Ranger, Summoner, or Mage during character creation. You would explore the Nexus Reality of World Two which is a lot of Dimensions fused Together. \nThere's a lot of Lore I came up with, but to put is simply, A Girl and Her Boyfriend travel to the Dimension to create Life. She comes with her pet Slime who is the Alkahest but she doesn't realize that yet. The Slime Guy becomes a Recurring Boss. There are giant Interdimensional Creatures called Absorbers. There's also a Civilizations in the Ocean of Weresharks, Wereoctopuses/Werepi and Fish People. \nYou'd collect Resources and created Armor and Weapons to fight Bosses. After Defeating a Boss, you'll get a new piece of gear makes you more powerful, be it a Weapon, Accessory or Transformation. There would also be Underwater Bosses and you'd be able to Transform into one of the Mentioned Fish Shark and Octopus people along with a Whale Transformation. There would be a Large Dungeon like Area called the Labyrinth where a Dimensional Beast is kept. He's an important boss. The Caves in the game were dug by a Worm (another boss) and that's why they're so wide and you don't need to mine to get anywhere."

kn8utg,Star Wars Survival,So as a survival game fan and a starwars fan I think the idea would be pretty cool. I mean executed well enough that is. After having over 1.5k hours on dayz and arma 2 I was thinking maybe it wouldn't be so hard to make a starwars themed version of a survival sim. Maybe based on one planet to start of with then later on develop it into a more expensive game. What do you guys think. Bad or good idea?
kn5026,0 Gravity FPS,"A zero gravity fps balanced around movement skill instead of shooting. I envision it as follows\n\nPlayers would choose between 3 different options for movement\n\n1. Jetpack/ EVA pack that allows them to move in any direction, with the downside of giving off a visible rocket exhaust and having limited fuel. In my opinion this would have the lowest skill gap low risk/low reward but very stable and I see it as a good option for a sniper\n2. Grappling hook letting player pull themselves toward objects and swing around them (Kinda like spiderman but in space) The downside being a limited line length and having the line be venerable to break if damaged. This one has the potential to be very effective if used by a skilled player high risk/high reward\n3. A pair of magnetic/gravity boots that let the player walk/run on any surface and jump from that surface, they would also allow the player to control where gravity is pulling them. This option seems to me as a good middle ground of risk/reward for intermediate players\n\nThese 3 would need to be balanced properly to make sure they play fairly. \n\nOther important mechanics:\n\n1. Realistic Physics, as in guns recoil affects your velocity and of course different guns have varying amounts of recoil. Also your characters loadout weight affects your movement speed and inertia. \n2. Different armor setups that cover varying areas of the body and protect from certain  types of weapons more effectively than others and of course have differing mass added on to the player.\n3. No sound  from other players unless you are both grappled/walking on the same object or hit by a projectile\n4. A few choices of guns maybe 10 max to keep it easy to balance, choose whatever aesthetic you like but I'd stick to 4 categories. Firearms would be able to penetrate armor most effective but at the downside of physical recoil, laser weapons that kill through transferring heat to the target aka a slower time to kill but with the benefit of no recoil and infinite ammo, melee weapons are pretty obvious, and explosive weapons like rocket and grenade launchers which if you're hit by push you away from the center of the explosion force depending on how close you are to the blast and size of the charge.\n5. 100m cubed Simple maps with 2 or 3 intersecting routes at varying angles to each other, i thought about the engine room of a massive spaceship, an asteroid field, or a space station\n\n I think the game could benefit from stunning visuals of the cosmos and raytraced lighting and all that but that's unimportant to the core mechanics, I'd probably still play the shit out of it (excuse my French) even if the character models were spheres with glocks still would awesome to see the physics in action and how players would use them to their advantage.\n\nI'm 100% open to criticism and suggestions Lemme hear whatcha think."
kn2ddv,Co-op horror mechanic?,I've been wanting to create a VR Co-op horror game. I've had a few ideas but they just aren't scary. Could someone maybe nudge me in the right direction?
kn1xc3,"""Battle Royale"" Weird Idea","A nuke is about to explode in the middle of the town 60-100 (This could change) people are dropped in the map. The players will have 1 hour to do find resources and weapons, there will be proximity chat where you can recruit allies that can help you with objectives or kill them for their loot, the final objective would be to find the key to a bunker to survive the nuke (the key would have an specific bunker number that you can open that only the person that found it could see). I was thinking the game would be DayZ like experience where the game doesn't really tell you what or how to do stuff, you just know the nuke is gonna go off and you have to move and find stuff. If you manage to survive you can keep everything you looted and when you come back and play again you'd appear with the loot, in this case instead of playing the same objective again you could try for a bigger objective which would be to defuse the nuke, if you get killed tho you'd lose everything. (Idea in progress, I'm not really a game developer or anything, also I speak Spanish mainly so pardon my English xD)"

kmvoej,Ideas for multiplayer fps game,Im making a test game in UE4 multiplayer fps. Basicly a CSGO ripoff. I dont wanna add powers but any ideas to make it more intresting when playing with friends?
kmrxw3,SW:BF 2 but slower and more tactic based,The Battlefront games were genuinely fun at heart but I found myself looking for a more Squad-like game with more drawn out battles instead of running and gunning. The use of the modern vehicles and machinery from the Star Wars series flying overhead or stomping through a small village just makes my heart smile.
kmquyk,i want to make a kitchen rush-like game but i need ideas for gimmicks that will set it apart,hey! i've been wanting to make a game similar to overcooked but in a first-person for a bit now but i need ideas to set it apart. i dont want to make a generic rush-to-complete-orders type game so i need gimmicks or concepts that will set it apart
kmpxfb,God of War + Warzone = Naruto?,"So a little backstory before I get into the game itself. Naruto was the last anime I really adored. The series came out when I was about 11 yrs old and ended (at least it seems like) 10 yrs later. Since then I guess I’ve aged out of anime, nothing holds my attention the way it did when I was a kid. \n\nI’ve always had dreams of playing a Naruto like, over the shoulder, open world, pvp multiplayer game. A game that allows you to run freely, has awesome combat, and stealth mechanics that allow to outsmart novice players (hide in bushes, set traps, etc).\n\nWhen the original Ultimate Ninja came out, I got excited thinking “this would be it” and while I loved those games, they never delivered what I was looking for. I know the hardcore fans of that series would argue otherwise, but I never found mashing O to be very deep, or gratifying. Games like For Honor and Absolver have also come close but no stealth, so not quite. \n\nIt wasn’t until I played God of War for the first time, last year, at a friends, that I got a glimpse of what could be. The combat in that game is incredible. It was the first time I played an action game where the combat buttons are on the triggers as opposed to the face buttons. I thought this was amazing. Since, I’ve noticed quite a number of games, in the last few years, have also gone this route. I bought AC Origins + Odyssey, and those games had similar mechanics to GoW, plus great stealth mechanics!\n\nThis March, Warzone debuted, I was in the midst of quarantine, and thought “fuck it, why not?”, and decided to download it. It was the first battle royale I ever played (I played one match of Fortnite, didn’t get and gave up). After my initial frustrations, once I learned the mechanics, I loved it. Gameplay wise, I think it’s the most respectable addition to the series, since the perk system (maybe zombies?). The tension that builds as the circle shrinks, really ramps up the moment to moment gameplay in such a satisfying way. \n\nAnd this was when it all clicked. What if a game combined the strengths of both games into one awesome, hand to hand combat battle royale. Like all battle royale’s a large number of players would be dropped onto a large map, with a gradually shrinking play area. The goal of course would be to loot in search of preferred weapons and cash. I like the buy station mechanic in Warzone, so that’d be included. Instead of shooting, players would engage in hand to hand combat (I guess the time to kill shouldn’t be too high, to mitigate third partying). Players would also be able to shoot bow and arrows and use additional equipment (bombs, stuns, traps, etc.) by pulling the left trigger. Stealth would be a major factor. Players could hide in bushes and climb trees like the AC series.\n\nI know Darwin’s Project dabbled with a similar idea, but that game was too cartoonish for my liking. I prefer more grounded, less over the top games. \n\nWhat do you guys think?"
kmoi3o,"Legends Rising (I would love to hear ideas to this, and questions too, so hit me if you have any of ither)","(sorry for reposting...just cut out the deeper explanations, feel free to ask)  \n\n\n**Base:** RTS style, base building with a twist: The characters, bildings, heroes, ideas, alliences and such, are all designed by the player who wants to play them.

Use the tools akin to what an easy use game creation engine would have, to allow the players to create their units, buildings, heroes, their abilities, be it whatever their hearts desire, set to a universal resources and currencies that can be found in a fully destructable (and yes, limited size, and fully depletable) world, that the players inhabit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe game itself would play out at first like any Civilization or Command and Concour game, meaning resource collection, upgrading, and remaking....and most importantly, evolution.

kmodaf,Red War Redemption,"Literally like Red Dead Redemption 2.\n\nMaybe a saga (like all the battlefields) and each game is set during the most famous wars in history (so one is ww1, one ww2, one American war of  independence , and so on..)"
kmlz9l,An open world /sandbox Warhammer 40K game based on Titanfall mechanics and the Defense of Ryza,"(Long read warning) I’ve had this idea for about a year or two now. A Warhammer game centered around the defense of Ryza using titanfall mechanics. I’d love to see if this could become an actual game. If this interests you, please feel free to reach out to me so we could talk through any possible problems or add ideas. \n\nYou would take the role of the Titan princep for either The Loyalist forces of the Imperium/Mechanicum or with Warmaster Horus and navigate the world, assisting in smaller scale battles between other titans or ground forces. You are able to choose freely to do as you wish so long as you complete a set of objectives that advance the battle and the story. This would not be turn based and could be set for either first or third person view. \n\nYour Titan arsenal could be changed at the start of each level based on what class your titan is (warhound, reaver, warlord, and warmonger to name a few) and it would fall on you to choose the best load out to deal with other titans, ground forces or siege weapons. Each class of titan would also fulfill a different mission depending on how that titan is best used. So choosing a warmonger titan for a scouting mission would be ill advised, although you’d most likely be safe. \n\nEach class of titan would have its own difficulty and you would have to learn how to use each titan as they would not handle, traverse or move in the same manner (bigger isn’t always better). \n\nI still have more to add but this post is already very long. I’d love feedback or advice from others. In all honesty, I’d love to really dedicate time to making my dream a reality but I have no idea on where to start and don’t have the know-how to do this."
kmljtm,"Legends Rising (not fully flashed out idea, some things ay not make sense, please ask and not judge first)","**Base:** RTS style, base building with a twist: The characters, bildings, heroes, ideas, alliences and such, are all designed by the player who wants to play them.

But it would also enable the players who don't realy have a knack for fighting, to still take up the game, making for the most reliably support player, who collects, who advances, who makes and provides, so as to support the border players of any alliance, or even to form neutral alliances with many diffrent factions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, to adress the last thing in my idea: \n\n\*^(1) Admins:\n\nThese people would be the ones who manange the game and oversee the addition or even the usage of any players' evolution, to make sure no one would go too far and ruin the game, by making blaitent and unrestraind changes. \n\nWhat i mean by this, is these people would prevent OP and Experience breaking people from evolving their units to deal a million damage each, with little upkeep cost to them, with these players being allowd to alter already existing, or newly evolved content a player made, but only if thay can reason with the player why thay did it, to give a sense of honesty to them, with being forced out of a game still being a possibility, if the playre dosen't know or care for it.\n\nAnd by Experience breaking i don't mean a player, who disigns all their equipment on stealing from others, as if those pieces are regulated by someone, thay can be fair, and if done well enough, even be counterd by good enough security based buildings and units/NPC's made SPECIFICALY for that job!\n\n\*^(2) Powerlevel:\n\nThis would be an estimate on any given player's active potential in a conflict. Meaning, if someone were to try and take up arms against that person, that score would show off their most effective state's barrier, i.e. the raw power of their resoures and their usage of them. (few stats shown, like Collected resource estimates (not exacts), a unit production, and the number of evolutions the player went throu tords any goal, be it pieceful, harmful or neutral)\n\nThis would allow for deception on some part, as if someone has a low combat score, but high production, some may think to rob them, only to realise, that that person is positioned in an area thay know and have prepared (i.e. home stead advantage) with defences thay can't compete with, ergo thay need to find a way past it, be it social or physical, head on or deceptive, with all the tools and ways someone may stand up against anyone, or try to side with them depend and come from a player themself. \n\nI would love to hear ideas to this, and questions too, so hit  me if you have any of ither."

klzcu6,Soul Zones V1.0 tl;dr warning,"# Overview\n\n## Description\n\nSoul Stories is an instance-based 3D pseudo-MMO Action game with strong RPG elements. It borrows gameplay elements from Kingdom Hearts, Final Fantasy VII Remake, Sonic Adventure 1 and 2, Spark the Electric Jester 2, Phantasy Star Online 2, Super Mario 3D Land and World, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, Incredible Mandy, Monster Hunter, and Genshin Impact.\n\n## Graphic Design\n\nThe graphics tend to be bright, colorful, and stylized with a cell-shaded style. All characters have a design resembling a mix of MegaMan Battle Network’s Net Navis and Viruses, Pokemon, and Stands from Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure.\n\n## Audio Design\n\nMost of the OST features a mix of techno audio and instruments prominent in various other genres such as orchestra, rock, jazz, and country depending on the scenarios associated with it.\n\n## Monetization\n\nThe game will be either purchasable with Triple-A pricing possibly with DLC-priced addons or free with optional premium currency including an optional subscription for a periodic allowance of premium currency.\n\n# Story\n\n## Background Lore\n\nReality is divided into multiple layers with different types of beings inhabiting each. Beings that live in higher layers have greater knowledge and power, but have fates subject to the actions of beings in lower layers similar to how humans live, die, and decompose in accordance to things smaller than they can see. On the highest layer, beings have very few limits to what they can do, but the worlds they live in are created and destroyed in accordance to the thoughts, feelings, and actions of the beings on the lower layers. You are the consciousness of a being that was too powerful to end after your body died, so it was able to sustain itself by transcending to the highest layer and saturate itself into a mass of ethereal energy to create an object called a Soul that is able to interact with the Worlds around it from within a body so as to combat the beings that seek to destroy all worlds.\n\n## Terminology\n\n## Zone\n\nA Zone is a world within the highest layer of reality. There are new ones being created all the time. Different Zones have specific environments and are divided into areas called Acts, along with a number of gimmicks specific to it.\n\n## Acts\n\nActs are essentially the levels of the game that each have their own specific task to complete. From the Player’s hub, they can be accessed to go to. After a sufficient number of Acts are cleared, the player can go to a free-roam area within the Zone that has many different collectables to find, random events that can offer rewards of some sort, and services that can be performed. Most Acts have optional Tasks and branching paths that can be completed for greater rewards, sometimes with greater difficulty. Most Acts have gimmicks with different mechanics specific to the Zone that can aid in traversing it or benefit the player in some other way. Some Acts have periodic Events which can affect most of the mechanics within it. Acts can also possess Hazards which can either Damage the player with different Attributes or with skill can be taken advantage of to damage enemies.\n\nGoal Acts simply involve getting to the end of the Act, often combatting enemies along the way.\n\nDungeon Acts feature many puzzles that must be completed to get to the goal, often with some actions in one area affecting the environment in the other.\n\nHunt Acts involve finding one or more hidden or hard to access things called Objectives within an open area, but usually there are ways to obtain hints for finding and accessing them.\n\nBoss Acts involve facing off with an exceptionally powerful enemy of some sort, which can sometimes only be made vulnerable with gimmicks across the arena.\n\nChallenge Acts are special acts that often come with rules or modifiers that make it harder somehow or require different skills.\n\nLimited Acts are special and only happen in cycles of real-world time. They offer unique rewards and challenges not found in others.\n\n## Morphs\n\nA Morph are beings on the highest layer born from a concept created by the beings on the lower layers. They will spend their existence living according to their instincts to follow a specific purpose or pattern of actions and react in a specific way to certain types of stimuli. Different types of Morphs live in different Zones and may help the player if assisted.\n\n## Hollows\n\nHollows are the main antagonists in the game. They are essentially beings that lack Souls and are driven purely by Willpower and are born from it when it “boils over” as a result of the feelings of beings in the lower layers becoming intensified. They are very hostile to the Zones and any beings they may find. If too many of them are within one Zone at one time, the Zone will be destroyed, so most beings make an effort to destroy them when they find them. They can come in an endless number of forms with more being discovered all the time, each with their own sets of physical and supernatural abilities. The intelligence of a Hollow tends to scale with its power, with stronger ones being able to command and organize weaker ones. There are rumours of Hollows intelligent enough to communicate with Souls that are able to command Hollows across multiple Zones.\n\n## Quirk\n\nQuirk constitutes the substance of the world. All Quirk is made of the same basic subatomic substance, but can exist in countless forms depending on how the substance is structured and can possess one or more of countless properties in the form it takes. How Quirk is structured largely depends on the Zone it comes from.\n\n## Willpower\n\nWillpower is the energy that drives all things in the Zones. It can be applied an endless number of ways and serves as the fuel source for all supernatural phenomena in the Zones.\n\n## Symbols\n\nSymbols are objects made of Quirk that are saturated with Willpower. They are used to create or improve things in the universe by the Souls inhabiting it. Different Zones will play host to different types of Symbols. Symbols can be found by clearing Acts, completing certain Tasks, hidden away at certain points, by defeating Hollows, or by interacting with certain things in certain ways.\n\n## Traces\n\nTraces are essentially smaller pieces of Quirk saturated with Willpower that serve as the currency of the game and are used as a fuel source by most beings. They can be found pretty much anywhere and are required to complete most actions involving creating or upgrading things.\n\n## Egos\n\nAn Ego is a body a Soul may inhabit. An Ego is born from a great deed that was able to affect the lives of countless other beings in dramatic ways. With a Soul animating it, it can produce Willpower to use a gallery of abilities at its disposal called Corpus. Each Ego also has a usable object that it can make appear or disappear at will called a Figment. Figments can be either a handheld tool or weapon, an extension of their body, an animate figure that it can control like a puppet, or some manner of trinket or apparatus that serves as the medium for a supernatural force.\n\n# Gameplay\n\n## Gameplay Overview\n\nUpon first arriving, the player is instructed to choose one of several Egos that offer different starting experiences that can all be obtained at a later point. Players will obtain more Egos after crafting them from Symbols and Traces. All Egos can be upgraded a Level upon using required Symbols and the necessary amount of Traces. An Ego's capabilities scale from their Level.\n\nAll Acts have Checkpoints that can be warped between. It serves as a point where the Player can Regenerate a new Ego in their Party at once their current Ego is Defeated after losing all its HP. If all Egos are Defeated, the Player gets a Game Over and is forced back to their Hub.\n\nPlayers can also join or create Multiplayer Rooms to cooperate with and/or compete against other Players. If an Act requires an Ego with a specific set of abilities or traits, it will suggest them. If the player does not have that Ego in their possession, they can use a Rental Ego for use in that Act.\n\n## Controls\n\n## Dualshock\n\nA: Jump, Aerial\n\nB: Interact, Variable Input\n\nY: Unique\n\nX: Corpus\n\nRB: Guard, Deflect\n\nRT: Attack\n\nLT: Dash, Run\n\nLB: Lock Target, Lock Hold\n\nControl Pad: Select Item/Party Member, Use Item/Switch Party Member\n\nLeft Stick: Movement\n\nLeft Stick Press: Toggle Look Mode\n\nRight Stick: Camera\n\nRight Stick Press: Sneak\n\nStart: Pause Menu, Options, Quit Area, Quit Game\n\nSelect: Menu, Inventory, Info Log\n\n## Keyboard\n\nSpace: Jump, Aerial\n\nF: Corpus\n\nR: Interact, Variable Input.\n\nV: Unique\n\nR: Dash, Run\n\nLMB: Attack\n\nRMB: Guard, Deflect\n\nMMB: Lock Target, Hold Lock\n\nDirectional Inputs: Select Item, Use Item\n\nWASD: Movement\n\n1: Look Mode\n\nMouse: Camera\n\nTab: Sneak\n\nEsc: Pause Menu, Options, Quit Area, Quit Game\n\nTab: Character Menu, Inventory, Info Log\n\n## Combat\n\n## Basics\n\nPlayers have two meters that tell for three vital resources Hit Points (HP) and Will Points (WP) When an Ego takes Damage from an enemy Attack or a Hazard, they lose HP relative to their Resistances and severity of the Damage. When a player’s current Ego runs out of HP they are forced to restart at their last used Save Point or switch to another Ego in the Party.\n\nEvery Ego has a Normal Attack activated by pressing the Attack Input and an Advanced Attack activated by holding the Attack Input which often comes with certain mechanics that can amplify damage in certain ways or under certain conditions. The player can destroy Hollows by Attacking them and reducing their HP to zero. In response to Hollow’s attacks, players can avoid them by Dashing by pressing the Dash input or Jumping by holding it and going in a certain direction. If a player is adept at reading the Hollow’s attacks, they can take advantage of their momentary Recovery periods between attacks to damage them without leaving them a chance to defend.\n\nPlayers can also Defend against Hollows’ attacks by holding the Guard input, which neutralizes all damage on contact but if the number or power of blocked attacks passes a certain threshold, it puts the player into the Staggered state. The Defense constantly regenerates, but once Staggered the player can’t Attack, Defend, use Active Corpus, for multiple frames depending on their Defense Regeneration By pressing the Guard input rather than holding it, they can Deflect an attack instead, which drains an opponent's Defense instead, however this only lasts for a brief moment and can easily lead to damage if the player misreads the Attack. Some Attacks can’t be Guarded against without a shield of some sort, but they can be Deflected. Some Attacks can’t be Guarded or Deflected regardless of the presence of a shield. Most non-cannon fodder Hollows will actively Guard between Attacks and uses of Corpus, so the player must be aggressive so as to put them into the Staggered state. Some Hollows and Egos regenerate their Defense at an accelerated rate, but when any character has low HP they enter a state called Pressed where their Defense regenerates at a greatly diminished rate.\n\nPlayers also have opportunities to do increased damage to foes called Critical Hits. Their first would be to attack their Weak Point (Ex head), their Blind Side (Ex back) and while they are unaware of their presence (asleep), usually facilitated by Sneaking. Each Ego has a Critical Stat which determines how much a Critical Hit multiplies the damage.\n\n## Corpus\n\nThe most effective way of Damaging foes and Defending against attacks would be to use Active Corpus. Even Active Corpus used by Egos with Very Low Active Corpus Damage tend to do slightly more Damage than an attack with a Very High Attack Damage stat. The use of Corpus requires the expenditure of WPs. WPs are counted as sections of the WP Bar, which fills as the player Attacks, Guards powerful Attacks, Deflects at the last moment, and Dashes and Jumps to avoid attacks at the last moment. Different Egos have different lengths of WP bars. Most attacks have some kind of attribute that are either Physical and Energy based and each character has different Resistances to each of them. Physical Attributes are Slash, Pierce, and Crush. Energy Attributes are Pyro, Cryo, EMag, Bio, Chem, Grav, Psi, and Ether.\n\nCorpus can take many different forms such as some manner of specialized Attack technique, some manner of physical projectiles, magic spell-like Force projections, the creation of a Construct, a temporary Buff or positive Effect, self-healing, an Attack that bestows a Status Ailment, Debuff or Negative Effect of some sort, Attacks that do increased Damage once certain conditions are fulfilled, something that affects the whole Act, or something that isn’t always related to combat like an action that assists in traversing the environment.\n\n## Possible Advanced Attacks\n\nA few examples of Advanced Attacks include thrust attacks which can't be blocked or always deflected unless the target is using a form of shield, flailing attacks which can deal damage regardless of how the target attempts to block or deflect them and can sometimes temporarily disable foes' attacks, sweeping attacks which can damage groups of foes, low attacks that can only be avoided through aerial maneuvers such as jumping, ranged or projectile attacks which can harm foes from an extended distance, charge attacks where the character can quickly cover the distance to a foe, rush attacks which start combos that strike quicker in succession than the normal attack, burst attacks which strike multiple times in rapid succession, heavy attacks which do chip damage even if the attack itself is blocked or parried, and grab attacks which can't be blocked or deflected and can even launch foes into hazards or other foes for further damage.\n\n## Items\n\nItems are actively used objects that serve many purposes including healing damage or restoring critical resources. Some items can be stacked but in turn are consumable. Some items have multiple uses but must be recharged between Acts, and some have unlimited uses but are only useful in very specific situations. Different Egos have more or less slots for Items and the player can decide which ones in the party can get them between Acts.\n\n## Artifacts\n\nArtifacts act as the equipment in the game, boosting an Ego’s stats and endowing them with passive effects. Some Egos can equip more at once than others. Some dramatically increase some stats but endow a negative effect of some sort. Some endow very useful passive effects but “break” and disappear under the right conditions.\n\n# Specific Egos\n\nNote: Each Ego can have its color pallets freely swapped by the player and may have optional skins which change its model.\n\n## Morthir\n\n## Profile\n\nA tall Ego resembling a suit of plate armor with a cape.

It borrows gameplay elements from Kingdom Hearts, Final Fantasy VII Remake, Sonic Adventure 1 and 2, Spark the Electric Jester 2, Phantasy Star Online 2, Super Mario 3D Land and World, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, Incredible Mandy, Monster Hunter, and Genshin Impact.\n\n## Graphic Design\n\nThe graphics tend to be bright, colorful, and stylized with a cell-shaded style. All characters have a design resembling a mix of MegaMan Battle Network’s Net Navis and Viruses, Pokemon, and Stands from Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure.\n\n## Audio Design\n\nMost of the OST features a mix of techno audio and instruments prominent in various other genres such as orchestra, rock, jazz, and country depending on the scenarios associated with it.\n\n## Monetization\n\nThe game will be either purchasable with Triple-A pricing possibly with DLC-priced addons or free with optional premium currency including an optional subscription for a periodic allowance of premium currency.\n\n# Story\n\n## Background Lore\n\nReality is divided into multiple layers with different types of beings inhabiting each. Beings that live in higher layers have greater knowledge and power, but have fates subject to the actions of beings in lower layers similar to how humans live, die, and decompose in accordance to things smaller than they can see. On the highest layer, beings have very few limits to what they can do, but the worlds they live in are created and destroyed in accordance to the thoughts, feelings, and actions of the beings on the lower layers. You are the consciousness of a being that was too powerful to end after your body died, so it was able to sustain itself by transcending to the highest layer and saturate itself into a mass of ethereal energy to create an object called a Soul that is able to interact with the Worlds around it from within a body so as to combat the beings that seek to destroy all worlds.\n\n## Terminology\n\n### Zone\n\nA Zone is a world within the highest layer of reality. There are new ones being created all the time. Different Zones have specific environments and are divided into areas called Acts, along with a number of gimmicks specific to it.\n\n### Acts\n\nActs are essentially the levels of the game that each have their own specific task to complete. From the Player’s hub, they can be accessed to go to. After a sufficient number of Acts are cleared, the player can go to a free-roam area within the Zone that has many different collectables to find, random events that can offer rewards of some sort, and services that can be performed. Most Acts have optional Tasks and branching paths that can be completed for greater rewards, sometimes with greater difficulty. Most Acts have gimmicks with different mechanics specific to the Zone that can aid in traversing it or benefit the player in some other way. Some Acts have periodic Events which can affect most of the mechanics within it. Acts can also possess Hazards which can either Damage the player with different Attributes or with skill can be taken advantage of to damage enemies.\n\nGoal Acts simply involve getting to the end of the Act, often combatting enemies along the way.\n\nDungeon Acts feature many puzzles that must be completed to get to the goal, often with some actions in one area affecting the environment in the other.\n\nHunt Acts involve finding one or more hidden or hard to access things called Objectives within an open area, but usually there are ways to obtain hints for finding and accessing them.\n\nBoss Acts involve facing off with an exceptionally powerful enemy of some sort, which can sometimes only be made vulnerable with gimmicks across the arena.\n\nChallenge Acts are special acts that often come with rules or modifiers that make it harder somehow or require different skills.\n\nLimited Acts are special and only happen in cycles of real-world time. They offer unique rewards and challenges not found in others.\n\n### Morphs\n\nA Morph are beings on the highest layer born from a concept created by the beings on the lower layers. They will spend their existence living according to their instincts to follow a specific purpose or pattern of actions and react in a specific way to certain types of stimuli. Different types of Morphs live in different Zones and may help the player if assisted.\n\n### Hollows\n\nHollows are the main antagonists in the game. They are essentially beings that lack Souls and are driven purely by Willpower and are born from it when it “boils over” as a result of the feelings of beings in the lower layers becoming intensified. They are very hostile to the Zones and any beings they may find. If too many of them are within one Zone at one time, the Zone will be destroyed, so most beings make an effort to destroy them when they find them. They can come in an endless number of forms with more being discovered all the time, each with their own sets of physical and supernatural abilities. The intelligence of a Hollow tends to scale with its power, with stronger ones being able to command and organize weaker ones. There are rumours of Hollows intelligent enough to communicate with Souls that are able to command Hollows across multiple Zones.\n\n### Quirk\n\nQuirk constitutes the substance of the world. All Quirk is made of the same basic subatomic substance, but can exist in countless forms depending on how the substance is structured and can possess one or more of countless properties in the form it takes. How Quirk is structured largely depends on the Zone it comes from.\n\n### Willpower\n\nWillpower is the energy that drives all things in the Zones. It can be applied an endless number of ways and serves as the fuel source for all supernatural phenomena in the Zones.\n\n### Symbols\n\nSymbols are objects made of Quirk that are saturated with Willpower. They are used to create or improve things in the universe by the Souls inhabiting it. Different Zones will play host to different types of Symbols. Symbols can be found by clearing Acts, completing certain Tasks, hidden away at certain points, by defeating Hollows, or by interacting with certain things in certain ways.\n\n### Traces\n\nTraces are essentially smaller pieces of Quirk saturated with Willpower that serve as the currency of the game and are used as a fuel source by most beings. They can be found pretty much anywhere and are required to complete most actions involving creating or upgrading things.\n\n### Egos\n\nAn Ego is a body a Soul may inhabit. An Ego is born from a great deed that was able to affect the lives of countless other beings in dramatic ways. With a Soul animating it, it can produce Willpower to use a gallery of abilities at its disposal called Corpus. Each Ego also has a usable object that it can make appear or disappear at will called a Figment. Figments can be either a handheld tool or weapon, an extension of their body, an animate figure that it can control like a puppet, or some manner of trinket or apparatus that serves as the medium for a supernatural force.\n\n# Gameplay\n\n## Gameplay Overview\n\nUpon first arriving, the player is instructed to choose one of several Egos that offer different starting experiences that can all be obtained at a later point. Players will obtain more Egos after crafting them from Symbols and Traces. All Egos can be upgraded a Level upon using required Symbols and the necessary amount of Traces. An Ego's capabilities scale from their Level.\n\nAll Acts have Checkpoints that can be warped between. It serves as a point where the Player can Regenerate a new Ego in their Party at once their current Ego is Defeated after losing all its HP. If all Egos are Defeated, the Player gets a Game Over and is forced back to their Hub.\n\nPlayers can also join or create Multiplayer Rooms to cooperate with and/or compete against other Players. If an Act requires an Ego with a specific set of abilities or traits, it will suggest them. If the player does not have that Ego in their possession, they can use a Rental Ego for use in that Act.\n\n## Controls\n\n### Dualshock\n\nA: Jump, Aerial\n\nB: Interact, Variable Input\n\nY: Unique\n\nX: Corpus\n\nRB: Guard, Deflect\n\nRT: Attack\n\nLT: Dash, Run\n\nLB: Lock Target, Lock Hold\n\nControl Pad: Select Item/Party Member, Use Item/Switch Party Member\n\nLeft Stick: Movement\n\nLeft Stick Press: Toggle Look Mode\n\nRight Stick: Camera\n\nRight Stick Press: Sneak\n\nStart: Pause Menu, Options, Quit Area, Quit Game\n\nSelect: Menu, Inventory, Info Log\n\n### Keyboard\n\nSpace: Jump, Aerial\n\nF: Corpus\n\nR: Interact, Variable Input.\n\nV: Unique\n\nR: Dash, Run\n\nLMB: Attack\n\nRMB: Guard, Deflect\n\nMMB: Lock Target, Hold Lock\n\nDirectional Inputs: Select Item, Use Item\n\nWASD: Movement\n\n1: Look Mode\n\nMouse: Camera\n\nTab: Sneak\n\nEsc: Pause Menu, Options, Quit Area, Quit Game\n\nTab: Character Menu, Inventory, Info Log\n\n## Combat\n\n### Basics\n\nPlayers have two meters that tell for three vital resources Hit Points (HP) and Will Points (WP) When an Ego takes Damage from an enemy Attack or a Hazard, they lose HP relative to their Resistances and severity of the Damage. When a player’s current Ego runs out of HP they are forced to restart at their last used Save Point or switch to another Ego in the Party.\n\nEvery Ego has a Normal Attack activated by pressing the Attack Input and an Advanced Attack activated by holding the Attack Input which often comes with certain mechanics that can amplify damage in certain ways or under certain conditions. The player can destroy Hollows by Attacking them and reducing their HP to zero. In response to Hollow’s attacks, players can avoid them by Dashing by pressing the Dash input or Jumping by holding it and going in a certain direction. If a player is adept at reading the Hollow’s attacks, they can take advantage of their momentary Recovery periods between attacks to damage them without leaving them a chance to defend.\n\nPlayers can also Defend against Hollows’ attacks by holding the Guard input, which neutralizes all damage on contact but if the number or power of blocked attacks passes a certain threshold, it puts the player into the Staggered state. The Defense constantly regenerates, but once Staggered the player can’t Attack, Defend, use Active Corpus, for multiple frames depending on their Defense Regeneration By pressing the Guard input rather than holding it, they can Deflect an attack instead, which drains an opponent's Defense instead, however this only lasts for a brief moment and can easily lead to damage if the player misreads the Attack. Some Attacks can’t be Guarded against without a shield of some sort, but they can be Deflected. Some Attacks can’t be Guarded or Deflected regardless of the presence of a shield. Most non-cannon fodder Hollows will actively Guard between Attacks and uses of Corpus, so the player must be aggressive so as to put them into the Staggered state. Some Hollows and Egos regenerate their Defense at an accelerated rate, but when any character has low HP they enter a state called Pressed where their Defense regenerates at a greatly diminished rate.\n\nPlayers also have opportunities to do increased damage to foes called Critical Hits. Their first would be to attack their Weak Point (Ex head), their Blind Side (Ex back) and while they are unaware of their presence (asleep), usually facilitated by Sneaking. Each Ego has a Critical Stat which determines how much a Critical Hit multiplies the damage.\n\n### Corpus\n\nThe most effective way of Damaging foes and Defending against attacks would be to use Active Corpus. Even Active Corpus used by Egos with Very Low Active Corpus Damage tend to do slightly more Damage than an attack with a Very High Attack Damage stat. The use of Corpus requires the expenditure of WPs. WPs are counted as sections of the WP Bar, which fills as the player Attacks, Guards powerful Attacks, Deflects at the last moment, and Dashes and Jumps to avoid attacks at the last moment. Different Egos have different lengths of WP bars. Most attacks have some kind of attribute that are either Physical and Energy based and each character has different Resistances to each of them. Physical Attributes are Slash, Pierce, and Crush. Energy Attributes are Pyro, Cryo, EMag, Bio, Chem, Grav, Psi, and Ether.\n\nCorpus can take many different forms such as some manner of specialized Attack technique, some manner of physical projectiles, magic spell-like Force projections, the creation of a Construct, a temporary Buff or positive Effect, self-healing, an Attack that bestows a Status Ailment, Debuff or Negative Effect of some sort, Attacks that do increased Damage once certain conditions are fulfilled, something that affects the whole Act, or something that isn’t always related to combat like an action that assists in traversing the environment.\n\n### Possible Advanced Attacks\n\nA few examples of Advanced Attacks include thrust attacks which can't be blocked or always deflected unless the target is using a form of shield, flailing attacks which can deal damage regardless of how the target attempts to block or deflect them and can sometimes temporarily disable foes' attacks, sweeping attacks which can damage groups of foes, low attacks that can only be avoided through aerial maneuvers such as jumping, ranged or projectile attacks which can harm foes from an extended distance, charge attacks where the character can quickly cover the distance to a foe, rush attacks which start combos that strike quicker in succession than the normal attack, burst attacks which strike multiple times in rapid succession, heavy attacks which do chip damage even if the attack itself is blocked or parried, and grab attacks which can't be blocked or deflected and can even launch foes into hazards or other foes for further damage.\n\n## Items\n\nItems are actively used objects that serve many purposes including healing damage or restoring critical resources. Some items can be stacked but in turn are consumable. Some items have multiple uses but must be recharged between Acts, and some have unlimited uses but are only useful in very specific situations. Different Egos have more or less slots for Items and the player can decide which ones in the party can get them between Acts.\n\n## Artifacts\n\nArtifacts act as the equipment in the game, boosting an Ego’s stats and endowing them with passive effects. Some Egos can equip more at once than others. Some dramatically increase some stats but endow a negative effect of some sort. Some endow very useful passive effects but “break” and disappear under the right conditions.\n\n# Specific Egos\n\nNote: Each Ego can have its color pallets freely swapped by the player and may have optional skins which change its model.\n\n## Morthir\n\n### Profile\n\nA tall Ego resembling a suit of plate armor with a cape.

The primary event runs on a 12-minute cycle. During the 6 minute day cycle it is easy to traverse and the Morphs are active and are involved in Tasks that are either helping the animals obtain food or playing games with the fairies. During the 6 minute night cycle, the Hollows become active and several plant-based hazards emerge, however several alternate paths and routes also open up leading to greater rewards.\n\n### Morphs\n\nDeerling: Morphs that must be herded to areas of tall grass, the pronged ones have a chance to become aggressive if agitated and can sometimes get into fights which can be broken up. The ones without prongs are faster but more skittish and harder to herd but offer greater rewards once herded to tall grass.\n\nSquirrely: Skittish Morphs that hide when an Ego gets near but can be gently coaxed to the Ego after picking up a piece of Quirk resembling a nut and holding still.\n\nBirdee: Morphs that sing certain notes in response to the basic actions of an Ego. They lurk in areas that have hints to what notes need to be played in what order to complete Tasks.\n\nFengo: Skittish creatures that once spotted run away and will disappear when far enough.

The Alpha among them will periodically howl to summon more and must be defeated to end the fight. Vulnerable to Pierce.\n\nStrignox: Owl-like Hollows that can turn invisible and reappear right before attacking in a divebomb with Pierce. Occasionally they’ll appear and perch somewhere to charge a wide-radius Ether that Confuses the Ego and makes their next input completely randomized. Vulnerable to Grav.\n\nPinechin: A ball of spikes with feet that extend them in response to an attack to Guard and deal counteractive damage but will become vulnerable when they charge a burstfire Pierce projectile. Vulnerable to Crush.\n\nUrsix: A large bear-like Hollow that has an onslaught mode where they charge forward but can’t Guard and an upright combat mode where they Guard between combo attacks that do chip damage. Occasionally, they’ll telegraph a grab attack that deals heavy base damage. Vulnerable to Pyro.\n\nCoqador: A large chicken-like Hollow that can Dash to avoid pretty much any attack. It will strike with great speed and precision with either a three-combo Pierce pecking attack or a leaping double-strike Slash talon attack. At long ranges, it will become vulnerable as it coughs up and launches an explosive feathered egg-like projectile that is flung high up but will slowly but strongly home in on the Ego. Vulnerable to EMag.\n\nTorkus: A very large turtle-like hollow that can stand upright to Attack and Guard. When it’s Staggered, it will instead curl up in its shell to do either a spinning attack with strong homing or a very fast rolling attack. It cannot be normally damaged with Attacks but it can be forced into a patch of explosive mushroom-like Quirk that pop up at night for heavy damage. Vulnerable to Cryo.\n\n## Symphony City\n\n### Description\n\nA place full of structures resembling musical instruments. It’s full of gimmicks and hazards that activate in response to certain parts of the song and has metronome-like gimmicks which can trigger events that make the gimmicks and hazards activate faster or slower.\n\n### Morphs\n\nNotez: Morphs that resemble musical notes that must be placed in the correct order on sheet music to complete their tasks. They are normally very skittish but will gather around certain gimmicks once they are triggered.\n\nDivauto: A Morph resembling a mechanical doll that comes out once certain points in the music come up to sing, but the machinery surrounding it often has damage that causes it to sing badly. Fixing it will solve the Task.\n\nConductauto: A morph resembling a mechanical conductor that attempts to conduct a row of mechanical instruments that often get their parts wrong. Different instruments have different methods to get them to follow along, completing the Task.\n\n### Hollows\n\nStringz: A small spider-like Hollow with body parts resembling stringed instruments. It will launch its metal wire-like webbing to Bind the Ego and pluck them to send Grav attacks at them. Vulnerable to Slash.\n\nHorntar: A stationary Hollow resembling a cannon and brass horn that can attack from very long ranges with splash projectile Grav attacks. Vulnerable to Cryo.\n\nSkill Piper: A Hollow holding a clarinet-like instrument who’s song severely drains all of an Ego’s stats as long as it’s being played. Vulnerable to Pyro.\n\nDrumster: A hollow resembling a large drum with two drumstick-like arms that deal Crush chip-damage. Can’t be hurt from the front while not Staggered and causes most projectile attacks to rebound back at the Ego. Will occasionally root itself to play a song which boosts the Damage and attack Speed of all nearby Hollows. Vulnerable to Pierce.\n\nSqueezy: A hollow with two accordion-like arms that can extend to attack from a distance. It will occasionally play a song which Entrances the Ego, forcing them to Lock-On to it and only it. Vulnerable to Slash.\n\nDiscordo: A Hollow that normally hides inside of its invincible piano that charges to attack.

You as your character have to travel all over the world learning about The Gods and The Titans (Cronus and his Siblings and Parents) to then gain your God Powers since you haven’t discovered them yet. Over the game time you will discover many allies and befriend lots of people whilst fighting many Enemies and Foes on your way to Hades. After confronting Hades, he corrupts the world with darkness and you have to fight him."

It would be so cool to find and learn about these made of civilizations.
kloxyu,Infinite magazine size which effects damage and reload time,"This is a mechanic for a non-serious FPS game. You can shoot as many bullets without reloading as you like, but the catch is that damage goes down slightly over time (which insentivises reloading) and the longer you shoot for, the longer the reload takes. This would obviously need some tweaking but that's the basic idea."

klgin8,"You're the death, grim reaper","You are the grim reaper. The one who is bringing dead souls to the afterlife. \nYou must pick conversation options to calm the dead and make them go through the 5 stages of grief. You listen to their stories and maybe visit their past in memories. Souls can refuse transportation. Then you can either give them up and collect them some other time, or leave them forever, or force them.\nWhy would you force them? Because dead relatives want to see them again in the ""afterdeath"" a place where all dead souls come after they die. From there it goes further to different options: heaven, hell, purgatory,  rebirth, valhalla and everything else. All exists to make the souls comfortable.\nYou must choose who to support. If you anger the long dead, they will do bad changes. If you anger the fresh dead, they will make a scene. You must determine what is best for the afterdeath. What you do will determine the way the afterdeath is going to be. Chaos? Special traditions of the afterdeath? New patterns of behaviour? Everything will be the same?\n\nYou must determine what the dead person truly wants. They might think they want something. But in reality you know they would much rather do something else or it may be better. Sure, you can lie. But that might not work. This might anger them.\nThe souls are mostly human. Some animals have strong souls and that's why you have to deal with them. (There's a grim reaper for animals, humans are too different tho.)\nYour ultimate goal is to keep the afterdeath nice and friendly. Your second goal is to have the souls calm and ready for transport. \nYour third goal is to have the old souls happy.\nThe least important goal is to be rather quick. It takes time tho. But spend too Much time on a soul and you have too much work, which means that you need much time.... the time limit per soul is very generous.\nI was thinking about a 2d pixelated style. You can decorate your reaper."
klg5mj,Looking for some new ideas!,"I've recently been kind of out of ideas, and due to this I've been way less motivated on doing anything at all. I'm looking for some new ideas, literally anything. If it sounds stupid? Who cares, whacky games can be really fun. Any ideas at all! Thanks for your time and support!"
kled9w,Breath of the Wild meets StarDew Valley meets The Edge Chronicles,"TL;DR- Sort of Skyward StarDew Valley/Breath of the Wild thing that focuses on taming and utilizing animal’s to maximize your production and upgrade to the highest quality homestead you can, while also building relationships and renown. \n\nBasically take all the exploring and atmosphere from Breath of the Wild and put it into game that’s more about managing your property, taking part in the game world’s economy and creating relationships with the inhabitants.\n\nHere’s an example of how I would build it.\n\nThe world is incredibly vertical, homesteads, towns, even the Capitol City are all perched atop large mesa’s and carved into cliff sides. They all build above the cloud line as there is something sinister about the haze.\n\nEveryone travels by magical sky ships that resemble sea vessels with some aerodynamic flare to them. You can purchase either entire ships, or their blueprints and build them yourself. Bigger ships are slower, but can take more hits and hold more crew to assist you, smaller ones can’t carry as much but pirates will have a hard time catching you.\n\nMonsters inhabit the ground level, claiming a majority of of the land for themselves. People only venture down to scavenge from the ruins of the old world and to gather up materials for crafting things. \n\nYou play as the typical, I’ve inherited this old run down farm out in the middle of nowhere protagonist. Maybe you just crash land who knows.  The Mesa you start on is relatively small, the aim being to earn enough to buy new bigger plots around the map.\n\nInstead of the focus being on farming, this games focus would be on animal husbandry. The animals are incredibly violent below the clouds, but when raised above them they’re perfectly happy and willing to assist you with gaining access to more and more valuable materials. Some animals produce them, others have abilities that aid you in gathering or tending to crops and that kind of thing.\n\nExamples:\n\nA Giant Cow slug creature who’s slime trails can be scooped up and turned into fuel, or even cooked into food.\n\nA giant gecko like creature that allows you to quickly access resources at the base of your Mesa without having to waste fuel for your airship.\n\nA flying mount that can be called should you fall and have to glide your way to the ground level.\n\nAn amphibious creature that periodically sprays nutrient rich water everywhere, feeding any plants nearby.\n\nSmall dexterous creatures that will gather crops and things marked for sale and put them into the trade box while you’re away.\n\nThe gameplay loop  is essentially take your airship down below, gather materials for crafting, some treasure if you can, and more importantly try and sneak away an egg from a nest, as that is the only way you can domesticate them. You’ll need to incubate it and then raise it to adulthood when it hatches. Only adults have the abilities and skills that will help you as you progress. \n\nOnce you’ve gathered a decent stockpile you can stick it all in your trade-box to be picked up and sold. The game basically works more like stardew valley than Breath of the Wild. There’s no epic story to take part, there’s no big bad to face. It’s just living in this world, making friends, creating a family, raising animals and maybe fighting a monster or two. There’s a calendar and seasons and different seasons will affect the biomes in different ways. \n\nI think a fun spin you could take with it is having to fend off sky pirates. Basically any time you send items through the trade box, there is a chance the delivery gets robbed and you lose all that supply. So you can opt out of that and just fly the items you want to sell to the nearest vendor yourself. Different vendors will offer better prices depending on their specialty and also the time of year. You can still be attacked but it’s much less likely and hiring crew for you ship will make the fight much easier. \n\nAnyway that’s just an idea I had while playing a Star Dew Valley-ish game. I just felt like man it would really be improved if you had some of the exploratory gameplay elements from Breath of the Wild, like climbing and gliding, as well as having an expansive map to explore. Plus I’m always down for some sky boats and magical monster shit."

Anyways, let me know your thoughts.\n\n\n\nPremise\n\nYou are the leader of a organization pitted against a rival political group in a game where resource management, public relations, and strategic prowess will be your main weapons. In gameplay combining real-time strategy, brawler-based combat, and RPG elements, your faction will have to manage your image to the public, avoid apprehension by the police, and successfully disrupt rival protests and demonstrations while masterfully executing some of your own. In times such as these, it is easy for things to descend into chaos but in a battle of ideologies, only one can emerge victorious. Will you come down hard on your opponents with propaganda, general hooliganism, or blunt objects? Draw up a battle plan and take the streets in the ultimate battle of wits between the dim-witted!\n\nOverview\n\nThe game is broken up into 6 demonstrations; 3 organized by your faction, 3 by your opponent. Your goal is to successfully defend or disrupt demonstrations using whatever tactics your choose. Your success is measured by three factors; mission success, public opinion, and police indifference. Mission success refers to how successful your faction was in disrupting or defending a demonstration; factors include propaganda put up or destroyed, how many civilians joined your cause, financial and physical damage caused to the rival faction, and the duration of the demonstration. Public opinion refers to your reputation in the community; factors include positive/negative interactions, illegal acts committed in public, and depiction in media sources. Police indifference refers to the response by police; factors include arrests of rival or affiliated members, damages to the public, and violence committed against police. At the end of each skirmish, points in each area will be averaged and at the end of the 6 demonstrations, a winner will be declared, which is determined by highest average score.\n\nFactions\n\nYou are the leader of a customizable political faction designed to oppose the agenda of the rival faction. You can choose your own name for the group, write a bio/description, cosmetically customize every individual member, and select the political stance of your group on a variety of topics. Your responses will give your group various boosts or penalties in various areas. The rival group will have ideologies randomly generated to generally contrast yours.\n\nTopics:\n\nAbortion\nLGBT Adoption Rights\nReproductive Health Funding\nGay Marriage\nSexual Assault Response\nGender Identity\nReligious Freedom\nWomen in the Military\nWorkplace Diversity\nCapital Punishment\nConfederate Monuments\nSafe Spaces\nMedically Assisted Suicide\nFirst Amendment \nBorder Policy\nTreatment of Illegal Immigrants\nImmigration Ban\nDeportation\nAssimilation of Migrants\nSanctuary Cities\nDual Citizenship\nCitizenship Requirements\nGun Control\nArmed Teachers\nReligion-based Surveillance\nCongressional Term Limits\nGerrymandering\nDrug Policy\nSocial Media Regulation\nData Protection\nDomestic Surveillance\nGun Liability\nNet Neutrality\nFlag Burning\nEminent Domain\nWhistleblower Protection\nSocial Security\nSingle Payer Healthcare\nDrug Price Regulation\nMental Illness\nRecreational Drug Use\nMedicaid\nEqual Pay\nWelfare Drug Testing\nTax Rates\nPaid Sick Leave\nMinimum Wage\nCorporate Tax\nWelfare Requirements\nGovernment Spending\nLabor Unions\nTariffs\nJob Outsourcing\nEstate Tax\nFarming Subsidies\nProperty Tax\nGovernment Pensions\nBanking Reform\nCryptocurrencies \nClimate Change\nAlternative Energy\nOff-shore Drilling\nPlastic Product Ban\nCampaign Finance\nForeign Lobbying\nRepublican Democracy\nVoter Freud\nCandidate Transparency\nMinimum Voting Age\nCriminal Politicians\nVoting Rights of Criminals\nDaft\nMandatory Military Service\nTorture\nRefugee Requirements\nTerrorist Rights\nForeign Aid\nForeign Military Intervention\nMilitary Spending\nGMO Labels\nMandatory Vaccinations\nPolice Body Cameras\nSolitary Confinement\nPolice Brutality\nPolice Discrimination\nDrug Penalties\nPrison Overcrowding\nPrison Reform\nStudent Loans\nCharter Schools\nPublic Transportation\nGender Equality\nRacial Equality\nDisaster Preparedness\nGovernment Accountability\nAnti-Fascism\nFake News\nViolence in the Media\nProtester Rights\nSquatters Rights\nProtection of the Homeless\nCollege or Trade Preparedness\nSecular Government\nDomestic Terrorism\nVeteran Services\nPolitical Prisoners\nDrug Treatment\nEthical Treatment of Animals\n\nYour faction leader has 5 skills that will determine their effectiveness in the following areas;\n\nInfluence; effects the ability to sway opinion\nCharisma; effects the ability to recruit new members\nResourcefulness; effects the ability to earn experience\nResponsibility; effects the ability to earn money\nElusiveness; effects the ability to evade police\n\nEach of these skills are on a 10 point scale, 5 being average, with no boosts or penalties.\n\nYour faction will have members to assist you in various aspects of the game. Some roles have great impact when preparing for an upcoming demonstration, some during the demonstration itself, and/or during both.\n\nBefore a demonstration, there are various activities you can engage divided into three categories. Category one is intelligence activities that serve to provide you with information about the next demonstration that can help your prepare. Valuable information include basic map layouts, police presence, media and civilian turnout, opposition numbers/roles, and potential for riots. The information gathered has a varying range of accuracy depending on the skill level of members tasked with intelligence activities. Category two is community activities that serve to either generate money for the demonstration or effect public opinion. This can effect public support, police turnout, media awareness, and earn money which can be used to purchase gear, demonstration tools, bribe police, or pay bail. Category three is preparation activities that finalize your demonstration roster, members gear, and allows you to spend XP on members to grant skill increases.\n\nDemonstrations are broken up into two parts. Part one is preparation mode. Depending on what roles you have to your disposal, certain things can be done to ensure success of the event. This gives you the opportunity to explore the map, examine police presence, make an impression on the media, and sabotage the opposition. During this time, you can either control the individual units directly or control groups overhead with limited control. Some actions require direct control of characters and some require overhead squad control. Part two is the actual demonstration itself. During this time, you can control individual members or squads to carry out a variety of tasks. You can vandalize property, put up propaganda posters, record events on camera, assault opposing members/police, distract police, disrupts demonstrators, fend of attackers, and cause a riot. A riot occurs when a “hype” meter is filled to full capacity. When a riot occurs, rival and friendly faction members have difficulty following orders, police arrest faction members indiscriminately, civilians join in on the action, general lawlessness ensues, and the demonstration ends once the crowd is dispersed. Your actions during the demonstration determine your overall event score.\n\nDuring gameplay, each member has 6 things keep track of; health, stamina, wanted level, visibility, spirit, and special. Health shows the health of the unit. When health is at 10%, the unit is incapacitated, rendering them useless until the are healed by a medic, apprehended by police, or fatally wounded. Stamina will drain over time while doing strenuous activity. If it reaches 0%, they are rendered incapacitated until stamina is recovered to 90%. Wanted level determines if police are actively searching for the unit or not. Visibility determines how many people are watching what the unit is doing. Spirit is a bar that indicates how enthusiastic they are about the mission. If the bar is full, they will resist arrest from police and follow orders better. The special bar allows for the units to execute special abilities."

I want to make a game that is 2d and has multiplayer. The only thing hindering me is that I do not know what type of game to make!\n\nIf you have a reasonable game idea that would be fun to play with friends, post it in the comments so I can have a look!"
kl7rfk,Team based fish game,"I was thinking of a team based attack game (similar to ow, maybe 5-6 person teams) where the ""heroes"" you use are different aquatic creatures. And maps are of course underwater, movement is swimming. \n\nI like the idea of classes, tank, damage, healing, etc. I think the roster size has some pretty great potential since there's a lot of shit in the ocean.\n\nThe most challenging part in my head would be making movement that isn't frustrating and allows you to easily play the objective or get kills or whatever playstyle you go with."
kl6re2,A Medieval version of Doom,"Feel free to use this idea:  This would be a Medieval 1st person shooter.  The mechanics should be very similar to Doom.\n\nStory: The game is set close to the end of the second Crusade in 1149.  The Church knew that it was going badly.  A desperate and angry bishop attempted to make a deal with demons to secure victory, and opened up a portal to Hell. The demons promised to unleash their fury on the Church’s Muslim enemies.  This was technically true, but in their conversations with the bishop, they left out the part about killing everyone else on Earth too.  As soon as the portal opened, demons poured out and started slaughtering everyone. The dead were transformed into zombies, and numerous cities became havens for undead and demons.\n\nThe protagonist:  You play the role of a city guard trained in the crossbow. You just completed your basic training, and are essentially some nobody that gets caught in the middle of this. You live in one of the villages that was slaughtered and reanimated.  Starting the game surrounded by your neighbors that are now undead monsters trying to kill you, you must fight to survive.  It’s up to you to fight your way through the Hellspawn horde, gradually figure out what happened, and defeat the demon lord Orcus and destroy the portal.\n\nPart 1: The Necropolis.  The first part of the game takes place above ground.  You must venture through numerous stages. Each stage is a village or city that has been destroyed and corrupted. You primarily fight with zombies and weaker demons.\n\nPart 2:  The Catacombs.  This part of the game is underground. The enemies are substantially harder.  Here, you battle liches, skeletal knights, and more powerful demons. At the end of Part 2, you must battle the bishop, who is now fully corrupted and loyal to the Devil.  From there, you take the portal to Abaddon.\n\nPart 3: Abaddon.  This is the region of Hell where the demon lord Orcus resides.  His intention is to build an undead army to conquer the Earth.  From here on, the enemies are difficult.  Once Orcus is defeated, you must destroy the portal and escape. \n\nWeapon: Your weapon would be a crossbow.  This would not change throughout the game. Crossbows fire bolts, and different types of bolts would have different effects. You’d start with standard bolts, but you’d also find rapid-fire bolts, explosive bolts, poisoned bolts, fire and ice bolts, holy bolts, etc.  Ammo would be found throughout the game much like in Doom.  When you run out of ammo, you have a dagger.\n\nManeuverability: The game allows 3-D motion.  A computer mouse should be used to aim, and the arrow keys are for moving in different directions.  For game systems with controllers, one stick should be for aiming and one for moving.  You can also jump, crouch, and run (which depletes stamina).\n\nHealth: 100% is full health, and you die when your health reaches 0%. If you die, then you must begin at the beginning of that stage.  Healing potions can be found throughout the game, which recover health.\n\nArmor:  You start with your clothes.  Later in the game, you can find leather armor, which reduces damage by 10%. Further in the game, you find copper armor, which reduces damage by 20%, and then iron armor (30%) and divine armor (40%). You’ll need those armor improvements, since enemies get harder and inflict more damage as the game progresses."

kkzzp1,Game that can be played for money,"So this is a concept that can be applied to most online video games first you would need to create a economy and through that economy prices of items could fluctuate depending on the worth of the coin ,the coin is like bit coin as in it rises in worth the less of it there is available. You would get the coin via trades monsters etc but you would get less of the coin depending on the worth. It would have a inbuilt trading and selling system where you could sell the coins(you would have to wait for a buyer so as not to lose the dev money) thus creating a money-making game that doesn’t scam you. Obviously you could as to make more money add dlcs that add more powerful items and the people that get the dlc can then sell those items to the normal players.you could also make it really expensive."

kkwl2d,a game set in a cyberpunk mega building with Metroidvania level design/rogue-like.,"It can be the setting for any game type really. But the best fitting ones could be either a rogue-like or an immersive sim.\n\nI came up with this while brainstorming my own game's outline. The goal for the setting was that it is small enough but also interesting enough to explore and would make sense lore-wise(Also justifies some level of repetitiveness in level design).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo those who are unfamiliar with the term, A ""mega building"" is a concept inspired by the now-demolished 九龍寨城 (Kowloon Walled City) in HongKong, that a giant building would house tens of thousands of people and provides them with all they ever need from birth to death, all in one place. Like in the building you would find restaurants, gyms, dentists, nail salons, even warehouses and funeral homes. Due to the size of the building, the environment may changes drastically as you go up or down. It may even have ""rough neighbourhoods"" and multiple community centres etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey are featured, somewhat, in Cyberpunk2077. But it just feels like going into a condo building.  The concept itself however, can easily be its own game."
kkweo3,A Post-apocalyptic survival game where you play as a reactivated robot who is dead set on finding it's creator.,"You would play as a robot who was put to sleep right before the end of the world. When you eventually wake up, the world is a ruined dystopia with only small factions of humanity. You don't remember much but you have a longing to be reunited with your creator/master. You know your master has a microchip that can be tracked with advanced enough technology. A beacon of hope per se. You set out into the new world hoping for that one reunion.\n\nInstead of having to keep track of regular human conditions, you are a robot that needs Power (Sleep), Gasoline and Oil (Hunger and Thirst), and to take care of your Chassis (Health). Instead of sleeping at a bed, you recharge at a power station, you require gas and oil for functioning, and taking damage will slowly debuff you requiring to repair yourself to get back to normal. \n\nYou can craft tools and weapons, but you will be using most resources to make modifications to your robotic body. Ranging from arm laser blasters, to decreased oil and gas consumption, to night vision, to even robotic allies!\n\nThe world you are put into is like a post apocalyptic cyberpunk society, full of advanced technology but also ruin and decay, dead robots and a dying humanity.  You will run into some humans, but only a handful of them who aren't in a faction will be friendly.\n\nHave any questions, ideas, or feedback?"
kkv50f,Idea for a Football Card Game,"In the past, there is was a game called Toon Cup Superstars, I know the rule ""**Please do not post blatant copies of already existing games.**"" but since that game no longer exist, I don't see why not make a game that **only** has the same mechanics as this game.\n\nIt's very simple, the match begin with both soccer players in the middle of the field, you have 4 cards in your hand, as well your opponent, both of you can play a card to advance a specific number of steps with more steps more close to the goal you are, and the more closer you are to the goal, higher is your chance to make a score, there is also specials cards; cards that show your opponent's hand, a card that make you and your opponent go to the middle of the field and then you try to make a score to the goal, when your are in the opponent's field, you automatically try to make a score to the goal, but if the opponent is in your field they also will automatically try to make a score. And the cards can be upgraded to the maximum of 3 levels, but you can't upgrade specials cards, when you upgrade a card, it increased the number of steps you can make when you play that card, unfortunately, I don't remember how do you upgrade cards (it is with money, or repeated cards?)\n\nI wish I could explain more about that game, but it's been so long the last time I played that game, so I don't remember the game at all, I also tried to put here some screenshots from that game but r/gameideas don't allow me, so instead I'll leave a link to more information about [Toon Cup Superstars](https://theamazingworldofgumball.fandom.com/wiki/Toon_Cup:_Superstars)\n\n Sorry my english btw :)"

kku7h6,DISCORD/3D WORLD?,"Imagine a discord update/service (nitro exclusive for example idk) where every server has their own 'room' or 'world' similar to the likes of Second Life or Playstation Home. Members of the server can join (or if some members want to remain in discord chat, thats not a problem too) and customise their avatar and such. In the world of micro transactions, profitability wouldn't be a problem with virtual clothing items etc the user can have. Companies can have ads in certain places for certain promotions etc too. In the height of Discord's relevance with millions and millions of users, with Jason's background with game development and the possible connections that he has, I think it would really take off or even spark something in the creative team. Additionally, as the future of gaming is looking more and more into VR support, VR would be available but not a necessity for the service. Of course this is just an idea but I really think it would be a big step ahead for Discord in terms of social interaction."

ippj4n,3rd Person - Rags to Riches - Trader to Carnival Leader,"TL;DR\n\n3rd Person Perspective\n\nAction-Combo or JRPG Turn-Based\n\nStarting as a poor villager you slowly upgrade your first trading cart, collecting goods to craft and trade for wealth, using wealth to upgrade your trading cart to a wagon, and purchase various facilities for you settlement. Your trading wagon travels along paths and roads, with handcars and trains unlocked later. Paths, roads and railroads pass through settlements of various sizes, with railroads providing more economic boost to a settlement than roads, and roads more than paths. Use your trading wagon to ferry your collected goods between regions using the interconnected series of paths, roads and railroads as you explore each region on foot to collect those goods. Your trading directly impacts the economy and growth of each settlement, and as a small settlement grows it can develop connections to the road network and eventually railroad network, which can further increase its growth rate.\n\nIf this idea intrigues you please read further below for more detail, and feel free to share your feedback and/or suggestions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 1. Theme and Setting\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* High Fantasy/Steampunk/Western\n\nIt's the birth of a new Empire. Cities have begun springing up surrounding prominent Faction and Family Strongholds and leaders began banding together in a network of trade and mutual aide with the shared goal of protecting these Stronghold Cities and strengthening their economic growth. Among the leaders of these Strongholds an 	Emperor is elected, with other leaders acting as Advisors. Roads begin to replace Paths, crisscrossing Regions in order to establish firm connections between these bustling Stronghold Cities, but without a thriving industry many settlements are left disconnected from these economic arteries, down dusty, overgrown Paths barely manageable by mule. Near the rural edge of a Region containing one of these Stronghold Cities lies your Home Settlement, down one of those dusty, overgrown Paths.\n\n \n\n# 2. Gameplay\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Player traverses the world, Hunting, Crafting, Collecting and Trading Goods to sell. When the Player's inventory is full they deposit their Goods into their cart(Transport) for storage until sale. The Player can move around freely on foot, but their Transport is locked to the Path/Road/Rail it is on. So players can explore the environment for Goods, but they must return to their Transport to deposit Goods and move it further along to prevent leaving it far behind.\n\nWhen the Transport and Player inventories are full the Player uses the expanding structure of Paths/Roads/Rails to deliver Goods across the Empire. The Price for certain Goods is based on the Demand of each City. The Demand varies depending on the Region, Values of the citizens and Supply of that specific City. So the Player will have to discover the Demand of each City and provide Goods that match those Demands without increasing the Supply so much that the Demand and Price decrease.\n\nThe Player uses earned Wealth to purchase new Transports and Establishments. New Transports increase storage capacity significantly as well as their travel speed on Roads. Certain Transports also enable the Player to setup a temporary Shop at various Outposts scattered between Cities, and endgame Transports expand on this. Establishments provide bonuses to your Home Settlement in the form of passive Wealth accumulation, passive Goods accumulation, and unlocking new Progression tiers. When the Player has invested a certain amount of Wealth into their Home Settlement the Empire will invite them to join the Railroad network, which allows the Player to purchase a Railroad Station Establishment for their Home Settlement and unlocks access to Purchase Railroad Transports.\n\nThis Railroad connection would signify the conclusion to the main storyline of helping your Home Settlement rise up to become a thriving City with a safe connection to the peaceful Empire, with the Player elected as the City's leader, and subsequently making you an Advisor to the Emperor. Gameplay described from here forward acts as the endgame content and focuses on further expanding your Home Settlement to increase passive Wealth accumulation, as well as investing Wealth in other Settlements to aide them in creating their own Road and Railroad connections.\n\nUntil this point the Player has been able to purchase Transports that allow them to erect temporary Shops at dedicated Outposts scattered across the Regions. These Outposts have mostly served as a safe haven in the wilds for Players to sell unwanted Goods to other traders, Craft(repair?) equipment and potions, and provide a safe location to save and sleep. With the purchase of the Railroad Station for your Home Settlement the Player now has the ability to purchase a Train, which not only has a massive storage capacity, but it can also be used to erect much larger temporary shops at Outposts and Railroad Stations in Cities. Eventually the Train can be upgraded to create a Traveling Carnival Which can be used to decrease the Supply of Goods in the City it is stationed, as well as produce passive Wealth accumulation.\n\nThe Player will have less direct input over the formation and expansion of the Settlements they invest in (compared to the control in your Home Settlement), but you will still recieve bonuses as the settlement expands. The endgame content revolves around maximizing your Home Settlement and then focusing your attention on investing in all other settlements until they all have a railroad connection. Various Settlement Leaders will give you Quests focused on Establishment expansion and residents of Settlements can also offer sidequests that offer other rewards. There should be a loose story surrounding the endgame content that could be as simple as the Player investing and helping to grow other Settlements to help the Empire prosper, and once that endgame goal is completed a story segment could introduce the election of a new Emperor and the Player's subsequent election as the new Emperor. Then allowing the Player to continue playing, finishing sidequests/collectibles, and perhaps introducing a mini Progression tier in the form of a Throne Room or something like that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 3.Progression Systems\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Player Stats\n\n(Stength,Agility,Intelligence,Wisdom,Charisma,Luck)\n\nModular Increase per Level.\n\nEither individual stats, or by group: Physical, Mental, Social(Str+Agi,Int+Wis,Cha+Luck).\n\nPossibly by group for the first 5/10 points, then individual stats thereafter.\n\nGoing by group for the first 5 you could max all stats by level 45, but have nothing invested in Weapon 			Skills.\n\n		\n\n* Weapon Skills\n\n(Sword+shield,HeavyMelee,Polearm,LightRanged,HeavyRanged,Throwable)\n\nModular Increase per Level.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Player Transport\n\n(Handcart&gt;MuledrawnCart&gt;HorsedrawnWagon&gt;RailroadHandcar&gt;SteamWagon&gt;Train)\n\nEach Transport has Craftable Upgrades, Each Transport must be purchased using Wealth(except handcart).\n\nUnlocking of Railroad tied to Home Settlement Progression.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Home Settlement Establishments\n\n(HuntingLodge,MiningUnion,Bazaar,Farm,Blacksmith,AlchemyLab,ArcaneInstitute,RailroadStation,+++)\n\nEstablishments must be purchased using Wealth.\n\nEstablishments can be assigned a Transport.\n\nEstablishment effectiveness is increased by the assigned Transport and upgrades to both the Establishment and the Transport assigned to it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# 4.Physics, Movement and Combat\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe physics wouldn't need to be too advanced, but it should control like a solid 3rd person game with movement that could allow platforming while exploring or hunting for treasures. So walking, running, jumping, and swimming should all be tight and responsive at a bare minimum. I don't see a need to include much environmental physics beyond vegetation movement, water reaction, the ability to smash certain crates/barrels/jugs to loot goods. I'm not a programmer or anything, so maybe the physics I have described advanced, but I'm not envisioning crumbling buildings or destructible environments.\n\nCombat is an area that I'm open to explore. My intial thought was action-based combat similar to Outward, but maybe a bit more Zelda-like, something with combo-based attacks combining light and heavy strikes in various patterns. I do like the impact that weight has on you in Outward though, and since much of my idea revolves around moving Goods it seems appropriate that you should think about the weight you're currently carrying before diving into a battle or chasing down a hunted creature. On the other hand JRPG-style turn-based can allow for some very cinematic combat encounters, and in regards to the Player leveling up, choosing to upgrade a Weapon Skill and having that result in a new attack animation rather than just an effectiveness boost is much more enticing from a progression standpoint."

There is also a leveling system in where each time you level up you can upgrade something or get something new like a jetpack. The more missions you do the more likely of a chance you will encounter bounty hunters who will want your head, There will also be a few highly trained bounty hunters who will appear as bosses.

You find out that the head of the Romans slaughtered your family and are planning a vengeance campaign, but you have no friends or people to help you, so you have to do side quests to save slaves and hire simple boys.  you have to train your people they can level up you can also hire them to do gladiator fights or to look for food and rust as well as weapons only there is the danger that they could not come back and fail, if you have enough people you seize Roman posts  a so that you can make it yours.  you need gold to make it a training camp or a simple camp for your armor and weapons there is also the danger that you have no people at the respective posts who are well trained you lose them because on some days Romans come to look  if everything is ok, should someone survive, he alerts the Romans.  Your goal is to bring down individual Romans with high rank and to grant freedom to the slaves as well as Rome. Sry for my bad english"
ioqyjv,A Dark Metroidvania and Creatures With Human Obsession,"So I was just drawing some sketches because I was bored in class, then I drew this baby-like face without eyes and a nose, basically just a mouth with a grin, the thing also had a spider body with little hands at the end of each leg. Then I thought of a concept for a world, and here are some of the ideas I had.\n\nFirst of all, I imagined the game to be a Metroidvania with a dark atmosphere. When I'm saying dark, I mean Diablo II dark. The world would have mostly villages, with minimal dungeons and cells. The protagonist (haven't thought of a name yet) comes to this isolated place with lots of villages and forests with different settings. Haven't finished sketching so I won't post any drawings but the protagonist looks like a normal knight. Nothing too cool and out of place in the armor, but he/she looks like a human being. Every other model has some flaws. Some of them don't have eyes, some of them don't have a mouth, some of them don't have their face at all... You get the idea, they are all physically imperfect. I won't go into much detail since I don't know how much attention this will get.\n\nThe protagonist comes to a little town that looks empty and after walking a little the small baby-like creature appears. First, it's busy with something when you try to initiate a conversation, after a few tries it turns around to look at you. The thing is shocked and talks about how perfect the protagonist looks. It keeps praising you, kind of like the ring and Gollum but it has decent speaking skills. This little guy will be the helper throughout the journey; help you level up, sell you weapons, armor, and consumables. The little thing explains some stuff about the place for you.\n\nThe world is filled with imperfect creatures and they are mostly at peace. No crime, no discrimination, a perfect society... But every once in a while a human being with all the physical capabilities appears. The word gets around all the towns and they want to see the human, look at his/her beauty. Basically the humans are like Gods to them. Because they love humans so much, they want to be like them. So the whole plot is you have to go through all these little towns filled with creatures to keep on traveling, but all of those things want a piece from you. Some want your eyes, some want arms and legs...\n\nI've got some story elements, a couple of endings, sketches of armor, weapons, enemies, and bosses. If anyone likes the concept (I know I didn't give much to like), I can work on the sketches a little and post them."
ioqpd3,Game where you play as a hero that cannot kill,"I got inspired by batman who says he wouldn't kill anyone and that made me think of a game where you are a hero that doesn't kill similar to the batman but not killing people is very hard.\n\nBasically, you can scan the enemies to see their stats in order to avoid leading to their deaths. Such as having heart issues which means you need to be careful of jumping on them or tazing them and people with a bad digestive system which means you shouldn't poison them and allergies and etc. \n\nSeemed like an interesting idea that popped on my head. What do you guys think?"
ioov76,"Cyberpunk MMO 2D shooter, Enter the gunegon style.",
iohfue,"A game like ""Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes"" BUT in a spacecraft","This popped in my head just now but I haven't gathered all the details just yet but hear me out, so as the title suggests a game almost identical to ""Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes"" however the roles of the two players would consist of one player stuck inside a deteriorating spacecraft and the other player placed in a mission control type location where he has access to telemetry, spacecraft information and most importantly the spacecraft manual and other survival handbooks tailored for the mission. The two players communicate through fuzzy old radios and push to talk buttons and the player playing as ""Houston"" will help the pilot to make his way home from somewhere far lets say the moon and also help him keep his spacecraft from exploding into hundreds of pieces from making mistakes on his journey home. In the game ""Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes"" the bomb has quirky gadgets and wires that need to be solved to disarm the bomb, so for this game idea the spacecraft would have instrumentation and different kinds of deceptive equipment for the pilot to solve with the help of mission control (the second player) since they are the one with the spacecraft manual, and also yes I assume you would also want the spacecraft to procedurally generate a new panel every game just like ""KTANE"" does. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhy I personally think this idea works and innovates on Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes\n\n\- This game would allow you to play with strangers due to the in-game radio feature, no need to have friends.\n\n\- Everything is placed in-game no need to have the manual on some other website, the player in mission control has access to all the information he needs right there in the game to help the player on the other side.\n\n\- Again, the game is co-op so both players are actually playing together and abandons the KTANE way of having the manual reading player to be outside the game and not as immersed as the other player, both can experience some excitement and feedback from the game.\n\n\- Allows for a very large range of scenarios and perhaps game modes, for example the pilot would be following the instructions from player 2 and might have a cockpit fire that he needs to put out before he burns up or maybe a switch that he flicked came out of its socket and is now floating in the cabin so he has to place it back where it came from to use it again. This is the equivalent of having the loud alarm go off randomly in KTANE and the player needs to hit the snooze button.\n\n\- More creative gameplay features like needing to ask mission control what the best space beverage is to drink to keep yourself awake based on randomly generated pilot information like blood type maybe? i'm not sure if that even makes sense but that's an unfinished thought, or asking mission control to give you info on how you should ration your food for the duration of the mission so you don't die of starvation, thirst or energy before you even get back to earth orbit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow I imagine a series of events happening some time in the game perhaps already deep in the mission and assuming the funniest worst case scenario.\n\n\- Pilot running low on energy and mission control asks him to save the final beverages for emergencies only as mission control is able to see that his body reads healthy on his monitors and can possibly survive without the beverages for a while.\n\n\- Pilot now getting drowsy and the player finds it hard to complete basic tasks and read lettering on the panel, maybe a small mini game every once in a while to keep the pilot awake? if he falls asleep the mission is a failure.\n\n\- Critical instrument like an oxygen gauge breaks due to engine vibration after a critical engine task is done and the pilot now needs to either constantly ask mission control for that information that the gauge once displayed or take time to put the gauge back in it's place or fix it or whatever.\n\n\- Like I said this is a deteriorating spacecraft so maybe along the way the spacecraft systems go haywire and thinks there is an unauthorized user so with the help of mission control some mini games have to be completed to unlock the spacecraft again.\n\nI hope you can see where i'm going with this, let me know if you guys think this works or would change some things or the whole thing entirely ;)"
ioda3y,A multiplayer game where the base wealth of the game is relatively finite.,"This is a relatively undeveloped idea so keep it in mind while reading/considering it. I have a business background with a game making hobby so I am coming at this from an economics view point.\n\nMost MMOs suffer from inflation because nearly everything a player does generates wealth from nothing. There are several methods MMO developers use to counter this that I will list just so you know my thought process on my idea.\n\n1. There are items that can not be made by skills that players really want. Essential buff items and other highly used items. These are bought only from an NPC of some sort and that wealth goes into the either.\n2. Untradeable items. These can only be sold for very little to NPCs, they allow the reward of a higher value item to a player without actually generating that higher value in the economy because 'scrapping' it or selling it to an NPC gives only a fraction of the value back.\n3. Fees that send wealth into the ether. Fast travel fees, market posting fees, 'taxes' on guilds, cosmetic change fees, repair fees; all of these are designed to siphon wealth out of the economy.\n\nThere's other ways too but those three are big ones used by nearly every MMO.\n\nMy specific idea is that all 'base wealth' is finite. The system would need to be setup in a tiered system to work, but ultimately it would work like this.\n\n1. Killing non-human things never rewards currency, only items. These items can be sold to NPCs or other players. There is a hidden and fixed unit (read currency) assigned to each item.\n2. When an item is to be spawned a few checks happen. The first is the server checks to see if there is enough 'wealth' in the pool to be used. The second is the 'pools' are setup around each type of drop. So any NPC that when killed has a chance to drop 'item A' looks into the pool for item A to determine if it can spawn said item.\n3. This step is essential, pool sizes for each item are increased per the population of the game server. So, take something like 'wolf teeth', you don't want a permanently fixed pool size of wolf teeth and then have your game flooded with people who can't find any. But that's also a very non-valuable item so for every player that joins, you increase the pool size by say 10. That means there can be a total of 10x more wolf teeth in circulation than players at any given time. Rarer items will get smaller boosts to pool sizes. This can go below 1 per player as well for very rare/legendary/whatever items as well.\n4. These rules only count for base dropped items. Creating an item with a skill that consumes base drop items does not look at a 'pool'. So if you can combine item A and item B to create item C, item C is always created, there's no 'pool' to look for.\n5. When an item is destroyed or consumed it is returned to the 'pool' it came from, this includes selling it to an NPC, dropping/destroying it, consuming it, using it in crafting to make something better, etc..\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust an idea I had floating in my head I thought I'd release into the wild. Have fun twisting it around for potential uses!"

io86cg,Goosebumps VR More steered toward adults,A Goosebumps VR experience with revamped versions of the books for a more Adult audience. The antagonist would be R.L Stine as he plots to show that he is truly the master of fright by showing you a more nightmarish version of his creations. The player would go from book to book much like the Dark picture games go from story to story. In the end you learn that Stine is not the real villain but instead the villain is his army of creatures as he and the player realize that they are trapped and must battle through his creations one by one until they finally escape from a seemingly endless hell of their own making.

io2okd,AR platformer you play in the car,"I read a post about how we used to imagine ourselves running on buildings while in the car, thought it could be a cool idea for a game.

iny3w2,Mother of Nature: A wilderness survival game where you play as a woman who is cursed with a permanent pregnancy. (Very slight nsfw),"The game plays as something along the lines of The Forest or Grounded, but the main difference lies within who you play as. The game starts with a cutscene where you follow a woman who is stranded in a jungle. After being dehydrated for a few days, you accidentally drink of the elusive ""Fountain of Fertility"" and pass out, waking up 24 hours later with a swollen belly and morning sickness. Can you make do and find a way to civilization? Or will this fate be the end of you?\n\nNow you may be asking, why not just have her be normally pregnant? Two reasons. First, natural pregnancy has an end. You give birth, and about 4-5 days later, you are pretty recovered. This doesn't make much sense from a game design standpoint. If i took this route, when the game progresses, it gets more and more difficult then suddenly gets much easier. This isn't necessarily good game design. Second, I want difficulty settings. I have a cool idea where the difficulty is which pregnancy state you are in, Easy being 3 months, Medium being 5 months, Hard being 7 months, and Good Luck! being 9 months. The Fountain of Fertility works where you are trapped in a certain trimester of pregnancy, you don't naturally progress.\n\nBeing a survival game, you would have to do things like craft shelter, harvest materials, and make fire like normal, but doing things like hunting, traversing the environment, having enough food, getting enough sleep, overcoming your new body, and staying not sick would be extra challenges. You could craft things like a extra supportive bra, nausea healing herbal salves, extra pillows for better sleep, etc. You would also be very lucky to find skin cream, or nausea pills, but those are rare.\n\nI would live to see your input and ideas for this! Especially if you have experience being pregnant or have known someone who was."

inxnni,A tactical first person shooter with a horror twist,You would play as either some sort of swat or soldier who needs to do different missions. However instead of being a typical action game I want it to be more of a horror game that shows how frightening the situations would be in real life. The game would have a dark gritty realistic style to it and it would make you feel bad for certain decisions you make such as killing a mentally ill person who was threatening to kill his wife and himself. The game would make you feel bad for killing enemies rather than feeling rewarded. I also like the idea of there being a main character that has ptsd and having psychological moments in the game regarding his ptsd.

inr9m4,Fantasy FPS Perfect Playthrough win only!,"A fantasy-themed First Person Shooter, but which is no RPG but super annoying to master. \n\nYou start in the middle of a round shaped area that has 10 portals, each bringing you to a different themed world. These worlds are not physcally connected, which means you can only enter them through their one portal to the hub world, but are somehow mechanically connected. There are sometimes switches and little puzzles that trigger doors and stuff in the other maps. You will meet classic fantasy-themed, easy-defeatable monsters and will find 3-4 different weapons thoughout the game to beat them.\n\nHere is the clue:\n\nSo, the main goal is to find a book and bring it savely back to the hub, you have no idea in which map it is and how to get there. For this mission you have 1 hour! When a monster hits you once...you DIE! and have to restart the whole game again. One more thing..you play an undead and have to ""eat"" life from the monsters you killed, 2 minutes without a kill will let you die too!\n\nIN fact you have to perfectly know the way, perfectly fight the monsters, not forget to kill from time to time, and do it all fast to finally beat the game. Once done, you will face the only boss fight which could be beaten at first try if you are lucky and that ends the game!"
inq1ip,A game of long time friendship and enemies,"Most games have online systems in which you meet people on COMs and talk to them for the 30 minutes you play for. But what if there was a game in which you are set up with a random player (or players) and face off against other random players, all of which you can converse with through the game. The game would most likely have to be at least partly strategy based to promote long time play of 1 game, and would also need an active ban report watch to avoid trolls dominating play. My hope would be to have 1 game last as long as a week so that a friendship can blossom between the teammates. Maybe the goal could be to eliminate the enemy through an army? So, with that logic there could be maps that differ in terrain that promote adaptive gameplay and strategy making. Assuming the game is army based, you can also change the theme for more diversity as well, with ideas such as: Space, Alien Planets, Earth, Ocean, maybe even Cross Continental. There would need to be a resource system and a wait for certain actions.\n\nSo in short, my goal is to make bonds through common goals and have the game last long enough to let the players get comfortable with each others.\n\nP.s. The idea is totally open so please leave ideas in the comments and feel free to try and make the game, no questions asked."
inngni,Pawn Shop Tycoon,"You start with a small plot of land, buy a cash register, a desk, shelves, etc.\n\nYou then start with $5000 to buy a range of items you think you can sell for higher prices.\n\nCustomers come into the store to either buy or sell. And instead of just having the option to accept or decline an item, you get the ability to inspect each item, look for any dents, damages, if it's real or fake. Kind of like how you inspect documents in papers please. \n\nExcept here you can ask the customer about the problem with the item, they give you their response, they name a price, and then you come to the conclusion of what will be the best price to try and sale at. \n\nYou get certain dialogue options when buying or selling items, and if you carefully pick your words you can convince them to sell at a better price, choose what price to sell items at. etc\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut be careful not to go too low on your off, if a customer feels the price isn't worth the item they will leave with the item and make no deal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou also have to manage logistics, security, your staff members and so on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIdeally there would be a wide variety of items in game, collectibles, comic books, clothes, arcade machines, signed baseball cards.

inn0gy,Shopping Car,"WHAT'S THE BIG IDEA?\nCar that drives through a grocery store destroying everything in it's path and collecting barcodes all while trying to complete a shopping list for a simple dinner.\n\nBefore you ask, yes I also considered shopping kart but thematically this is supposed to be like a top down adventure game, not a racing game.\n\nSTORY\nSo the story goes that there are these old lazy rich people in town who own too many cars because they are rich. I don't really know that part yet because I don't know how rich people think. Anyway, they're sitting around playing shuffleboard when one of them says something to the effect of ""I'm hungry"". Another one is like ""yeah let's order some of those delivery groceries from the store"" and they do that or whatever. But their butler knows that the grocery store doesn't deliver groceries, never has. So he goes to the garage and is working on stuff, and then you see his text bubble on the garage and he says something wholesome like ""hardy work or worky hard"" once again I don't really know 100%. I'm not a writer. And then you choose your car\n\nGRAPHICS?\nis this a part of normal posts? 8 bit should work just fine.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nSo you go into the garage and choose your car. Most of them are locked, but you get the standard three choices of car between fast, beefy, and an in-betweener. When you choose the car, it just drives itself out of the garage, then you load into the grocery store. The idea is to collect the things on the list before time runs out, but that's not actually the idea. You actually want to crash into and destroy everything in the store because who wouldn't. By crashing into the aisles you will reduce their health and when the aisle health reaches 0, they explode and the car gets covered in barcodes. Fruit and veggie section is easiest, frozen foods are the hardest, something like that. At the end of the trip, you drive towards the register and time slows down as you drift by and all the barcodes you've collected are tallied up and that's your score. And the car says a random line to the dumbfounded clerk like ""No receipt!"" or ""Credit, not debit!"" something typical like that. Oh and the groceries are being paid for by the butler's credit card and you unlock things by increasing his credit score by racking up as ridiculous of a bill as you can. I know that's not how it works but in this world that's how it works. \n\nMECHANICS\nThe faster you go the more damage you do. The heavier you are, the more damage you do. Heavy car has slow acceleration, fast car is lightweight. Maybe special abilities for each car like boost for sports cars or j turn drifts for those cars from FnF Tokyo drift.\n\n\nPlease let me know if I'm missing anything, my cat woke me up at 4 this morning and I am tired"

inlhkh,An Idea for an interesting game,"So I had this idea:\nYou‘re an engineer in a cyberpunk-esque world, and your truck has crashed in the wild.\nYour robot friend is repairing it, but you have to face enemies coming from openings on three sides of the square level. You only have your wrench to defend yorself and the truck. Killed enemys dropp coins though, which you can then use to by basic turrets and shredders. Enemies leave corpses you can through into the shredder to get scrap metal, another „currency“ which you can use to buy morr turrets. Turrets shoot in one direction constantly, and some require ammo which is generated by certain machines, or dropped by some enemies. Here‘s the catch though: you can also get damage from the turret‘s bullets. Scrap metal can also be extracted from your truck, but this gives your robot more to repair. These are just my notes, but I‘m not that talented to do this project. Let me know what you think!"
inl2pk,An MMO or RPG that rewards creativity,"A game that has an elemental system, with 8+ elements (fire, water, earth, wind, light, dark, and life/death), each with over 10 skills. These skills can be combined with up to three skills from different elements, and can be customized even further in its effects by the order of selection. \n\nFor example, combining fire and water to make steam, and then using wind to compress the into a ball. This ""steam bomb"" can have another element shoved into it, like life, to create a bomb that creates a healing mist.\n\nUsing the same elements but in a different order would be something new. Starting with wind and fire would make a jet of flames, adding life next gives it lifesteal, and water last would create a protective bubble around you.\n\nOf course, all elements would have their counters, so you have to predict what the enemy will do. This is all just an idea for gameplay, so please tell me your thoughts."

Gameplay would be of god of war(not the ps4 one),Uncharted, and sekiro(without the hard difficulty) had a baby.In the game you have a melee weapon and a projectile weapon. You start out with a Chainsaw Katana and a five barrel shotgun but you get more weapons as you play the game. There is a leveling system where each time you level up you can either get more health, ammo, or moves with your melee weapon. Enemies will be a mix of romanian folklore monsters and some generic monsters(zombies, witches,skeletons, etc). Each monster will have a weakness that you can use to kill them easier like a vampire could be weak to a garlic bomb and stuff like that. Also in the game you will be able to kill enemies quicker with things in the environment for example you could drown a monster in a toilet or smash its head with a tv. There will be side missions where you can hunt down some special monsters that the people in town have seen, take down some human psycopaths, and more."

ine4dn,"This is another post about my planned horror game, this time I'll try my best to explain and make this longer as well","I have now came with the name for my game; ""The Grim Secrets of White Wing"". Like I  said in the last post, you play as a female anthropomorphic cat journalist, but what breed of cat? A Somali cat. \n\nSince this game has one of those ""animal-people universe"" thing, every character in my game will be an anthropomorphic animal. \n\nNow for the summary of the game; A young-adult Somali cat journalist goes to a place known as ""White Wing Asylum"", the asylum itself was abandoned for 26 years and is rumoured to be haunted by the many patients who died there... or is it really ""haunted""? No matter how dangerous or frightening the place is, it's your goal to find out what really happened to the asylum and uncover the truth. \n\nThe asylum will have 8 zones, and each zone has their own enemy, and each enemy has a unique mechanic. But not everyone in the asylum will try to kill as most of the patients are either dead or harmless in a weird way. Eventually, you'll encounter some characters that will help you out as you go deeper into the asylum. \n\nI want my game's atmosphere to be unsettling as possible but I have to hire music producers when I'm older, since the game provides on stealth, the atmosphere will get intense as enemies are near you. \n\nSince I live in Australia, it will be pretty difficult to find good voice actors/actresses for one known reason; coronavirus. I want myself and other people working for me (when I'm older) to be safe, you guys too. \n\nAs for concept artists, I could draw some simple character designs and commission other concept artists to draw the levels or even redesign my drawings. If you guys can think of a good concept artist, give me a link to their accounts or if you are a concept art, I'd like to see your artwork. \n\nAll that aside, let's get to the enemies and their mechanics; The first enemy you encounter will be a (sorry if I have to say this) anthropomorphic tapeworm, he patrols the first zone like he owns the place, and any noise you make will get his attention. Once he spots you, you probably know what happens next but you can stun him and other enemies, but with what? simple, a fire extinguisher. The enemy will be stunned for a good 15 seconds, giving you enough time to get away. Unfortunately, this is the only way to defend yourself but use it when in need.  \n\nThe next enemies are the mallard duck and the bull terrier. The mallard will have the same AI as the tapeworm, however, the bull terrier aka the mallard duck's ""bodyguard"" is blind, but just because he's blind, doesn't mean you can just get away from him easily, two things attract him; Noise and Touch. \n\nThe next enemies are the grey sisters, they are an elephant, rhino, and hippo. The three will search for you separately and when one of them spots you, the other two will be alerted and instantly know your location. Then there is the sarcastic fringehead, the idea of this guy is to not make direct eye-contact with him or else... if you seen the videos of these fish and know SCP-096, you probably know what happens. Then we have the potoo (if you don't know, it's an actually bird), he behaves like a security camera, when he spots you, he will make loud noises to get the enemies' attention, this enemy won't attack you but will be a huge pain-in-the-ass. \n\nAnd the last enemy we will be talking about are the snapping turtles, yes, there will be more than one of them, both male and female. These enemies actually work as their actual real life animal counterpart; Don't go near them and leave them alone. \n\nLike I said, there will be characters you'll encounter that will help you out; This character will be a raccoon kid, he is mute but he will draw pictures on the wall that depict what the enemies do, he is also shy and will runaway once he sees you. \n\nWell, that's all I got for now. If you have any opinions to share with me, go ahead and comment but just remember I'm 15-years-old, so take easy on me please."

Each car would also have three items that would be randomly selected from when you go over an item panel. I have made six cars so far each with items and stats molded to a certain play style. Each one also has a signature color. There is The Athena, The Fortune, The Anubis, The Virgo, The Grandiose, and The Chaos. If you want to know more about any specific car, please ask!"

Pretty much like no man sky, yes, but with a main history in the fundation universe by isaac asimov. Also think on a ideia of time passing that blend with space travel, so you can visit a same planet but in different time lines, seeing it changind and evolving, with different npcs aswell. With a gameplay with a lot of conversation, variable ends and open world. We need to see some os Isaac Asimov on games!"
in4yfy,"A RPG maker """"'horror"""""" game idea :P","Hi everyone, im a random girl who have so many ideas for games and im planning to make my first in RPG maker, but first i guess i should see if people will like the idea (srry for the bad english,)\n\nThe Idea: The protagonist of the game is an 11-years-old girl named Galina who lives with her parents in a small town in Russia, she has three friends, Diogo, 10 and him dog Semya, Natalya, 8 and Tamara, 16.\n\nThey are like ""Scooby Doo"", they go after mysteries and try to solve them, and this time is not different.\n\nDiogo by accident finds a lost map of a house on the outskirts of the city and everyone decides to go and see what is there. When they arrive at the place they get stuck and the goal turns to discover the mystery and leave, but they hardly expect what that house hides, especially about Galina.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow that I wrote it I saw how bad it got, I think I couldn't get through the idea so sorry ;-;\n\nwell, thanks for reading :D"
in3i73,Looking for an urban legend / creepypasta / good idea that fits my needs for a horror game.,"This week I've been busy looking for a good story for my next horror game.\nI prefer my next game to be based on some sort of urban legend.\nLike the horror game 'Aka Manto', it's based on a Japanese urban legend that takes in a Japense school.\nThe game is build around this urban legend and it really fits the story.\n\nI've been busy looking for other cool urban legends, however I haven't really found one yet, that's why I'm asking for your help guys.\n\nThere are some requirements for the story however:\n- The enemy needs to be a humanoid (female preferred) and needs to be hostile towards humans. (So a bad/violent character that has a reason to attack the player / hold the player hostage.)\n- The story needs to take place in a medium / large sized building (bigger then an average house). (in a school / hospital for example)\nSo a story about a certain humanoid that lives in the wild, isn't applicable.\n- I'm looking for something original, so not your typical nun story.\n- I prefer stories based on urban legends, however any good creepypasta / horror idea is welcome as well!\n\nI'm curious what you guys have in mind, the game is going to be developed for Windows, Android and iOS.\nIf someone here is able to provide me a good story that I will use, he/she will get the game for free."

Hire workers for the company and see the results. I am a beginner to developing games, so not sure how I could make it fun.\nThis idea is kind of based from the papers please kind of games, and game dev tycoon's worker hiring system. Depending on the worker you employ, things may go wrong or right.

Does damage or makes the floor slippery.\n2.The candle head melts over time, and you have to get to next checkpoint before melting and dying.\n3. The candle flame is a long trail that follows the players movement. It blocks enemy projectiles and might kill enemies. Or it might also be deadly to the player?\n\nAny ideas are welcome.

in1c04,Just had a good idea for my Faction system (RTS style AI controller),"So i've been working on my AI controlled faction system. This is meant to be an AI that works like a player, playing an RTS and controlling other AI. \n\nThere are stored supplies and resource generators, and the AI works out what it needs to best survive, with a fairly standard prioity system Water &gt; Food &gt; Shelter (Subject to change etc.). If something gets low, the AI seeks out a resource generator, like a well or farm etc. and tries to claim it, possibly encountering another AIs defences, like a normal RTS.\n\nCurrently, I had the function that causes the AI to work out it's needs and resource generators to produce resources, occur every day. So the AI would only be able to react to stuff that happend after the day had passed.\n\nObviously this isn't going to be how it is in the end, as atm it's almost a turn based game BUT i then realised another possbile way of adding RNG to the AI.\n\n**Make the amount of time it takes before the AI can calculate what it needs to do next, based on some kind of political stats.** This would represent the faction members getting together to decide what to do next. This means some factions might get an advantage over others by constantly trying to claim more areas OR they act at a slower pace and maybe they're expansion is slowed but they have thier units positioned at resource generators for longer, i.e. more defense.\n\nJust a thought and I thought I might share it. \n\n**If anyone is interested**, here's the code I've made for a test framework for how thet AI will interact and make these descions. I'm going to implement combat next but all the basic ideas are in there and the AI correctly works out what I needs next.\n\nLook at the [Faction](https://Faction.java)::calculateNeeds()\n\n[https://github.com/belven/Factions-Test-Framework/tree/master/Factions%20Code%20Test/src/Factions/com](https://github.com/belven/Factions-Test-Framework/tree/master/Factions%20Code%20Test/src/Factions/com)\n\nIf you run the MainApllication file, you'll be able to see an outut of 5 days worth of supplies being used. However, they don't yet fight or claim new territory, so nothing changes from day to day other than lost resources"

imx3zu,Actually unique equipment,"I was thinking for a mechanic of my game about making truly unique weapons and armour. As in there's only 1. Entirely.\n\nPlayers could sacrifice their save game (akin to Nier Automata) to design their own equipment. The more powerful their character, the more powerful and flexible their design can be. The item then drops in someone else's game.\n\nSet items could be created by dividing up the item's power level amongst the items being created.\n\nNaturally there would have to be some balance to stop people hoarding items. Perhaps Unique items take up excessive amounts of inventory space, or are added back to the loot pool if they're unused for a long period of time.\n\nThe real question is, would anyone give up their saves to improve the loot in someone else's game?"

imqx9h,Solo bossfights in good looking environments with loads of different ways of beating it.,"Skip to ‘IDEA’ if you just want the idea!\nAs someone who worked on fairly decent amount of games (nothing done or even near done) because of it being a little u realistic as a solo dev, this seems a possability.\nI like graphics and visuals, doing that with many other mechanics is near impossible unless I have alot of time which I don’t, so this seesm realistic.\n\nIDEA\n\nA solo third or first person game where you have loadsnof different types of ‘bosses’ to battle.\nYou start in a hub where you progress from a boss to boss, each boss had its own environment, the level design will be realistic and colorful at the same time.\n\nSome types of bosses are like a Tree mutated stump that habits a ‘relatively small to medium’ arena, you are found within a forest type of area with a tree that becomes the boss, you will have to fight it and counter its attacks (it will have alot of different attacks) and it will take time to master it, think Cuphead difficulty.\n\nYou start of with a bad weapon and fight the boss, everytime you beat a boss you get a skillpoint/unlock token to make your character even stronger.\n\nAfter beating a boss, more options will unlock and more tiers for the bossfight.\n\nEach bossfight will have ‘secret’ attacjs hidden for its next better tier so the tree boss will now also heal with an attack by strangil you with leaves and vines, something like that.\n\nEvery boss will he designed to last lokg and be difficult wnd the higher you go the more difficult it gets, even with the upgrades you get throughout the game.\n\nSome bosses will have puzzles, a Toxicated Frog/ww1 masked boss will jump from the arena and you will have to figure out specific valves to turn around the arena, with a timer, every few seconds it will spill a toxic barrel that will drop down toxic which will damage you when you stand on it, the worse you act on this small puzzle the harder the next boss encounter will be (will be difficult to attack a fast moving boss when there is toxic around the arena) \n\nYour choices and skill will lead the battle to be easier, or harder.\n\nSome idea’s I currently have with bossfights are as follows,\n\nA kaprosuchus in a swamp where you have to stand on large lily pads, a Giant frogsquid like that creature with huge tentacles (yes, underwater fights will happen too) to creatures in mars, and other planets/galaxies.\n\nWhy I think this is more realistic for menis because the level design is more ‘small’ and compact so I can give 110% on level design and actually make it look beautiful without feeling like having To design a whole level (horror game) \n\nAnd bosses itself, I love concept art and making creatures and am not scared to master animating and effects!"

imoi78,A decent idea for all consoles.,"So I just joined this reddit to say one thing and know someones probably said it already (as of rn). BUT ANYWAY I know a lot of players on pc say stuff like ""Well console can't have a realistic shooter game because there isn't enough keys or buttons on a controller."" But what if (and i mean for any console) they just made a game like the Arma games, or just a transition to console, where it requires you to have a keyboard? Like obviously that'd sound ridiculous, but I think it is a great idea. And say for the requirements on the back, or in bold ""REQUIRES KEYBOARD AND MOUSE.""

imlp6j,"A game where you have to kill multiple different people through each level, but you have to make sure you are mentally sane.","There’s two parts of the game, the parts where you are not doing a mission and can do anything you want. Some things you do can help in missions. You can go to therapy which makes your mental state get affected less, you can buy drugs which when taken can stop your mental state from changing for a bit, etc. Then there is missions. You have to kill multiple different targets which you have to explore the area they were last seen in to find them. Every kill affects the mental state badly. You can take a little break which helps the mental state but cuts off some time. The first level of your mental state is normal and has no effects. Second makes it a bit harder to kill because your character stops to think about it, but it gives a damage boost. The third makes your character kill the person immediately with no thought which makes him faster, but he also has less accuracy, and after he kills he cries about what he did. The final makes your character insta-kill but its a 50% chance it will actually hit, if it doesn’t hit, your character is so deranged he hallucinates he killed him in the most brutal way possible, when in reality he passed out and let that target get away. If on easy, he can catch up with the target, if on intermediate, the target escaped and he finishes this level with that target not eliminated, and on hard he fails the mission and has to retry. You can buy different weapons with different perks and special abilities. Only guns in the game are silenced handguns."

imjlt1,The Factory: A first-person horror/escape/detective game taking place in Willy Wonkas failed Chocolate factory,"A year after Charlie was awarded with the chocolate factory and Wonka had shed his responsibilities, Charlie discovers the true reason he was so willing to bestow such a prominent empire upon a child(unknown to us). In addition to the financial expertise needed to run such a place, charlie discovers that there are dark secrets that have been fought back for decades and have become more and more difficult to contain.\n\n\nNeedless to say, the factory quickly plummets in sales, production comes to a halt, and Wonka mysteriously became a forgotten name. Even the bravest investor declined to inherit the once-thriving throne due to its sudden and ominous failure. Those who ran the factory, or even had the opportunity to see inside, have all since vanished without a trace. None have really cared or been brave enough to even investigate until now, ~5-10 years later.\n\n\n| Introduction |\n\n\n(This is where the variation in protagonist comes into play)\nA candy enthusiast/journalist/concerned relative of charlie/private investigator hired by an unknown figure, learns about this curious case, and decides to delve more into it than anyone ever has. There is no contact, partner, or passerby in the city willing to aid in his/her trip to the now abandoned and decaying factory because of its infamy, and therefore [Protagonist] must gather his/her wits and resources and go it alone. \n\n\nYou arrive in the city, much sunnier and cheerful than we remember. There are people, cars, prosperity everywhere. As you navigate the town, every cheerful person you ask about the factory immediately turns their head and keeps walking as their bright, welcoming smile fades and they coyly tell you they would rather not speak, but still tell you to have a wonderful day. \n\n\nYou internally monologue about how strange everyone seems, and decide to stop by the old Bucket house before you head to the factory in search of primary clues. You reach the outskirts and even though its still sunny outside, the tone changes to gloomy as you arrive upon the house and see what remains is only the shared bed, two standing walls, and withering junk remains. A poorly written note from Charlie amongst the rubble to the about fleeting investors and how he hates his life after this change, as well as how he doesnt know how to uphold so much emotional burden leaves you with your first trail of clues and further motivates you to head to the factory. \n\n\nYou arrive at the factory and behind the padlocked gate, through the dramatic, slow walk to the entry, you make your way into the familiar first room. It looks surprisingly well kept and nothing yet seems off. Over a PA system, you hear an automated recording of Wonka for the first time and in his typical quirky tone he welcomes you:\n\n\nWonka: *Whispers* How do I do this? Just talk? \n\n\nOompa loompa: *murmurs*\n\n\nWonka:  ""okay...""*clears throat*""HELLO, WHAT A FINE DAY! You, sir or ma'am are one of our first lucky guests to begin the visitor tour trial phases! Consider this the high point in your life as you will experience something *bzzz, skip* the most seasoned tourist has yet to notch on their belt. Prepare yourself as...*skips*\n\n\n""...How many takes is this now? Our guests wont notice if I use one blasted curse word, dammit!""\n\n\n""*Sigh* Alright, we still have to get this tour intro down, don't mind this sir or madam, and go on through the door. Adventure awaits!""\n\n\n| End |\n\n\n\n Of course, this is only something that was in the works while wonka was in charge, so it doesn't go much beyond that and along with little snippets of wonka dialogue, this is mainly to give the player a sense of creepy presence.\n\n\nThe true horror would come from potential accidents from the environment (including the ones that killed our previous guests, violet, augustus, etc.), things moving that shouldn't, and evil, deranged oopma loompas lurking in the unknown. Revisit all the famous attractions that we remember with a dark twist, all while you are trying to solve what events lead to the downfall of the factory. \n\nIm not sure if weapons would be necessary, or if it would be an outlast-type horror, but the degradation into insanity and turmoil as you descend into the lair would set an amazing environment for ""nostalgia gone bad"" horror."
imjhok,A Leprechaun game where you really earn real money,"We’ve all heard of those apps which claim that you can earn real money by playing, but they turn out to be little more than scams.  In some cases, you reach a certain point in the game and you earn nothing.  In other cases, you need $100 to cash out, but you never make it past the low 90’s.  Sometimes you’re gambling, and the odds are against you.  My idea is straightforward:\n\nThe hypothetical name of the game is Leprechauns &amp; Liches.  You play the role of a male or female Leprechaun with adjustable physical appearances (hair color, eye color, skin color, etc).  You travel through the land battling skeletal liches and other undead, and you can be a warrior, archer, or mage. At the end of each mini stage, you see a rainbow with a pot of gold at it’s base, and when you click on the pot of gold, you watch an ad.  You can also watch ads to upgrade your hit points or your weapon (sword, bow, or magic wand), which allows you to complete stages faster.\n\nGame developers make money each time you watch one of the ads in their game. In this game, you would be guaranteed to earn a certain percentage of the money generated from watching the ad, which would then go straight to your PayPal account.  You would earn money slowly, but at least you would be guaranteed a portion of the profit that you help the game developers earn."

imip8p,"Multiplayer Horror based off of ""Do you copy""","I had this idea while in the shower, and i thought about it for a while, and i wanted to throw it somewhere.\n\nThis game would be a multiplayer horror based off the small indie known as ""Do you Copy"". The idea is, every round, 8 players would randomly be given a ""class"". These classes include, the monster, park rangers, and hikers. Ill just start with them because this could get sorta complicated.\n\n2 Park Rangers spawn in 2 different towers, and there are 4 of them. 2 are empty, and 2 have rangers in them. The rangers don't know what tower they are in, and what tower the other ranger is in. The only way to know is surroundings, but even thst could be misleading. They spawn with a radio, flashlight, rifle, and flare gun. Radio is a simple pocket radio for communication outside the tower. The flashlight does exactly what you would think it would do. The rifle is for shooting stuff, however, shooting the monster does not kill it or hurt it, it just stuns it. The rifle is very loud, so dont use it often or you might attract unwanted attention. Flare gun is just for situations where you might need to show where you are to the other ranger if you wander off and find the hikers. The job of the Park Rangers is to save as many hikers as possible, and guide them to safety.\nThis is primarily done with the radio inside your tower, which uses electricity, but I'll talk about that later. The radio uses voice chat and has less range then the tower radio. you can also use text based chat if you dont have a mic. Just to add some spook, whenever someone is talking, you can't see WHO is talking. You have to recognize their voice. Same goes with text chat, but with words. Another thing park rangers can do is turn on the floodlights, it will show the hikers where you are, but also the monster. The goal is to lead the hikers to an empty tower, and not yours or the other rangers. Its fine if you do, but that will likely lead the monster to you and everyone could die, resulting in the monster winning. You can also shut off the lights to hide easier, or to make it look like and empty tower so the monster doesnt find you. The park rangers tower uses electricity (radio, floodlights, lighting) which comes from the generator. Each tower has a generator. The park rangers will sometimes have to leave the tower to refill the generator. The monster can also shut off or straight up destroy them, the latter taking more time and making noise. The park ranger can leave to go find the hikers or help them, or to go to a new tower. You can lock doors, and there are 2 exits from the tower. Stairs, and a second door down to the gasoline room for the generators. If the hikers escape they win. If the hikers die and they survive, its a stalemate. Same other way around.\n\n\nHikers spawn in different campsites scattered throughout the map. They all start with a flashlight and radio. They can find weapons around the map. Their goal is to stay alive and get to a tower. They can communicate with the rangers via radio, and have a flashlight for visual reasons. Not much to say here, other than they just need to escape. If they escape, they win.\n\n\n\nThe Monster spawns in a random place far away from the park rangers and hikers. To elaborate the park rangers spawn in the top right of the map, the Hikers spawn anywhere in the bottom left to bottom right, and the monster spawns anywhere from the top Left to middle. The monster has a few abilities, one is just a basic punch/claw attack, that 2 shots the hikers and 3 shots park rangers. It one shots bears and wolves. Next is the dash attack, which one shots everything. And finally his radio ability. He can talk in the radio channels to mimic voices and speak himself. This is used to confuse park rangers and hikers, and also spook the fuck out of people. Or you could use it to rick roll people, i dunno. His only objective is to KILL. If he kills everyone, he wins.\n\n\nThe only AI creatures i wanted to implement are bears and wolves, which are just there to spice things up a bit. Bears are freaked out by noise, and will run from it, but are much more dangerous then wolves. Wolves, on the other hand, travel in packs of 3, and are attracted by noise. Bears 2 shot, wolves 4 shot. Since they travel in groups, i thought this would be fair.\n\n\nWeapons would be Hunting bows, revolvers, rifles, and crossbow. Hunting bow is the most common, and only stuns the monster for about 3 seconds. It makes no noise and kills bears in 3 hits, wolves in 2.\nNext is the revolver. It is common enough that its not too hard to find, but its harder to find than the bow. Bullets are more scarce. It makes alot of noise, and may attract wolves. It can be used to scare away bears, 1 shots wolves, and 2 shots a bear. Stuns the monster for 5 seconds. Next is the rifle, the park rangers spawn with this. It does the most damage, and stuns for the longest. It makes the most noise out of any weapon. It stuns the monster for 10 seconds, and slows him down a little. It only spawns with park rangers, and has 3 shots. After those 3, no other bullets can be found. Next is the crossbow. Is does a little less damage then the rifle, and is silent. It stuns the monster for 7 seconds, and 1 shots wolves. bears are 2 shots. Ammo is recoverable, but you only have 3 arrows. 2 of these spawn every round, and are the rarest weapon in the game.\n\n\nThis is just a cool idea i had, and if anyone has suggestions it would be appreciated, i would love to work on something like this once i get a good pc."
imh72t,An Article On Creating Solid Game Concepts,
imh2ac,My Dream PvP/PvE light mmo would make players monsters upon death and make the camera part of the gameplay.,"To start, I'm a big fan of rpgs with great exploration, a variety of skills, and interesting quests. I think all of these facets are essential to a good mmo, but they are not worth mentioning as a unique selling point. Consider those facets a necessity to highlight the proposed selling points. Consider these selling points on top of a normal rpg with AI monsters and quests. \n\nSelling Point 1: \n**Combining PvP and PvE with character death:**\n\n- All players are in the same faction while alive and playing their main characters. They can challenge other players to 'duels' but not openly attack other main characters.\n- Upon character death, there is a chance (1/10?) that the character has been corrupted, and instead of respawning with the death penalty you respawn as a low-ranking monster from one of several factions with unique skills.\n- As a monster a player can attack other players and good npcs and try to accomplish monster quests.\n- As a monster kills more good NPCs and players and accomplishes monster quests, they can rank up and select from new monster forms.\n- Ranking up also provides ""monster lives"" allowing the monster to choose to respawn as a monster again up to the number of lives they have.\n- When a monster dies, the player can respawn back as their main character. The higher rank and more monster lives they had before they respawned the less the death penalty affects them, eventually turning it into a death boon. Being a good monster rewards the player.\n- Monster quests also reward a unique currency based on that monster's faction, which players can use on their main character to get ingame items, unlock unique skills, and buy temporary buffs/pets. Again, being a good monster rewards the player.\n- High ranking monsters can choose what quests low ranking monsters can choose from. When enough quests are achieved new ones will open up, eventually allowing the high-ranked monster to choose quests that will affect the map (attack this city, kill the NPC king of this city, bury these ruins, corrupt this NPC, etc).\n- Some high ranking monsters can control mobs and direct them to other places on the map to help accomplish quests. Some monsters might be warriors while others are stealth focused. Higher level ranks get more specialized monsters.\n\nRational:\n- Player death can't guarantee spawning as a monster since then players will purposefully die. Turning into a monster needs to feel like an opportunity to be selfish (I can get good stuff, even if it hurts living characters).\n- Player characters shouldn't want monsters succeeding at their quests since they will lose access to valuable resources and buffs. (reason for conflict)\n- Being a monster should reward players for being selfish.\n- Playing vs AI can get redundant, but the threat of player monsters changes things. It creates natural quests (find the monster who's been hunting down NPCs, find the monster forcing mobs to attack the mines, etc). It makes natural exploration riskier, since a player monster might interfere. It also gives a reason for players to naturally band together (when alive) and an excuse to grief (when a monster). On the other hand, 100% pvp removes the risk and intrigue (you know there is a player trying to get you, instead of just wondering if there is).\n\nSelling Point 2:\n**Make the camera a part of the gameplay**\n\n- Requires action combat with aimed attacks*\n- Players have access to a ""camera"" inventory slot which can be upgraded depending on the camera.\n- First Person Camera - Default/Empty (if your camera was destroyed), or goggles/lens. Upgrades/Benefits could include: Zoom (for sniping), cannot be damaged (no risk of changing camera views in a fight), easier to target body parts with attacks (similar to Vermintide 2, if you aim at and hit the head of a monster, you deal more damage).\n- Third Person Camera - A floating orb a few feet/meters behind the character allows them to be controlled from third person. Natural benefit of a better view and easier jump puzzles, natural drawback of not being able to aim melee attacks at specific body parts. Can be damaged and destroyed by enemies (particularly monsters). Upgrades: increased defense, near-invisibility\n- Tactical Camera (Eye in the sky): A floating orb that can raise high into the sky. Natural benefit for scouting and tacticians. Easier to cast long range AOE abilities. Risk: can be sniped out of the sky and harder to control/move your own character.\n\nRational:\n- Having a destructible camera adds another level of tactics into a game, especially with pvp. It also allows for players to enjoy a wider variety of ways to play the game. For example, when combined with the Monster idea above, this means players could be exploring a cavern and a monster could attack their cameras first, restricting their view before engaging. Wars would involve mages raining fire onto the battlefield as snipers try to find and destroy their cameras. Rogues might use a third person camera to sneak around corners and dodge attacks, while a warrior might stride into battle without a camera to bash skulls in."
imedsv,A free turn-based tile-based infinite dungeon crawler for mobile.,"Free idea no strings attached.\n\nLong ago, a lesser god of chaos left earth because order had reigned supreme for too long, and it was utterly fed up. It went out into space and started to build from the opposite side orbit around the sun from earth so as to hide from the others.\n\nUsing its mighty powers as a god, it created a block that could absorb the energy from the sun to create more of itself, and eventually to rearrange themselves into ever-shifting rooms and halls and levels. Over the millenia, (as making matter from energy is extremely slow,) it added traps and monsters and treasure.\n\nIt then became bored with its new world, as lesser gods of chaos often do, and it created a portal back to earth, promptly forgetting that any of it had ever existed.\n\n...\n\nHere's where you come in. You're exploring an ancient temple site, when you happen upon a huge distorted room with ancient symbols engraved into every surface. The strange symbols swirl and morph as you stare, glowing and dimming and swapping and merging with each other seemingly at random. You don't realize it right away, but as you look on in awe, the parts of the room that are shrouded in shadow are actively changing around you. Before you know it, you've lost sight of the way out! You cut yourself on something sharp as you stumble around in the darkness, frantically searching for the exit that had once been there. Sobbing, cursing, praying, you become disoriented and lightheaded as you slowly succumb to blood loss. Finally, you reach a heavily engraved stone door and you smear it with blood as you wearily feel around for the handle in the darkness. The carvings glow dimly and the door gives way. You hear unearthly howls in the distance. The door closes with a heavy thud as you slip through the opening. You collapse in relief and exhaustion, thinking that you've finally escaped the strange room, and you drift into an uneasy sleep, unaware that you've been transported far from where you once were.\n\n...\n\nSo basically it's a random (procedurally generated) infinite dungeon with a lot of RPG and roguelike elements in it. Once an element of the dungeon is far enough away, it disappears, and if you go back, you'll find all new elements. You get to decide what your goal is. You have stats and skills and stuff just like a roguelike, with skills leveling up from use, and stats going up from levels and player selection.\n\n...\n\nFor the map, I'm thinking it should be built using a lot of room templates. Hallways would just be a type of room. Have it all kinda put together onto the map haphazardly, like a toddler using a rubber stamp. Have to make sure things connect. Don't want (m)any dead ends. I also like the clutter and doodads in rooms, and being able to push or throw anything you can lift. Sleeping creatures, searchable corpses, randomly dropped items, things in desk drawers, etc, are all opportunities for discovery.\n\nTo preserve immersion between levels, limit the number of staircases spawned in the world to 1. Have the roaming distance be as large as possible, so maybe you wouldn't remember where the stairs were anyways once they are destroyed. Then you'll have to wait until another stairway chamber is randomly generated. Hopefully there could be enough room types so that it doesn't seem too repetitive.\n\n...\n\nI thought that player scaled difficulty was a total disaster in TES, and I don't like how difficult roguelikes are in general. I think difficulty should scale extremely gradually based on your distance from the core of the dungeon. It should be barely noticeable, but, you know, you'll realize that monsters and traps get stronger and deadlier and loot gets better as you move in a certain direction, that is toward the center. It could be made so that negative difficulty prevents anything from being generated, which would mean empty space, like with stars and no air. Maybe a challenge mode could slowly shrink the dungeon so that you have to find a way out, or maybe you could break some important magical system that causes it.\n\n...\n\nIt's a random game, so progression should be pretty random. I like the idea that there might be some non-hostile creatures that you could talk to or even have them join you in a variety of ways. Not like static quest guys, but like, regular monsters just minding their own business. Maybe some eat only mushrooms, one might even ask you if you have one. Unique items would never be totally lost, just have a spawn rule that the maximum number of the item is 1. There could even be scripted moments of deja vu when a destroyed note is found later, or a discarded dagger, or even seeing a familiar monster again.\n\nSo as you explore through the random rooms, you'll find clues to lots off different mysteries. Based on the skills you choose, you may decide to follow the mage's path clues, or the thief's path of clues, etc, clues that would only be useful if you have the necessary expertise or goals. You may even find the ultimate treasure first (and have no idea) and find the clues later, because, random. None of those extremely linear storyline tropes, please. Let's say it wouldn't be out of the question for the first room you wake up in be the portal room that sends you right back to the temple on earth. And while we're at it, we might as well have a randomly appearing game save room. That's not to say you would find any of those things for hours, though.\n\nYeah, that might be enough to fill my desire for an endless dungeon crawling game.\n\nOoh, and the sequel story could be that when you escaped, you tipped off the chaos monsters that there's an exit, and they start invading earth, and you have to seal the portal to stop them. You could also start meeting more and more heroes."
ime9n7,kinda of irrelvent,"as of when i checked, we have 34,567 members on the subreddit"
ime2n9,Key features I want in my game,"I've  done a lot of research and spent a long time writing out all my ideas.  I've gone through 1000s of sticky notes and trello projects trying to  get it all down but until now i've never actually said I want this and  not this.\n\n**Overview of my game, so far (Subject to change etc)**\n\nMy  game is a real time squad-based RPG. You can have 1 – 4 characters in a  squad and you’re in a world with several factions at war, trying to fix  problems (I’ll come up with a main story arch later but it’s somewhat  irrelevant atm). It will feel like a top down MMO with concepts like  tank, healer DPS but each character can use anything you like. You can  also switch to taking control of any character in your squad and an AI  will take other your existing character.\n\nIt’ll  be a somewhat low poly game (I’m not a 3D modeller / artist) with  Sci-fi themes, similar to Cloudpunk I guess but on land. I’ll try and  make something that resembles a functional environment with factory  areas, farming areas, civilian and military etc. The AI will almost be  playing an RTS game against each other, whilst you’re going around  messing things up or siding with some AI etc.\n\n**So here it is, a list of the low level key features of my game:**\n\n1. You need to think about your approach to a situation and can use skills and the environement to achieve your goals\n2. Abilities that can be interrupted and intercepted\n3. AI act regardless of the player\n4. Several factions constantly fighting it out around the player and performing actual tasks that they would if it were real life\n5. One faction could loose permenantly, possibly all but one could remain, without the players influence\n6. You can take direct control of other party members and have AI play your character\n7. AI might end up being much better at the game than the player\n8. You can kind of do nothing and the game carries on without you\n9. Make fights where the AI will have issues without direct command\n10. Make  context-based UI. Options appear filtered both on where / what you  clicked on and what your team can do at that point in time\n11. New  way to symbolise being on low health. The environement changes colour  based on the situation. At low health the games becomes more red and  black and the ratio of red to black shifts towards black, the lower your  health\n12. Exp  is not gained on kill but is gained based on you playing your role.  Dealing damage, healing and taking damage equals exp gain and not  killing something\n13. The enemy’s “difficulty” is based on the level of your skills trees but only the ones you are using\n14. Scaling system\n15. Catch-up system"
imd81x,Avatar Video-game Idea,"Hi all,  \n\n\nThis is an idea that's been brewing in my head for a while; one that has to do with the Avatar series and where it could pick up from in a video-game world.  \n\n\nWhere we left off was Korra pretty much restarting the Avatar cycle, where she is the beginning and the end (kind of a Jesus metaphor there lmao); she is perfectly synced with the spirit of Raava and has sealed Vaatu away.  \n\n\nNow I know this may be a stretch, but I'm going to start my idea by saying this world is based in a more modern era, not exactly the year 2000&gt; with its technology, more along the lines of the early-mid 1900s within the Avatar world, so a little bit past the steampunk technology from TLOK, but not at the point we are right now.  \n\n\nMy idea was that the Avatar would be evil, not a super-villain type who kills everybody without the blink of an eye, but a tormented Avatar who wants to reunite Raava and Vaatu within their body, creating the perfect Avatar who could bend all those to their will; so he would most certainly have conflicting emotions from the beginning, but when reunited with Vaatu, he would go into a crazed, manic state where his potential is limitless.  \n\n\nThe character you play as would be a customizable one picked from any kingdom/tribe and you can decide whether or not you would like to be a bender. When you start your adventure, depending on which area you begin, you will be given a weapon and you can decide on a bending technique that you have mastered.\n\n  \nThe weapons for the different tribes/kingdoms are as follows:\n\n* The Fire Kingdoms - Katana\n* The Earth Kingdoms - Guan Dao\n* The Water Tribes - Mace\n* The Air Temples - Staff\n\nAll weapons relate to their bending and can be used alongside their bending.  \n\n\nAs you travel, you will find friends (NPCs) that can help you along the way; there will also be vendors selling armor, weaponry, scrolls, etc. (Note: All armor, clothing, and weaponry have a certain weight, the more items you carry, the slower you will end up whilst fighting and running).  \n\n\nDuring your adventure, you can choose to go to the other starting areas to learn techniques only available through venturing through the kingdoms/tribes/temples; eg, fire benders must go to the water tribes to learn lightning bending and redirection and water benders must travel to a forbidden water nation temple to learn the art of blood bending.  \n\n\nThere will be many memorable areas to go throughout this open world, you can journey to see the dragons and learn from them, you can go to the secret passageway to Omashu and learn from the badger moles.  \n\n\nAs you gain strength, you will encounter the Avatar multiple times, each of which they are also getting stronger.  \n\n\nThe Avatar will be a middle-aged Earth Kingdom citizen who, due to their Avatar status rises to the top and becomes an almost Phoenix King Ozai figure, although much more sympathetic up until the end. The Avatar has ties to almost everybody and if is opposed will take action.  \n\n\nThe fighting works similarly to the criminally underappreciated fighting videogame Absolver, where you will have multiple stances and a combo deck that you build over time through learning techniques using the people around you and practicing through scrolls.  \n\n\nYou will have 2 separate decks that you can merge together (although you will get more as you level up) the Weapon deck and the bending-only deck, you can swap freely between the 2 during combat, although weapons have draw time and retracting time from their sheathes which can make you vulnerable.  \n\n\nOnce the Avatar is defeated, Vaatu leaves their body in search of destruction and almost finds his way out of the spirit world, when Raava joins you and both you and Raava must defeat Vaatu as the new Avatar.  \n\n\nOnce Vaatu is defeated, you can choose to roam the open world as the Avatar, or have Raava seek a new host in which she can share her power and wisdom. You have an option of choosing to play from the beginning with the New Game+ system, where everybody levels up with you and you keep all of your abilities from the last game (although you cannot keep the Avatar abilities in the New Game+), and you have the choice of restarting anew from another bender or non-benders perspective.  \n\n\nI know this is a long read, but for those who get through this, I hope you enjoy the idea of this (even though it is only an idea); I hope you've had a fantastic day and make sure to drink water!!  \nMaybe if this gets popular, it's an idea that could become a reality.  \n\n\nCheers!"
imc3rp,Car/Boat Horror Game,"In most horror games you are somehow cut off from cars so that you wouldn't escape too fast, but what about the horror game where you drive the car?   \n\n\nYou drive through some shady roads in the forest/abandon fields/working places or just driving on some less used country roads at night and try to escape or just pass unnoticed while beign stalked by some guys in a car or without it. The game would be from first person perspective where you can turn around your head inside the vehicle to add immersion. Beign also avaliable on VR would add some points.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBeign in a car also allows to avoid making some stupid level boundaries as if you would run on foot you can easily run through the tight planted trees, walk through hillock or jump about fences. The game could also be not in a car but in a boat on some kind of long, misty lake."
im9qsm,Ben 10 (classic) with Open World,"Genre: Open World, Action Adventure, Platform, Shooter, Fighting/Beat 'em up, Stealth, Metroidvania/Puzzle and Strategy (loosely though)\n\nSo you start from the very beginning regular Ben , later meeting up with your Grandpa and Cousin, you start wondering around in the forest til you get your Omnitrix, start out as Heatblast etc etc slowly meeting other alien character you get to play as. As for cutscenes will be 3D animated of the Ben 10 show we all watch as we were little. Later on through the story we finally get to be in the “Open World” where there’s side quest and other things to do and gain EXP. \n\nThere’s also leveling system and retracing steps for example each alien would have their own level like Heatblast would be level 8 and Four Arms be level 10 as each one would have their unique mechanics and special skills. Retracing steps would be for collecting collectibles that you wouldn’t be able to get to. Say there’s like a boulder that’s blocking  your way to get the sumo card you can either be: Heatblast, Four arms, Upgrade, Diamond head, Cannonbolt, Blitzwolfer, Frankenstrike, Upchuck etc special aliens that’s strong enough (high level to reach certain skills) to either bash or blast that boulder. Or need to be a certain alien that’s require to reach that area. \n\nSo the Open World would have places you visited on the TV show and other unique areas to cover more ground, it will have other cutscenes that’s not in the episode so we can make sure the gameplay last longer than 4 hours or such. Different difficulties that would of course increase health and attack damage and here’s the strategy comes into play, say your fighting an alien that’s grass of course you’ll go Heatblast OR Diamond head since he can slash it pretty easily. Different aliens would of course have pros and cons against other enemies or areas your in. As for stealth it’s more towards Upgrade, Ghost Freak, Grey Matter or Buzzshock. \n\nI have more ideas if anyone would like to hear them! Or they would like to add something that I may forgotten or didn’t even thought of! Hope to hear feed back you all! :&gt;"
im75wh,"""Superman: Just the Clark Kent stuff.""","[Got the idea from watching this video.](https://youtu.be/rtlFR5SYzYo?t=3573) It's a joke pitch, but I would totally want to buy it. I love games that use the concept of taking everyday activities, and turning them into video games, whether it's for the purpose of creating a chilled simulation style experience, or a deliberately high-stress cringe-comedy game. I think this idea could work great as the latter.\n\nI feel like there's already a game on the tip of my tongue that has a very similar premise to what I'm imagining, but I can't quite name it. Octodad is similar, but I'm thinking that as well as the tasks themselves being difficult to complete (maybe they're all awkward minigames), the overall task of managing your time effectively is stressful and punishing. Sorta like playing The Sims but your Sims' needs meters rise five times as fast. I've not played it, but I think Papers Please would also be a good comparison here in regards to stretching your time and forcing you to make decisions with no easy answer.\n\nThe game *does* give you your powers, but using them is like dark magic in fantasy. Any time you use them other than for fighting in the name of justice (a part of your life which the game completely blueballs you on by either skipping over it, or omitting it completely) it sets up some consequence which bites you back later on. This is especially true if you're not stealthy about using the powers, but even if you are, there's almost always *some* consequence.\n\nThese consequences could include:\n\n- Deranged fans stalking you, becoming envious of your SO and trying to murder them so they can get with you, breaking into your house to be with you, etc. \n\n- Ex-villains or people who disagree with the idea of superheros (a la Incredibles) hatching up plans to kill you or ruin your life, and you've then gotta deal with them somehow, preferably not by using your powers else you'll dig yourself even deeper\n\n- Paparazzi camping outside your house\n\n- Rumours spreading at school which get your kids bullied\n\nMaybe the game even ventures into some pretty dark places, though nothing too severe. The game always keeps a comedic tone, even if it gets almost pitch black at times."
im61zw,Kung Fu game in Mexico where you play as a man with chi abilities trying to stop the Cartel in his town,"This game will have one of those old 80s kung fu movie feel to it. I would imagine the game to be like the arkham games combat wise except you have a chi system and level system. In the game you will have a chi bar which you can use go activate to use chi based attacks.Chi attacks deal alot of damage and is good for crowd control. Everytime you level up you can either increase your health, increase your chi meter, or gain new moves. There will be a variety of enemies who will test your skilll for example there will be enemies who if they hit your pressure point you wont be able to use your chi attacks for a certain amount of time."

itdq60,Transformers: Hero Shooter concept,"If there’s two things in this world that I love dearly it’s the Transformers franchise and Rainbow 6 Siege. My dream video game would see these two properties combine into a true labor of love project: Transformers Warzone.\n\nCore Gameplay Loops: Sieges influence will mostly be from the idea of unique characters with slightly customizable but fairly distinct loadouts or kits. The tactical gameplay wouldn’t compliment the Transformers franchise well, instead more traditional arcade hero shooters like Overwatch. Classic G1 transformers had character bios on their packaging that generally detailed their “stats” but more importantly outlined special abilities and weapons which will be the foundation for the unique kits. While Siege has Attackers and Defenders, TFW will of course feature Autobots vs Decepticons. Standard game modes like TDM, capture and hold flags, and possibly a payload mode similar to TF2s just for some variety. I like the idea of having 3rd person and 1st person options but for simplicity’s sake if I had to choose I’d say 3rd person only. As far as actual minute to minute gameplay goes, gunplay would be weighty but still have a fluid arcadey feel, kinda hard to articulate via text but I suppose the closest example would be the War For Cybertron/Fall Of Cybertron games mixed with the more immediate feedback of a game like TF2 or Overwatch. No strafing in vehicle modes, one of the issues I had with the WFC/FOC games was how transforming didn’t have a huge impact since you were basically still in robot mode just with a sprint button. I want transforming to be a give and take system, sacrificing combat for mobility. Weapons would still be featured in vehicle mode but would require more finesse to use. Transformers with animal modes would essentially be sacrificing that mobility for alternate ways to fight or support their teams. Team sizes would vary but the default would be 6 and a big team battle mode would have 10. Duplicate characters would be allowed. Characters would also have melee attacks in addition to their weapons and abilities.\n\nThe characters: this is the lifeblood of the whole project, the characters of the Transformers universe are a match made in heaven for a hero shooter with all of them having distinct silhouettes, personalities, and weapons. I think it’s important to not only draw from Generation 1 but from all eras and corners of the TF universe. As a game conceived by a fan for fans I think it’s crucial to have representatives from all major series although I won’t lie G1 will def have the most representation. I can list the characters in the comments but I’d like to launch with around 30 characters. Further updates would add more characters for free. To give a better idea of the characters and the variety I’ll list 3 Autobots and 3 Decepticons \nA1: Rhinox. Aside from G1 I’d say the Beast era is one of the most beloved eras of the TF franchise with Rhinox being among the most fondly remembered. His weapons would be his chainguns and his special ability would be a ramming shoulder charge.\nA2: Hot Shot. While the Unicron Trilogy may have suffered from poor translations and shoddy animation there’s still a lot to like about that era. Hot Shot, the now almost mandatory kid appeal character, grew to be a fairly well liked character and I think works well as a representative from this time. Weapon is an energy pistol, special ability is his hidden cannon on his back.\nA3: Windblade. The first fan created bot featured in the IDW comic books, Windblade is a great addition to the universe. Gameplay wise her weapons would be her swords, she would be exclusively melee. Her special ability would be her jump jets which would allow her to reach places other characters can’t. \n\nD1: Scorponok. That’s right, even the Japanese series of transformers are a possibility. This version of Scorponok is from the Headmasters era. His special ability would be to shoot venom darts out that do damage over time with his primary weapons being his claw cannons. \nD2: Sky-Byte. The oft-forgotten Robots In Disguise from 2001 gave way to this beloved Predacon. A lover of strategy and poetry, Sky-Bytes weapon would be his Fin Gun while his special ability would be torpedoes hidden in his shark tail arm. \nD3: Lockdown. Transformers Animated was a breath of fresh air when it came out, with stylish designs and a deceptively dark storyline. One of the key players in later seasons was Lockdown, a bounty hunter with a brutal streak. His main weapon would be his plasma hook which he could use to grab Autobots and strike them from afar or reel them in. His special ability would be his EMP Block which would disable enemy abilities for a short time.\n\nFurther Details: this section will be bullet pointed mostly for clarity but also just because it covers a variety of finer points and details.\n-Monetization: while the labor of love that is this project is reward enough, obviously people gotta eat and the game would need to be sustainable. I picture the game either being free to play or having a reduced cost, maybe $20 or $30 but that would be pushing it. There’s no story mode or really anything outside of collectibles/galleries and the core gameplay modes (at launch anyway). Cosmetics would be the key here, palette swaps would be the easy route but the fun thing about transformers is several characters exist in different eras and universes of the TF mythos and these alternate versions could function as “legendary” skins. Like the Alpha Pack system of Siege, TFW would have a similar pack system awarded by leveling up and winning games. \n-Abilities and the idea of influence: so something key I think is important is no “ultimate” abilities. I don’t like the idea of pressing a button and wiping an enemy team. 1 ability with relatively long cool downs feels like it would be a better approach both in terms of encouraging creativity and not lowering the skill ceiling. \n-Maps and objectives: so while writing this I noticed how most Autobot abilities tend to be more utilitarian or defense based while Decepticons generally have more aggressive abilities. While the other game modes above would certainly be included I think the main game mode should be an attack the base/defend the base mode. Autobots would always be the defenders, Decepticons always the attackers. Maps could range from various eras of TF but the showcase map would be The Battle Of Autobot City, a pseudo retelling of the same battle from the 1986 movie. Similar to, say, Team Fortress 2 or Star Wars Battlefront, the attacking team would have faster respawns but ofc the map would be built against them, while the defenders would have longer respawns but have more chokepoints and possibly defensive structures. Something else I’ve considered and may be more open to is MOBA style minions that spawn in, a PvEvP addition similar to Monday Night Combat or even Destiny 2s gambit mode to an extent. \n\nThere’s some ideas I haven’t fleshed out yet (Minicons, combiners and if they could even work, etc) and would love to hear suggestions and just general feedback. This was honestly really fun to write out and made me wish I had a way to visualize  but hey that’s the fun of this subreddit I guess."

ita1m5,What do you think about this Naruto game idea?,"So i came up with this idea and it felt pretty interesting to me. So I thought of a VR Naruto game. And the idea is this,it will be a battle game where every justu has a normal level(which means you have to be that level to use it) and a difficulty level. To use that kind of jutsu you have to KNOW how to do the hand signs,and it will activate when you finish the hand signs, which means the faster you do the hand signs,the faster you will use it in a fight. \n  How do you move? \n  As maybe some of you know, the japanese(i think) have invented an infinite treadmill and I thought that would be interesting to dodge other jutsu \n  I know that the VR sistem only has a stick to represent the hand in the game,but maybe in some time it will be like a glove or smth\n  (Btw i am not a game developer(yet)or anything, i just thought this would be really cool)\n   I have a lot of ideas about the concept of this game but i just wanted to know how do y all feel about this?"

I know that Russia isn't the only country it hasn't gone to but to me it is probably the most interesting idea for a Wolfenstein game.

I really enjoy the game, yet I think something with a bigger parkour focus could be more my speed than a Battle Royale, and I think some others might agree. I picture the same power-up type mechanic, and like the idea of sprinting through buildings, trains, etc.\n\nThat’s all I have to say at the moment, and, while it’s just a really bland concept, I think it might have some potential.

isaovl,Stealth Online Battle Royale,It's a 3rd/1st person shooter. Players join into a random lobby where they get dropped in random locations on the map. Nothing new so far right? yeah. BUT within this world there are NPC's that patrol around the map looking for you. Cameras placed around that have to be avoided along with traps. It would play like a Metal Gear game. If a player gets spotted they must survive a hoard of over whelming NPC's by getting away and hiding. If they die by the NPC's or other players alerted because of the commotion. They have to wait until next round or join a new lobby. The players must hunt each other down as the circle slowly closes. If players make it to the very last circle they must fight in a all out brawl. Finding silenced weapons to sneak around with and weapons that can for the most part only be used for that all out brawl at the end. Join a two man team lobbies or solo lobbies.
is5ai4,Alternate history game,"It's 1969, seven years after the Cuban missile crisis caused the cold war to go nuclear. Think the open world of Fallout with the hostility of Metro, in order to protect what could be the last strand of humanity you must prevent the launch of a new superweapon that will wipe out all life on earth permanently. Fighting against different political groups, mutated monsters and your own morality, these are your choices. These are your actions. You decide who lives and dies because only you can save everyone else."
is1xm8,Chibi Robo but violent,"It's a game idea about a little toy robot that got shipped to a house when a family left for vacation and found that a bunch of toys were having trouble and being treated terribly by the more powerful ones. \n\nIt would be an open-world game where you can mostly pick what order you fight the bosses in, except for the really gimmicky ones, and there are other toys that need jobs done, and you can help them. Collection segments, fighting segments, puzzles, etc. \n\nEvery time you accomplish something big, like defeating a boss or collecting a bunch of candies for a character that got his sweets stolen, you get a part for your little robot that changes the game. \n\nClamp hands that you can use as grappling hooks, fans that you can attach to your hands to blow enemies away, freeze rays that can freeze enemies solid, and more. I would want there to be at least 90 different parts to use and not all of them would be unique as these, but they would all bring something to the table. \n\nHere are some ideas for bosses:\n\nThe little green soldiers, but you fight a lot of them at once and you have to defeat their commander, who is in a tank. \n\nPlastic tyrannosaurus rex that you fight in a little model with volcanoes and tar pits, that sort of thing. \n\nSatanic possessed teddy bear that can use telekinesis, make hands come out of the walls, and the final phase could be the actual demon. \n\nPinball machine that traps you inside him, forcing you to try and get the highest score while dodging pinballs. \n\n\nThat's nearly all I have, so if you have any ideas, tell me, and if this gets popular, I'll make a discord server. \n\nFinally, thanks to the people who read this whole thing, and the people who sort by new."
irzvx9,A dinosaur survival game set in the Cretaceous Period,"This game is based on the premise that there was an intelligent life form here on Earth that came long before humans.  67 million years ago, there was a race of dinosaur people that walked the Earth. Essentially, they were reptoids.  They consisted of Stone Age tribal societies, and survival was a constant struggle.  You play the role of a warrior chief defending his people from the many dangers of the Cretaceous Period.\n\nThe technology is Stone Age, so the weapons are simple; spears, clubs, stone knives, bow &amp; aarow, etc. This is a survival game, and you must protect your tribe from carnivorous dinosaurs, vicious animals, and even enemy tribes.  Some missions may involve hunting in the wilderness, others may be defending your village from dinosaurs, searching caves for important items or resources, or even going into battle against a hostile tribe.\n\nYou can also trade with other tribes and form alliances.  In guilds, there could be team events where guilds are ranked based on the points that they collectively earn. There can also be guild wars, and I’d recommend that different guilds can form alliances with each other, which would allow guild wars between many guilds.  If you don’t want to worry about being constantly “farmed” by other players, then you can opt for solitary play, but then you can never join a guild."
irvj6j,"You’re a monster that has to stop people from getting in to your house, building, haunted mansion or something like that, and you have the choice to either kill them or erase their memories.","Basically you’re a monster that resides in a building that only appears at night. Tons of people want to get in to take photos, but you have to stop them to keep your existence a secret. When people enter the building, it puts them on a random floor, and depending on what floor it is it makes a different sound. If they take a lot of photos and leave, you lose and you have to start again. If you manage to catch the human before they take too many pictures, you can choose to either kill them on the spot or go to the basement to erase their memories of the place. Depending on if you killed most people, erased most people’s memories or kept it even, you would get a different ending. There would also be secret rooms in the building that give lore reveals. It would take the classic five nights formula like Fnaf where you have to survive until 6AM."
irqsrz,Woodworking game,"So I think the people who made 'PC Building Simulator' are making a woodworking simulator but I'm not too sure how in depth they plan for it to be.\n\nThe process is simple, go out a chop a tree (different trees can vary what wood you get) take it back to your workshop and create furniture or toys and stuff, then sell it for a profit.\n\nTo keep the player interested, create upgrades. For example, the player will start out in a garage with only hand tools, but as they gain more and more money they can buy machinery and power tools to make the process faster and neater.\n\nThe player could grow their own trees or buy foreign wood. They could upgrade their garage into a full workshop.\nThey can receive clients asking for specifications and the amount of care you put into the product will reflect on the price you sell it at."
irqr9v,"You drive a futuristic tank, which has its own portal and is larger on the inside, around a procedural wasteland. You try to survive hostile creature and scavenge material to build a 'tower defense' base inside the tank.","The outside of the tank is indestructible, but there is a tower defense minigame inside the tank.

You cannot let the core at the end of the tower defense base get destroyed."
irpjbf,"Among Us, but in an Agatha-Christie-like world","I'm thinking about something like ""And Then There Were None"", that is the story of a party in a mansion in an island, and people start to die, so it's obvious that one of them is the murderer, but nobody knows who it could be.\n\nI think it could be really fun to set this typo of game in an old mansion, with secret doors, and you can pick characters like the butler, the housekeeper, the maid, the gardener, the guy with the monocle, the fat lady with a cat, etc."
irm2vr,Adventure treasure hunting game revolving around the swimming mechanic,"Games often have a underwater section, but these sections are often critizised for being clunky and unfinnished. It would be cool to have a game were swimming was the main part of the game.\n\nI am picturing an adventure game were you play as someone from the Bajau people, also known as the sea nomads. These people are known to have members that can breath under water for more than 10 minutes. \n\nIt could be an interesting treasure hunting game where you need to find secrets underwater, while at the same time avoid dangerous animals and humans. \n\nYou can have skills to level up, like how long you can breath and how fast you can swim.\n\nTo be honest I don't know much about the Bajau people, I just find their relationship to the ocean fascinating, but persons from that group should be part of creating the story and setting in order to make it authentic. \n\nIn this game you are spending 90% of the time in water, so it is important that the swimming mechanic is very smooth. Streams, waves and boat traffic also influence the movement, but in a very clear way. \n\nInteresting dilemmas can be: \n- Should I go deeper in order to find more treasure, or am I risking running out of breath?\n- Should I dare to go into that underwater cave?\n- Should I aim at being a faster swimmer or focus on holding the breath longer?\n\nThe heavy focus on swimming can make the game unique, and people can also learn about the culture and maybe some history of the Bajau."

iriuif,i dont know yet, a game set during the time of the Mongol invasion of the middle east /sacking of baghdad. it would be like ghost of tsushima. there are not enough middleast set games during the middleages and the games set in the middleeast are just about fighting terrosits i feel like this would bring a new prospective and show off the Islamic golden age and the culture/society before we discovered oil and it all went to shit
irimaa,Flare,"Flair is a game I got the idea with a long time ago but I guess I'll share it with game devs that might want to give my idea life.\n\nYou play as a park ranger whom got a disturbence call from a park. You thought it was just a bear but it was more than just a bear. You go to the camp grounds and see no-one there. You go check out the area. The smell of death grows stronger and stronger to the back of one RV. There's a black monster, standing on two feet eating a person. It didnt seem to have eyes, but it had fur, the top of it's skull didnt appear to have much skin, and antlers came out of it's skull. It looked like a deer but it was a monster capable of sounding like a human. You try to leave and the government blocked off all entrances. You must use the caves and escape this wretched place.\n\nSo yeah basically it's The Forest but more focused on going to caves and stuff. Have fun with this idea."

irgk8i,Getting Over It X Fall Guys,"Okay so this is a stretch, but someone should make a game where everyone enters the lobby at once as a random object. Then, everyone is directed to one part of the map. When a person reaches that part of the map the directive changes to on top of the last person there (essentially creating a mountain of object/players). The best part about it is there would be no need for a player limit on the mountain, instead a time limit could be instated. When the time is up everyone on the mountain remains part of the game and is moved to the next lobby (this is the Fall Guys aspect of the game). Both games have been extremely popular in the past year, so naturally I thought why not combine the two?"
irdy7u,An isometric 2D game where you and a group of people are stranded on an island.,"The people elect you as their leader and you have to manage what you will do to survive. Every person could have randomized skills or something so one person could be good at swimming for example. You could tell them to go spearfishing for food. Another may be very strong so you could tell them to help with building structures or harvesting resources.\n\nMaybe the island could be home to dangerous predators so you could build walls and weapons to protect yourself. \n\nTo win the game maybe making a boat for everyone to escape on could be an option? I would think that about 100 people would be stranded on the island so the boat would have to be pretty large, it would make for a good end goal I think."

The packages must make it to the desired crate at the end of the conveyor belts, the trash must make it to the incinerator. \n\nMoney to buy pushers, drones, splitters, lifters,automation and other belt and game improvements is done with the profit you generate.\n\nYou are at the control panel, having to watch everything move at once pressing the key that goes to the correct apparatus to push trash off the line or a desired package to the right area."
iqvlnk,A mystery/puzzle game where you communicate/chat only with emojis and images,"The game interface looks like a chat app (like WhatsApp or Telegram).\n\nYou have only 1 or 2 contacts to begin with, and you have only a few (2 or 3) emojis with which to communicate.\n\nThe idea is that you can chat to these contacts using only emojis, and they respond only with emojis or with new contacts which are added to your list of contacts or pictures which are added to your gallery (e.g. photos of cute kittens, or a location or a crime scene). Once you attain these (because the contacts send them to you), you can start chatting to new contacts, communicate with new emojis and send different pictures.\n\nYou are required to chat with your contacts to progress. (Each contact could perhaps be implemented as an AI / finite state machine).\n\nAs you progress, you unlock more emojis with which to chat, and you are introduced to more contacts, and your gallery of images increases.\n\nThe progression takes place by you finding the right combination of emojis and/or images to send in response to the chat - there could be multiple paths to achieve the same goal, e.g. if you laugh at something a contact says, they might take offence or if you show a sad emoji, you might gain their friendship, or whatever. If you send a picture of something, they might respond with more information (only communicated with emojis and images).\n\nEither way, the story could follow different paths and develop in different ways, making it very complex.\n\nThere is some puzzle/mystery to solve through the game, e.g. you are supposed to reach a certain contact and get hold of a certain bit of information.\n\nThe upside to this game is that it requires very few assets - there are freely available emoji sets.\n\nThe challenge for you is to come up with a compelling story. For inspiration, why not look at the old game Captain Blood - in some ways the communication interface is a reminder of this one."
iqjbs6,A Grim game,"I was just thinking about this for a split second, but I thought it could be a great idea for a Visual novel, an Indie game, or possibly a Sim type.\n\nyou are the Grim reaper black hooded figure you don't have a face or anything and you go to people and you sit down and you talk to the person who is near death... they will have to be heartwarming and sad life stories, some good ones, and hardship. They don't always have to talk about the past but talk about the future they wanted or what they would want to change in there life, and after you listen or walked thru their story, you get to choose the hardest answer, if you take them with you and you let them live for a longer period of time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYes, this is going to be a very depressing game but that's the point, I haven't seen any game that can represent depression or hardship or sadness on other characters where you choose the ending for them, and I think after all we need to accept and release that this is a part of life that shouldn't just push under the rug. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf anyone does decide that this is a good concept I would like to be part of it and help"

Then it could add Portal which could also work good for VR. And finally Half life 2 and a half life game has already been on VR so it could work. There's not a lot of Online Multiplayer VR games so it would be nice to have TF2. And the rest of the games are just as great."

Maybe if you attempted to place a wall where mathematically it would be unstable the wall would glow red and display the problems.\n\nEssentially any random person with zero knowledge should be able to design a home with a interface as intuitive as the sims.\n\nI understand that this may not be viewed as a game, but as someone who only plays the sims to build houses I would definitely consider this a game/toy application similar to house flippers."

iq9n58,A Tycoon-Style Game but Museum Themed,"So I’ve always loved games like Zoo Tycoon and Rollercoaster Tycoon, and am really invested in the natural sciences. Combining those two and building my own museum is an idea that I’ve been obsessed with recently and have started planning out in general terms.\n\nGameplay wise it would be similar to the previously mentioned games where you can buy and place displays and different amenities in your museum. You could edit many different rooms and floors into the museum with a wall/floor/ceiling creation tool. \n\nYou would start off with only a few displays, and to acquire more you would play specific mini-games to acquire bits and pieces of different artifacts. These games would change with which field you are looking for; an example would be a digging game where you have to try and find as many fossils pieces in a certain area, or a mini Indiana-Jones themed platformer for archaeological artifacts. \n\nOther features I thought would be are:\n\n- Zone designation tools so that you could see metrics of a certain zone (income, upkeep, visitor numbers, etc.)\n\n- A storage system where all artifacts, even ones on display, would have a storage value to them. Collection cabinets would need to be bought to create more available storage. This would make museums have designated collection rooms, much like actual museums.\n\n- A charity/grant mission system where prompts will come up every so often with a goal that if reaches with grant you a reward, such as unlocking a new display or money. For example: “If you complete 3 more fossils in 3 in-game days, you’ll be awarded $5000”\n\nAny criticism or ideas are highly appreciated. Even if you just wanna say this whole thing sounds stupid, I’ll be happy to listen as long as you tell me why so I can improve it. Thanks for taking the time to read!"
iq9k7i,idk why we don't have an open world rpg that effectively teaches kids how to read by now,"I'm firm on the belief that video games are the future of education. You could fit 10x the amount resources into a video game no problem. At home learning wouldn't be an issue and neither would funding. These kids will do just about anything for in game assets. They'll figure out how to spell any word you give them if you hold character skins over their head. If we can give them that ability they'll be learning faster than you can say no. I can't imagine if this would've existed when I was a child. I understand that we lacked the technology then but we surely don't now. I feel that kids that don't know how to read would find it very beneficial to continue playing and learning about the things that they want to learn about. It'd be unimaginable to watch kids learning core curriculum at their own will. I'm not set on a specific way on how the game should run but it boils down to having everything labeled with words and giving the child the ability to spell these words for in game currency and better opportunities. When a character walks up to a cat they can pet the cat, feed the cat, and above the cat it says ""cat"". They can click on the word above/below/next to the cat and the game says ""cat, c, a, t, cat"". In another area they will be challenged to spell the word and be given in game currency if they succeed. The player should also be accompanied with a entity like Navi from the legend of Zelda that helps them to an extent with guiding them to accomplish each and every task the player is given.  The Navi would be the one spelling out each and every word the player clicks on. The world would be filled with multiple worlds. First we would give them a world full of words that start with the letter A, then the world of B's, the world of C's and so on. This would be the alphabet worlds where they can easily walk in and out of all 26 worlds with ease. Another area could be a city and contain all words associated with a city. The last area I can think of would be a world for nature. Just to create a video game like this and to make it as effective as I think it should be would equate to creating a multi million dollar development company with it's sole purpose being to education millions of children.  I find myself falling short. I wish it could be a free video game but if you can make a profit off of this idea, fucking run with it. This is only the start. I'd like to stay in the loop but more than that I want one of MY ideas to actually make it into the spotlight. I believe that my idea has meaning. This is the game I would've wanted as a child. Our education system is dreadful and everybody can attest to that. Further in developing a game like this I'm sure it'll change drastically over time. I really hope somebody takes the time to understand what I'm trying to say."

But There's a Catch!,"An action RPG where the main character (probably very muscular and handsome), can only use his fists. \n\nThe catch here is, he's a demon/monster/dragonborne/whatever, and he can use magic to power up his fists! Learning different styles of martial combat and different spells/elements to overpower his foes!\n\nA basic level up and learn techniques system would be good. Maybe just stat points to put into health/strength/magic/etc and skill points to learn Super Death Fist Ultra Punch 9000 and Mega Choke Slam Skull Cracker. \n\n\n\nI just thought of this while playing Dark Souls 2, and I wished I could do more with fists instead of having to rely on enchanting and infusing my weapons so I could super flame punch. I would want it to be a tough third person ARPG if I was a director at FromSoft or something, but if anyone wanted to do something with it then it's completely in their (maybe your) hands.

ixashd,Two-Player Party Game,"I'm thinking of a game where two players are put into a map with ~20 contestants and told to find the other without being found themselves. They'll need to mimic the NPCs' behaviour while keeping an eye on their surroundings to best their opponent. Each player gets two guesses and they lose if they get it wrong.

iwydyn,BR Racing but sorta party-ish?,"Alright this might sound goofy, but after the success of among us (a social simplistic party game), I started thinking on how else you could achieve that same kind of fun.\n\nThe idea is rough but basically you start with a decent amount of players, let’s say 30.\nYou then get on horses or maybe cars? (I’ll explain why horses would be preferable to cars later in the post) \nThe race starts and the goal is to get to first place, it’s divided into three stages, once 3 players reach the end of a stage a timer will begin for the path of the next stage to open up (this gives players the ability to take it slow and not constantly be trying to go first).\nThe map won’t be that linear, you could have rest stops and areas where you could find loot (like in any other br game) this loot won’t exclusively be guns, they could be items that you can gift to over players such as healing items or speed boosts for the race (basically making friends and earning trust)\nA player would drop everything they hold when dying, adding a “kill to get more stuff” mentality for people who want to be hostile removers of competition.\nThe standard amount of stages would be 3, but this and the amount of players could be changed.\nAlso another thing, first place wouldn’t be the only rewarding title, 2nd and 3rd would also be rewarded in a victory screen.\nThe reason I think horses would work better than cars is because the idea of riding along with a friend on a horse just seems a lot more appealing than driving alongside one, honestly their interchangeable but I think it would fit what’s going on better.\nSorry if this was scatterbrained, it’s 5AM and I’m tired.\nSorry if this game already exists or it draws top close to something like among us, I just like the idea."
iwwu4q,"Thief simulator, multiplayer.","IntroHello. I recently began to make a game, it's a first person thief simulator multiplayer game. The game is in present day and you are up to four players on this open world. You start with nothing and can go and steal stuff from the supermarket and pick pockets of npcs. You can also run around the town/world and complete quests from different npcs. It's partially story-driven but I want to keep it optional to do all the quests. The quests will however grant you xp so that you can level up and get talent points, ex for stealing faster, getting more stamina (run for longer) and gain more food-points when eating stuff. If you get busted, you will loose all of the contraband you have in your inventory and in your hands and will be in jail for X-seconds. You can however put your loot in a storage box inside the safe house. All the players have the same safe house and are able to take stuff from your box (is there any honor among thieves?).\n\nAs you may understand, this is a massive project for a single person, but I'll be damned if I cannot land this project. There is a playable beta but I need this community to help me out to make the game even better and to keep me motivated.\n\nThe multiplayer partIn this town, there are several buildings that have alarms, you can disarm the alarm, but for a short period of time and when it's about to turn on, you can disarm it again and again and again. This will grant your co-thief time to look for good items inside the house/building.\n\nThere is also even better mansions where there will be two alarms, and this require you to be three players to loot the house. There are ofc high reward for looting a mansion.\n\nEndgameThere is a bank and a vault that requires you to be four players. Two players on the alarms, one on the vault door and the last one can loot the place.\n\nThe problemThis is where I'm stuck, what more can I have as end-game-content? Why would you continue to play this game? Should there be randomized hard buildings to loot? I need idea guys. I've invested a ton of time in this game without even knowing the end-goal.\n\nJust lay it on me, all the ideas and thoughts.

iwur0z,Mental Health RPG (sorry if I used the incorrect flair),"Basically, I'm thinking of a role playing game, where along with having to save the world from certain doom, you also need to take care of the main character's mental health. The main story itself could technically be completed very quickly, but if you just do the msq and nothing else, you're likely to get a bad ending, either in the form of failing to save the world, or succeeding to save the world but leaving the hero broken by the trauma he endured through the game. So, to avoid this, there are various ""side quests"" that are done to obtain help for your hero in the form of friends/love interests to make a support group out of, doctors who can provide professional help and medicine, and various hobbies to relieve stress in the form of mini games."
iwrizt,Any ideas for a battle royale setting?,"I'm planning on creating an Unreal Engine course on multiplayer and I'd love to do so by creating a battle royale similar to Fortnite and Warzone, since everybody loves them and it's an amazing way to showcase networking. \n\nHowever, I don't want to just try to copy the exact gameplay of these games, instead I'd like to have a somewhat original theme for the game, I just can't think of anything good...  \n\n\nDoes anyone here have a good idea for a battle royale game?"
iwob1q,Procedural Grand Strategy,As the title says I want a procedural map and procedural countries with procedural names etc.
iwkpzh,An Attack On Titan Game,"I know that there’s already a plethora of attack on titan games out there, but I really want one specifically where the player character’s influence is really important.\n\nYou can make your own custom character, choose the character’s background of where they came from (this helps determine some starting stats in the game, because certain backgrounds will give a small boost in a specific stat), play through the entire storyline, be given the option to save characters so you can have it where you can rescue characters who would normally die stay alive and change the story, make your own equipment, go on missions to get more friendship with the characters, capture titans and use that to make equipment\n\nYou can also have certain characters die who would normally stay alive if you’re not careful. Basically, character influence is very important in this game. Also, you can pursue romantic relationships with the characters if you have enough friendship levels with a specific character. You can also become a Titan shifter and customize the Titan form if you have a high friendship level with one of the Titan shifters. Basically, during their reveal, they’ll ask the player if they want to join them, or if they should betray their leaders and go back on the player’s side. I know it changes the storyline a lot and seems weird, but the player character influences a lot in the game so decisions made by the player, will have an effect on the storyline of the game. You can also give gifts and interact with the characters. You can train your player, get new skills, and be able to go on missions.\n\n\nI know the idea is bad, but I honestly want to just have an attack on titan game where it lets the player get immersive and just change up the general storyline to create some interesting scenarios that wouldn’t happen in canon. I like games that let the player make decisions and where you can really get to know the characters. I think it would be interesting that if it has a bunch of different endings depending on what the player does."
iwisct,A Cowboy Bebop Game,"Naturally it wouldnt actually be a cowboy bebop game cuz copyright stuff. \n\nSo itd be like a platformer or isometric (platformer more likely) and you bounty hunt and fight (with cool animations that are like Spike's flow style). \n\nAnd youd be able to choose your bounties and have to pay off debts and daily living costs, while slowly unraveling the main character's complex backstory along with your crew's backstories. \n\nAs for the crew maybe thered be a recruitment system, certain quests, or you get them as you go in the story. Thered be a limit of members and you need certain members to access certain quests and places. To drop members you complete their stories or just fire them or something. And maybe that could trigger internal disputes and even boss fights against your own crewmates or bad guys from their own stories that come later. \n\nOf course thered be interplanetary travel and space battles and stuff\n\nThen thered be different endings, although I guess I dont really want an ending since the premise is life as a bounty hunter. Youd just keep playing until you get through everyones stories.\n\nId really like to think of cool mechanics to make the game better but it kind of doesnt need them, I think that feeling of exploration would be enough"
iwi19l,A different kind of Pokémon adventure,"What if there was a Pokémon game that made the gym challenges and all take a backseat for just one game? Instead, it could focus on breeding Pokémon and caring/nurturing for each individual one based on their natural environment and unique preferences. An important element would be the mixing of different Pokémon species resulting in a Pokémon that takes its basic anatomy after the mother, but actually shows attributes of the father mixed in. So if you crossbred a female Careacosta and a male Torterra, you could have a water and grass type Tirtouga with moss growing from it and showing design influence from the Torterra. \n\nTL;DR: Pokémon game that focuses more on combining Pokémon and making them happy, but still has a captivating story with battling and competitions"
iwevl3,"A map app, that slowly uncovers, as you explore your surroundings","So I had this idea for an app, that encourages you to go out and explore, by giving you a blank map, that slowly unravels, as you walk around. It could have secret treasure chest, which are either located at known sights, or they could be at random places, so people, who live in rural areas aren't forced to go to big cities lol. The chests could have items, that make your exploration radius bigger or things like that, and leaderboards would be a thing, which show, who explored the most areas on earth, or who explored the most in 24 hours. It would also be a cool gimmick, to give players the opportunity to make puzzles, which give you items or secret messages/ pictures, which are selected by the player, who made the puzzle."

iwaac5,dragon prince game idea, if you have netflix you can see the series and understand it its just a idea. So my concept is about third person game from dragon prince universe game would have single player and multiplayer. In multiplayer you will create your character human or elve if you create human you can chose to be with elves or with humans. in a Fast in multiplayer all players around world will do event like humans vs elves good vs evil easy but in singleplayer you will experience story from season 1 to season 3 maybe more. you will choose your character and play as that character to the end of the game. as rayla you will have acrobatic gameplay more movement style and fight style as callum you will have less action but you can learn magic and experience story through him and as Ezram you will don't have action but more puzzle style gameplay and etc. when you complete a single player as one character then you unlock free play for that character. i love to see something ike this. if you agree up vote this
iw9p9i,Fleet management RPG?,"Basically, I had an idea for a game that I’m sure exists somewhere where you manage a battle group and upgrade or construct and hire different ships. \n\nI think a mobile base/carrier kind of deal could be kind of cool for the man center of operations that you build your fleet around.  \n\nIt’s not really fleshed out at all, but someone might wanna add something to it."

ivzj8s,Slasher hide and seek,"Imagine a game like Friday 13th. But set in a typical American suburb with also NPCs (the killer has to kill the players but he can also kill the npcs). I was wondering what the players could do to survive except hiding (the players can go inside some houses), running from the killer or attacking him with different weapons.\nOne idea is of course calling the police (there’s no cell phone because is set in the 70s/80s) but the police will go away if the killer doesn’t show up or if there’s no dead body."
ivyq6t,A game with a key mechanic where you can move on walls and ceilings.,"I'm not talking wallrunning or climbing. I'm talking about jumping on a surface and then recentre yourself on that surface. You can use your controls the same way as you would on ground level.\n\nArt direction and story isn't as important as the level design and game design. Levels should take full advantage of this gameplay style making use of dangerous obstacles and creative puzzles.\n\nIf you add enemy characters, make sure they are interesting encounters. Some have limited abilities compared to yours while others have more control in a level than you. For example: an enemy type who can only move on ground floor and an enemy type who has the ability to dash and fly.\n\nThe game should not be confusing. Something on the UI or the level enviroment needs to tell you where you are."

ivwuug,A horror game where you aren't the victims,The idea I had was a game where a monster of some kind is hunting and killing the main characters except it doesn't care about you as the player.

ivqjdg,"Help needed: Enemies pick up weapons, implementation",[deleted]
ivk5ii,It came to me in a vision.,"There should be a game where whenever you launch it, it’s the same time of day where you are irl. But then until your next session, you can move time from any point in that day forward up to 23 hours 59.9998 minutes in the future irl. So then you’re not ever under any time stress, but you can learn what things happen each day of the week on repeat &amp; do quests around that weekly routine. But if you miss the time you need, you’ll have to wait until the next irl day to play again. You’d have that journal from Majora’s Mask but you’ll be in some kind of Night City-like dystopian city block. #Zelda #CyberPunk2077 #DiscoElysium helped me reach these thoughts. Thank you and you’re welcome. It’s also kinda #RogueLike in a way where if you miss your goal and quit for the day you essentially ‘died’ when you quit out the game but then 24 hours later your character resumes where they were but in some way have come back to life to try again. The longer you don’t screw up, the longer session you can play. It would cause interesting #gaming schedules. Also of course, some very difficult quests will take all through one cycle to finish successfully..if you can put all the pieces together."
ivjmmw,Give me some ideas for a game that is about spec ops,
ivhvwe,A Sims style detective game set on a space-station,"Your character lives in an idyllic, utopian space station. Everyone has their distinct identity, job and position on the space station. \n\nRecently it's been infested with shape shifting aliens, who proceed to use identities to steadily kill off passengers and replace them. \n\nYour job is to uncover the identity of the shapeshifter(s). However there a twist: everytime the player dies, they can inhabit a NEW avatar, with a new identity, job and skills.\nThey can use their new identity to access new areas, use their new skills to solve problems and so on. Solving more mysteries and completing quests for other passengers allows you to unlock their identities if you die."
ivgaaa,Magical girl styled RPG?,"While games like Hyperdimension Neptunia exist, i’d love to see something themed after magical girls that is less fan service-y or sexual, thats focused more on lore, or styling your heroes with magic powers or abilities themed to fit your playstyle.\n\nSomething RPG styled like the Tales series or Final Fantasy series, or abandon a turn based style and come up with something with more free combat like Bayonetta, a perfect example of magical girl (albeit demonic) style gameplay, though not rpg, and a bit too sexual.\n\nI realize it isnt a full idea, but im saying that, if it was available, i’d love to play something more female focused, or even mix a team of guys and girls with more magical girl series themes like transformations or magical weapons or objects, special moves designed for a final attack (Sailor Moon for example, using her Tiara or whatever weapon she uses at the time). \n\nMost games styled like this seem to be kind of on the cheaper side, not too much of a variety in area or a very generic look, and i can understand, given that the genre isnt a popular one, but i hope eventually something magical girl themed becomes popular."
ive1zq,Interesting lockpicking mechanic for a RPG game,"Helly everyone, currently I'm working on an open-world RPG game (fantasy setting) and I'm thinking about an interesting lockpicking mechanic, I would like to implement some kind of minigames (like TES series lockpicking), do you have any ideas of interesting lockpicking minigame?"
ivbezn,3D Tower / Base defense game.,"So, the title isn't very descriptive, but I can't think of another way to say it without a longer explanation.\n\nBasically, the idea is you build a base, but it's base building a la Fallout or ARK: Survival, but a bit in between.  So, pick your technology level (which determines the monster / enemy types), and you go out into the world, which is populated with said monsters and enemies of various types and you gather ingredients.  You use said ingredients to build your base, as well as defenses.  These defense are important, because semi-periodically (whether you're there or not) your base gets attacked.  If enough monsters from an area/tribe/whatever see you, they follow you (sometimes you can see them, sometimes not) back to your base and start attacking it (and you).  Otherwise it's just random groups.  Sometimes one or more from that group will escape, and bring back a bigger wave of their kind.\n\nMonsters congregate around materials types; if you want stone, you need to find cliffs or rocky areas,  where other humans, or mutant goats live.  If you want wood, you need to go to the forests, where there can be monkeys or lions or tigers or bears (oh my!).  If you want metal, you need to deep deep cave dive, where you run into goblins and mutant humans (etc).  Each ecosystem has a material type, and has a (or several) corresponding monster type.\n\nBase building works like in Fallout or ARK, in that pieces have material cost, predetermined sections, etc.  Defenses are automated based on technology level.  If you are in low low level tech, you get crossbows with corresponding platforms that things step on and trigger them.  Crossbows have a set number of 'charges', that can be increased with better versions or later a reloader that you can build.   \nIf you are in high tech, you can get up to tracking lasers.  Battery charge required.  Building passageways to funnel monsters is highly recommended.  Some monsters can climb (not all), so beware!  Other types of traps and defenses exist as well (spikes, pitfalls, boulders, shotguns, electric panels, etc).  You can repair and recharge all existing items within a menu (all at once, or individually as you like).\n\nHigh tech stuff needs more steps to build, in that you need to do more things, such as processing/refining metal and building more technological parts.  Specialized rooms are required to do certain things.  You can just place a bed anywhere, it needs a bedroom.  You can't just place a refiner anywhere, it needs a workshop.  etc.  Not everything needs a specialized room, but major components do.  You can also define an 'area' as a room type, rather than going the pre-built route, but it's more component expensive.\n\nThe most component expensive and varied things you can build come up near the end game; things that automate for you.  You want something that brings you a steady supply of dirt? Oh that's gonna cost you, and every now and then you have to check in on it as it runs out of power (after returning to your base).  You want something to harvest your food farm automatically? Needs its blades sharpened.  You want an alarm? Tripwire needs to be reset.  Some things you can't automate, such as building and repairing.  The more rare or difficult a resource, the more variety and number of components to build an automated thing to gather it.  Metal, for example, would need a LOT of metal itself to start up; not only does it need to be strong enough to harvest it, it needs protection from other things down there.  Did I mention that because the automated gatherers are dumb machines, your waves start coming more often?  % chance of being followed back to base for a machine is a lot higher than a person.  But the tradeoff is a lot more materials, more often.\n\nInventory is something to be built.  Base inventory is pretty small.  You augment it by building a backpack, then a sled, then a sled with wheels, then a wagon type thing, etc.  High tech finally gets a dimensional pocket, which drains power faster the more you put in, but has the benefit of keeping weight down.  Weight is important because it determines how fast you move.  Can't really run from bears when carrying 10 poles of wood.  Obviously numbers of that nature need to be tweaked for fun, but the concept stays the same.\n\nSaving works at your base.  You can save and load from your base as often as you want.  In the world, well..your corpse is out there.  Why do you keep getting respawned? Who keeps leaving cryptic messages with your body when you find it again?  Who's out there to see your struggle?  That comes up when your base hits a certain complexity level.\n\nMultiplayer, you can bring in friends who can join your game and help build.  They can't bring resources, but your base can be 'shared', in that you can have up to x (undetermined number) of people working together to build a base and its resources.  The base is saved between both of them. If person A is offline, and changes are made by person B, person A comes back and sees the changes made by person B, and visa versa."
ivb447,Idea for parkour games,Can you guys help me with ideas for a parkour game idea with different  game mode
ivajw8,Cops vs Racers racing game idea,"Open world cops vs racers racing game idea, similar to NFS Rivals.\n\nBackstory: 7th annual street racing competition happens on a fictional island, it's a major event that takes place around the world in different cities. Governor of the island wants to end street racing forever, and closes off the entrances to the island under an executive order until all the racers are in jail.\n\nTwo player characters:\nA cop who wants to do his duty to uphold the law, but has concerns about police brutality towards racers\n\nA racer who wants to win the competition to get enough money to afford his daughter's chemotherapy\n\nCop plot:\nCop ranks up through the department and as he does, he eventually sees the error in the government's ways. There are multiple possible endings:\n \n1) Good Betrayal Path: Cop and a few of his friends eventually turn against other cops using non-lethal methods to disable the vehicles and stop the government\n\n2) Good Path: Cop uses non-lethal means to disable racer vehicles, and when he eventually becomes the chief of police for his effort and convinces the government to open up the island again.\n\n3) Bad Betrayal Path: Cop sees that the government would only respond to violence, turns on the other cops. The government eventually sees that too many cops are dying due to their order, and opens up.\n\n4) Bad Path: Cop goes along with the government and either jails or kills every single race that had come onto the island.\n\n(I'm using good and bad as substitutes for nonviolent and violent, respectively.)\n\nI don't have any ideas for a Racer plot other than winning races and wrecking cops, and the island opening up due to the police death toll, while making friends and enemies along the way.\n\nEvent types:\n\nRaces, Pursuit Races (races with cops trying to bust the racers), and Wreckers, which is a event where 2 racers try to wreck each other, the person who gets their car wrecked loses their car. It can be initiated at any time when not in an event by the player. \n\nOpen world: The island would be about half the size of the NFS Rivals map. There would be smashable collectibles, speed cameras, and Ambush Zones, semi-enclosed spaces for racers where numerous cops are waiting to bust you, and you have to get away to get money.\n\nYou might be asking ""What happens if I get busted?"" Well, your car gets impounded and you get a fine. If you want your car back, you have to go to the impound lot and wreck all the cops there, and you get your car back. \n\nRacers buy their cars, and cops automatically get their cars when they rank up.\n\nThat's my general idea of the game. It's heavily based on NFS Rivals. Comments and criticism are welcome."

iv5wl9,New open world game idea,"So I had this clever idea for a new game. Please credit if you use it. It's sort of like GTA, but it's got better graphics and AI and has RPG mechanics. It's set in the modern day, and you can explore the whole world (Like Flight Simulator 2020 but down to individual streets and houses and furniture) and carry out different activities - from stealth missions to car chases to just opening a shop to vacuuming the floor, and you can also become the leader of a country and go to space and explore alien worlds or travel through time. The world is populated by approx 7.5 billion unique, fully voiced NPCs with procedurally generated backgrounds and quests who can form relationships with one another and go about their daily lives. Everything is physically simulated. Like you can pick up and throw boxes or dismember people and find their actual organs, also physically simulated. I'm thinking buildings can crumble like Red Faction, only better, and if you do a certain quest you can become tiny and explore little atoms that make up everything and no of course this isn't a good game idea but half the posts on the sub are like this and it's ridiculous.\n\nAnyway what do u think?"
iuqw0a,1st Person Sword Fighting Game with Mouse Control,"A first-person fighting game, where instead of using buttons to give a sort of generic swing attack, you use the mouse or joysticks to control it. There would be an ""attack mode"" in which use the mouse to swing/swipe in a very specific direction, and a ""standard mode"" which could be used for blocking. This would give really fine control over the position of the sword, and it would be especially good for a fencing game."
